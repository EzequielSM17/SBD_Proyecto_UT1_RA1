    "desc":"Brian is on his way to Canada to visit his estranged father when the pilot of his small prop plane suffers a heart attack. Brian is forced to crash-land the plane in a lake--and finds himself stranded in the remote Canadian wilderness with only his clothing and the hatchet his mother gave him as a present before his departure. Brian had been distraught over his parents' impending divorce and the secret he carries about his mother, but now he is truly desolate and alone. Exhausted, terrified, and hungry, Brian struggles to find food and make a shelter for himself. He has no special knowledge of the woods, and he must find a new kind of awareness and patience as he meets each day's challenges. Is the water safe to drink? Are the berries he finds poisonous? Slowly, Brian learns to turn adversity to his advantage--an invading porcupine unexpectedly shows him how to make fire, a devastating tornado shows him how to retrieve supplies from the submerged airplane. Most of all, Brian leaves behind the self-pity he has felt about his predicament as he summons the courage to stay alive. A story of survival and of transformation, this riveting book has sparked many a reader's interest in venturing into the wild.",

It's about this stupid snot of a kid whose parents are getting divorced (mom and dad broke up! boo-hoo :'( i'm scarred for life now!) and somehow his plane goes down in the wilderness of Canada (which I can admit is the scariest fucking thing I can possibly think of.

If this man is the pilot of a charter prop plane that you're flying alone in, you could be fucked. 2. If you eat mysterious berries, they just might give you severe diarrhea. And, having just been marooned in a plane crash, you could lack the proper facilities to expel the diarrhea within. So, you could end up shitting your brains out in a cave. Since the tender age of 9, when I glanced upon the pages of this book, I have had a fear in regards to shitting in the wild. Fuck you, Gary Paulsen."

Although this story is often on middle-school reading lists, amazingly, I've never read it myself, so I thought I better rectify this. Positives: 1. I could readily empathize with Brian's wonders, fears and accomplishments; 2. being from northern Canada myself, I was quite pleased when I correctly recognized the flora and fauna Brian encountered as food sources, such as his so-called \"gutberries\" (chokecherries), \"nutbushes\" (chestnut shrubs) and \"fool birds\" (ruffed grouse); and, 3. if read aloud or freely chosen for personal reading, I could easily see older primary and upper-elementary students enjoying this survival\/adventure story. Negatives: 1. phrasing was repetitive at times and could be distracting; and, 2. Brian's encounter with the skunk was quite the head-shaker for me - even a 6-year old wouldn't have done what Brian did! As far as survival stories involving young people go, I enjoyed this one much more than Where the Crawdads Sing , because it is more realistic\/believable to me, but the book Island of the Blue Dolphins by Scott O'Dell still tops my list!"

        "text":"Hatchet is a story about a young boy (Brian) struggling to survive after his plane crashes in a forest. He was traveling by airplane from the United States to Canada to see his father when the pilot suddenly had a heart attack. Brian lands the plane, but now he’s injured--and all alone with nothing but the hatchet his mother gave him. As Brian strives to find ways to survive, he learns and adapts to the new environment, but he faces many challenges with animals and the elements. Left to survive on his instincts and what he’s learned in the past, Brian ponders over his family situation and deals with many emotions. He’s a strong boy and becomes quite resourceful, but can he survive the Canadian wilderness? Gary Paulsen is one of my favorite authors, and it all started with this book, Hatchet . This book unequivocally is a favorite from childhood, and this is probably my third or fourth time reading it in my lifetime. This story never gets old. Brian is a relatable character, and what he’s going through feels real; in fact, this book reads like nonfiction, in my opinion. It’s adventurous, engrossing, and full of suspense. Not only that, it’s thought-provoking and makes you ask questions about what you'd do in a similar situation. How prepared would you be? Do you have what it takes to survive? What’s it like to be completely alone in the wilderness? It can make your imagination run wild, and maybe that’s just one of the reasons why kids enjoy this story so much. Readers who enjoy the outdoors or those who like survival stories will likely enjoy this book. This is a middle-grade book, but I’ve read it multiple times in adulthood and have enjoyed it all the same. Something I love about this story is Brian’s perseverance and how he learns from his mistakes. There are important lessons to learn. It’s a good story for boys, but girls will likely enjoy it too. The writing makes this a quick and easy read, but the book explores death, survival, divorce, anger, and even suicidal thoughts. Hatchet is a book I would personally recommend for young readers who struggle with reading or those who don't have an interest in reading. Definitely use your own discretion on whether your reader can handle these deeper themes though. Hatchet is book #1 in the Brian’s Saga series. I’ve read them all and will read them again and again. This is a series I’d recommend to anyone. The audio by Peter Coyote is amazing and perfectly sets the tone for this book. My kids enjoyed it along with their physical copies. 4.5-stars You can also see this review @readrantrockandroll.com"

        "text":"13-year-old Brian, a New York boy, boarded a private plane to the northern Canadian wilderness with a heavy secret. He was going to visit his father, who worked at an oil field. While he was happy to see his father, his secret weighed heavily on his heart. As he pondered his secret, the pilot suddenly suffered a heart attack and died. The sudden and shocking turn of events left him stunned. Realizing that crying wouldn't help, he forced himself to try and fly the plane. Somehow, he managed to land the plane in an unknown lake deep in the wilderness. Scrambling to safety, he realised his ordeal was far from over. Hunger, cold, swarms of mosquitoes, wild animals, and painful injuries were constant threats. Brian had no time to dwell on his secret; he had to survive. With only a hatchet, he was completely alone. He tried to recall all the survival skills he had learned, but practical application was much harder than he imagined. Desperate and defeated, Brian lay down and prepared to give up. But as he calmed down, he realized he had made a huge mistake. Knowledge and practice needed to be connected through thought and patience. Fear and death could be overcome with courage and confidence. And he hadn’t even truly tried. In this primitive wilderness, with no trace of modern civilization, Brian was the sole source of knowledge. He told himself he was his most valuable asset. In that moment, Brian was reborn. Brian gradually adapted to life in the wilderness and felt a sense of accomplishment he had never known before. He had endless tasks, new discoveries, and new goals. As this life became his norm, he began to miss his parents. He started to feel sorry for himself, questioning why he was so unlucky. But looking at his achievements, he realized that self-pity was pointless. Surviving was the greatest luck of all. He was grateful for the rising sun, the calm lake, and his delicious catches of fish and rabbit. However, Brian couldn't forget “the secret,” It was a secret about his parents' divorce that weighed heavily on him. If Brian taught us many life lessons, what should we as adults do? As parents, have we realized our responsibilities and obligations? But do we really have to be responsible for our children's lives? Life is full of hardships, and there are countless problems, worries, and unexpected accidents in the world. Should we tolerate, forgive, and compromise for the sake of others? A parent's love for their child is profound. This profound love means allowing children to develop independent personalities, equipping them to face various difficulties and life changes on their own, and preventing them from becoming self-destructive or losing their motivation due to temporary setbacks. A person's happiness and fulfillment are directly affected by whether their personality is complete and independent. Only when one is happy and fulfilled can they help and influence others. A truly independent and complete personality is characterized by a gradual detachment from dependence and a willingness to take responsibility for one's actions. Regardless of your marital status, teaching your children these things is a positive gift and a parental responsibility. We can leave our children money, houses, cars, and connections, which are valuable assets. However, teaching them how to use and manage these assets is the eternal way. Perhaps our children will never experience what Brian went through, but no one's life is perfect. In addition to material wealth, it is more important to provide spiritual guidance and support, and to help them apply the knowledge they have learned to practical situations as much as possible, then let them go. Teaching someone to fish can solve a lifetime of hunger. 3.4 \/ 5"

        "text":"I have to be honest. At first I was having a serious 'really?' moment as I started listening. The 'really?' was because this is a three-time Newberry Award winner, and I thought the prose was way too repetitive. The same word would be repeated three times. The same sentences twice. I was steeling myself to keep listening and hope it got better. It did. By the end of this novel, I totally realized why it is a Newberry Award winner. Hatchet is a story of survival. The protagonist is a thirteen-year-old city boy who ends up stranded in the Canadian wilderness when the pilot of the small plane he's flying in has a heart attack and dies. I have to tell you, I am very impressed with this kid. I think I would have freaked like nobody's business. He does freak out at first (and I don't blame him), but ultimately shows a fortitude that inspires awe in this reader. He goes from a scared, helpless boy to a survivor. The Brian that was has to be broken down and reassembled into a Brian that can survive his new reality. He learns how to meet his needs in the harsh wilderness, and he comes out of it forever changed. I love reading books\/watching tv shows and movies about surviving. I don't know why, really. I don't even go camping or hiking, although I love the outdoors. I think it's because I love the idea of a person being resourceful and pitting their skills and mentality against the unprejudiced, often unsympathetic wild. Not conquering it, but learning to live in harmony, becoming a part of a vast ecosystem in a way that we can't do stuck in our comfortable city and surburban environs, another entity in the web of life. I would definitely recommend this book if you are of a similar mind. I liked that Brian doesn't get it too easy. Not at all. He has to learn from his mistakes, and take the advantages that providence sends his way. He learns to keep food in his belly, to make a secure shelter, and to appreciate and anticipate the dangers of his environment. And in the process, he finds peace. He looks inside and finds his true self. That's what solitude and a oneness with nature will bring. I have always felt my most at peace in two places: in a spirit-filled church or by myself and with my heart open in prayer; and outside, surrounded by nature. So I really appreciated this aspect of the book. Brian starts out a boy who is emotionally lost at sea when his father and mother divorce, weighted down with the knowledge of his mother's infidelity; and finds that what seemed like tragedy and the end of his world will not conquer him. If he can survive the harsh elements of nature, all by himself, he can live with his family's fragmentation, and live to see the next day and the days after that. I think this book is a metaphor for life. Life is harsh and we have to grow and change to survive it. We can't give up, descend into pity, and expect to be saved. We have to be strong and fight to save ourselves, whether it's physically, mentally, or emotionally. Although this book had a very shaky start, I do have to agree that this is a winner. And I tell you what, this young man had a lot of lessons to teach me, lessons he learns the hard way. That's the power of a good fiction novel for me."

        "text":"Some books imprint themselves on your mind and stay with you. You can remember vividly where you were when you first read them. Hatchet is one of those books for me. I remember being in Mrs. Alison’s sixth grade class, and this book was raging though the male half of my class like a wildfire. Even boys who usually hated reading couldn’t put it down. Obviously, as the class’s self-proclaimed queen of the bookworms, I wanted to know what all the fuss was about. So, when a copy finally made it back to the book cubbies that lined the back of the classroom, I nabbed it. And I totally saw what the fuss was about. Survival stories have been popular for centuries. Robinson Crusoe, Kidnapped, The Swiss Family Robinson; even The Odyssey had survival aspects. So what was so special about Hatchet? It was the story of a thirteen-year-old plane-crash victim struggling to survive in the Canadian wilderness. Alone. With nothing but his hatchet. This was a main character who was close to our age. Who was struggling to accept the recent divorce of his parents, which was something that multiple kids in our class were going through, and that the rest of us feared. Who had absolutely none of the knowledge and skills seemingly necessary to make it in the wild. Like the rest of us. Seriously, what middle school kid would actually know what to do if they were dropped in the woods, alone, with no supplies and no tools except for a hatchet? If we’re honest, most of us as adults would have no clue what to do, either. One thing about kids, though; they don’t know enough yet to doubt their ability to survive anything. Kids believe that death doesn’t apply to them, and in some ways that’s the only way one could survive this type of dire situation. And survive Brian does. But Paulsen doesn’t pull punches; this is not a romanticized survival story, where food falls in the protagonist’s lap and they never get so much as a blister. Brian gets put through the wringer. This poor child get severely sunburned, violently ill from bad fruit, attacked by various forest dwellers, and more. Not to mention the near starvation he is constantly battling. As a twelve-year-old, this book was terrifying and empowering and completely enthralling. I’ve read it six more times since then, and it’s still all of those things, with a healthy dose of nostalgia thrown in. So thanks, boys in my class, for getting me interested. If you’re a parent, you should definitely get this book for your kids. If you’re still a kid at heart and have never read this, track down a copy. You never know; the things you learn from this book could save your life if you ever get stranded alone in the middle of a forest."

I love it when I am searching for an audiobook and books like this pop up as available. I think, “Ah ha! I can finally get to this one!” It did not take me long to get through Hatchet during my daily lunchtime walks. It held my interest throughout, but probably wasn’t even long enough to lose it! It is definitely geared toward pre and early teens – however, there are a couple of more difficult topics (like death and survival) that this might be a kids first introduction to (unless they are like me and started reading Stephen King at 12!) If my kids decide to try this one out, I will be there for them if they have any questions about it. Should you read this book? It is not bad for a quick read, but it may prove to be too simple for some peoples’ tastes. If you can adjust your mindset and think of it like a 10- to 13-year-old would, I think you will appreciate it more. Luckily, as I mentioned it is not very long, you are not committing too much of your time if it ends up not being your cup of tea."

There is also a divorce theme going on as Brian's parents have recently split. This is your typical survival tale. Brian does face some harsh environments and he learns to be tough physically and more importantly - mentally. He doesn't give in to feeling sorry for himself. This is very well written and there is a reason it is so popular. I will read more of the Brian Saga."

        "text":"Despite some of the repetition getting annoying from time to time, Hatchet is an engrossing story of survival for a young boy unfortunate enough to endure a plane crash to become stranded in the Canadian wilderness. For the most part the story sticks to realistic stuff, concentrating mainly on hunger and food. So many other survival stories focus on more, but really the basics of food and hunger and survival would be the forefront issue most would encounter if stranded alone. It sets in fast and it's almost constant. Brian shows he has what it takes to survive, but the author doesn't make the child come across as anything super since he shows that nature is uncontrollable and that it's luck of the draw for us all. The author even ends the narrative of the story saying that if Brian had been unlucky enough to be stranded during wintertime in the Canadian wilderness, he very likely wouldn't have survived at all. His dependency on the lake is the only reason he made it past the first few days, and then subsequent months, but a frozen lake would have nixed that. Although realistic with its focus on hunger and survival, it did have an unlikely tornado that felt contrived. Still the story can be forgiven this, as it focused on things like swarms of mosquitoes, baking sun, a random rude moose and other concerns. Brian didn't venture far from the landing, and I'm not sure I would have either. Some would venture far to try and find salvation themselves but he stuck to one area and stayed close to the shelter and food\/water supply that were guaranteed to be sure. A more cautious method that worked. Not sure what I would have done in his circumstances, but I see the point that the chances of shelter like that would have been few and far between. Written for children, it's more interesting and educational than upsetting. I do wish the author had spent more time granting us a deeper afterword. I realize the point of the story was the struggle, but I like to see more time involved with the after effect. Just a pet peeve of mine. We did get a small one at least. Besides the survival story being the focus, the Secret also weighed heavy in his mind, and ends up being a continuous thing he has to carry. The story ties into the Hatchet being the main tool he used to get started, but I do have to wonder why kind of random present that is that a mother gives a young boy. Either way, came in handy. Even if the repetition with the writer's style grew too much at times, it was to the point and paced well. I can see why it won so many children's awards, including Newberry Honor."

Just listened to Peter Coyote read it while riding back from Yellowstone, and loved it. Great story, well told, well read. An adventure story in part based on tough guy (with a big heart) Paulson's own survival of a plane crash and other near death experiences. When I think of that kid there finding ways to survive at a lake in Nowhere, Canada, miles from civilization, I see it precisely, I have been there, in the way of the best books. And some genuine heart-pumping moments. Paulsen's great achievement. How is it it rates only 3.61 from GR readers?! Read it, or read it again, in honor of this great book, probably written for middle grades, but really all-ages in the way of classics. Great book!!"

It was definitly in elementary school, because I remember it was at the same time that we we doing \"survival skills\"* in Girl Scouts. Not that I ever wanted to be trapped by myself in the wilderness, but I spent a lot of my time in my backyard pretending to find flint with my sister, and starting imaginary fires to keep warm. In winter we dug ourselves igloos. I always went camping with my parents, so this book started a lot of Q&A's with them about what to do if I get lost in the woods (Hint, No. 1 is STAY WHERE YOU ARE!). Any ways, its a great read for an elementary kid, and everyone should read it. * This was put in quotation marks because it was a total joke. I had been looking forward to these skills for quite some time, finally girl scouts was going to teach me what I wanted! Instead of knives they handed us popsicle sticks. For the love of God CUB SCOUTS get real knives. This was followed shortly on the heels of an outdoor cooking class where none of us were allowed near the fire. Basically we made banana boats, and then the instructor put the boats in and out of the coals for us. We learned how to build a fire with coals, not tinder. Agh. It was at this point that I decided Girl Scouts was NOT for me."

Brian certainly had a lot of hardship and how ironic that when he finds after 2 months of hell, a survival pack from the crash with a sleeping bag, gun, cooking stuff and copious amounts of dried food, a plane lands to rescue him before he's even had a spoonful! We began to find it amusing just how unlucky Brian managed to be! And phew! noticing this was a series of books we wondered if he would get rescued! But luckily for Brian he does! The cover on this book is a perfect example of an illustrator not reading the story, again and again we are told how Brian is weather beaten and sunburnt to a crisp, and yet the cover picture makes me think of a 1980s new romantic look complete with black eyeliner!

        "text":"So when I added this, I vaguely recalled the title, and I swear, I have definitely read it, but what I thought it was about was a boy being stuck under the snow following an avalanche (it turns out the book I was thinking of is apty named Avalanche by Arthur Roth) but anyway, that's not what it is about, and I really don't remember this book at all. Hatchet I definitely read in middle school at the instruction of my librarian (we had a sort of once-weekly class in the library to introduce us to the already anachronistic card catalog, and maybe to encourage us to read). It strikes me now as one of those \"boy books\" and was sort of offered to me as an alternative to Babysitters' Club or Nancy Drew, maybe. It's strange now, because it undervalues literature very much to say that some is suited to boys, and others to girls (which is to say nothing of our society's pathetic need to classify and categorize). Based on my vague and unreliable memory (and the description gleaned from amazon), here are the reasons why you should have your son, nephew, homeless male orphan read Hatchet : 1) It is the story about a boy named Brian. Brian is a great boy name (maybe you've considered it for your tot?), and everything he does (probably) exudes the same brand of outdoorsy masculinity that you want your little Timmy, Tommy or Teddy to adopt as an adolescent and adult. 2) It takes place outside. What better way to encourage kids to go outside than to have them sit inside and read a book about a boy who is outside? 3) There is a hatchet, presumably. Whether little Johnny has that lumberjack vibe, or that investment banker gone Sarsgaard-murder-house vibe, certainly it will be important to introduce them to the concept of the hatchet. A very useful tool that almost no one uses, as far as I know. 4) The plot evidently features a plane crash, wherein Brian must be the lone survivor. Very likely to happen. Also, surely all the characters in this book are male, what better way to introduce your young one to a realistic view of the world than to immerse them in world dominated completely by a young boy and some owls, or something. (also see: Lord of the Flies ) 5. This 20th anniversary edition features a great commentary by the author, Gary Paulson. Even though your little brat probably won't read this (why would he?), it will give his ego the small boost for the illusion of having read a book a little longer than he actually did). 6. This is the first installation of a SAGA. For one, \"saga\" is reminiscent to me of the Nordic mythos, which seems to be the most supporting of the idealized male image. It also means there are multiple volumes following our intrepid Brian. What more could you want? Why invest in Boy Scouts when you could drop a pile of Brian books in your kid's lap and turn him into a man, while saving all that time and money? Get it! So good!"

The first thing Brain did after he crashed was he panicked, he felt lost, and he missed his family. The author described other emotions Brian felt when he was alone in the forest like hopelessness, desperation, and hunger. Every time the author expressed a feeling, it would always paint a realistic picture in my head, sometimes sending chills down my spine. I wondered “If I was in that situation, what would I do?” Although I think I would lose hope in these situations, I will get myself together and try my best to keep my self from negative emotions and hunger. It's in human nature to have a strong desire to survive. Reading this book reminded me of the movie \"The life of Pi.\" Surviving on a boat with a tiger for 227 days?! I would rather drown myself. What made Pi survive was faith. When you have faith, you have hope. When you have hope, you can see the light at the end of the tunnel. That's what motivates you to overcome difficulties and achieve your dream. Faith is what made me get up 6 o'clock in the morning to attend swimming lessons. I am still young, there will be a lot of difficulties I will be facing in my life, but I think as long as I have faith in myself, I believe I can overcome a lot of challenges and achieve my dreams."

The reason as well as the divorce itself are eating away at Brian. That is until his pilot has a heart attack and he crashes in the middle of the Canadian wilderness and has to get creative in order to survive. The book is relatively minimalist, but that in no way makes it less good. It's the story of a boy and nature and the unbreakable spirit of some people. I wish this kind of survivalist story was (still) more popular. Because neither children nor adults are generally this knowledgeable about nature anymore. Most just stand around and scream whenever anything happens. Yes, I'm one of the kids who spent a lot of time outside. I watched TV, I got a computer as a teen, my parents weren't some hippies, but I was also outside a lot and learned about making fire and finding shelter, knowing what to eat and what not when in a forest. I have colleages 10 years my senior who didn't even realize that the \"large chicken breasts\" their butcher often has aren't chicken breasts but turkey breasts and that those are two very different animals. *rolls eyes* So I really enjoyed the can-do spirit, the learning curve (that the boy was neither hysterical nor unrealistically faultless in his actions), the progression of the time spent in the wild, the Boy Scout feel of it all. I can see why so many have read this book, often in school, in the past; and why a lot of kids might dig this. It wasn't perfect, but it was a pretty neat adventure with high stakes that teaches the reader a lot about mental attitude and fortitude."

Another second later, I realized it wasn't because the survival trope was so damn common. It was because I HAD read it and just plain forgot it. Huh. Well, anyway, it made me think about how survival tropes haven't really been around anymore. I mean, sure, we have Hunger Games and just about every Anime out there, but there's not too much in modern lit, not that I've seen. Notable examples to the contrary are Life of Pi, etc., but many of these serve as either satire or dark commentary. Whatever happened to this kind of genre, especially SF? Heinlein's juveniles used to be full of it. How odd. Oh? What about this book? lol It's fine. It made me angry and nostalgic in turn. Mostly entirely because of the Boy Scouts. I remember survival training and then I remembered that the whole thing of the BOY SCOUTS is dead now. Survival training and survival literature have both died. I think that's kinda ironic."

I could readily empathize with Brian's wonders, fears and accomplishments; 2. being from northern Canada myself, I was quite pleased when I correctly recognized the flora and fauna Brian encountered as food sources, such as his so-called \"gutberries\" (chokecherries), \"nutbushes\" (chestnut shrubs) and \"fool birds\" (ruffed grouse); and, 3. if read aloud or freely chosen for personal reading, I could easily see older primary and upper-elementary students enjoying this survival\/adventure story.

        "text":"Hatchet is a story about a young boy (Brian) struggling to survive after his plane crashes in a forest. He was traveling by airplane from the United States to Canada to see his father when the pilot suddenly had a heart attack. Brian lands the plane, but now he’s injured--and all alone with nothing but the hatchet his mother gave him. As Brian strives to find ways to survive, he learns and adapts to the new environment, but he faces many challenges with animals and the elements. Left to survive on his instincts and what he’s learned in the past, Brian ponders over his family situation and deals with many emotions. He’s a strong boy and becomes quite resourceful, but can he survive the Canadian wilderness? Gary Paulsen is one of my favorite authors, and it all started with this book, Hatchet . This book unequivocally is a favorite from childhood, and this is probably my third or fourth time reading it in my lifetime. This story never gets old. Brian is a relatable character, and what he’s going through feels real; in fact, this book reads like nonfiction, in my opinion. It’s adventurous, engrossing, and full of suspense. Not only that, it’s thought-provoking and makes you ask questions about what you'd do in a similar situation. How prepared would you be? Do you have what it takes to survive? What’s it like to be completely alone in the wilderness? It can make your imagination run wild, and maybe that’s just one of the reasons why kids enjoy this story so much. Readers who enjoy the outdoors or those who like survival stories will likely enjoy this book. This is a middle-grade book, but I’ve read it multiple times in adulthood and have enjoyed it all the same. Something I love about this story is Brian’s perseverance and how he learns from his mistakes. There are important lessons to learn. It’s a good story for boys, but girls will likely enjoy it too. The writing makes this a quick and easy read, but the book explores death, survival, divorce, anger, and even suicidal thoughts. Hatchet is a book I would personally recommend for young readers who struggle with reading or those who don't have an interest in reading. Definitely use your own discretion on whether your reader can handle these deeper themes though. Hatchet is book #1 in the Brian’s Saga series. I’ve read them all and will read them again and again. This is a series I’d recommend to anyone. The audio by Peter Coyote is amazing and perfectly sets the tone for this book. My kids enjoyed it along with their physical copies. 4.5-stars You can also see this review @readrantrockandroll.com"

        "text":"13-year-old Brian, a New York boy, boarded a private plane to the northern Canadian wilderness with a heavy secret. He was going to visit his father, who worked at an oil field. While he was happy to see his father, his secret weighed heavily on his heart. As he pondered his secret, the pilot suddenly suffered a heart attack and died. The sudden and shocking turn of events left him stunned. Realizing that crying wouldn't help, he forced himself to try and fly the plane. Somehow, he managed to land the plane in an unknown lake deep in the wilderness. Scrambling to safety, he realised his ordeal was far from over. Hunger, cold, swarms of mosquitoes, wild animals, and painful injuries were constant threats. Brian had no time to dwell on his secret; he had to survive. With only a hatchet, he was completely alone. He tried to recall all the survival skills he had learned, but practical application was much harder than he imagined. Desperate and defeated, Brian lay down and prepared to give up. But as he calmed down, he realized he had made a huge mistake. Knowledge and practice needed to be connected through thought and patience. Fear and death could be overcome with courage and confidence. And he hadn’t even truly tried. In this primitive wilderness, with no trace of modern civilization, Brian was the sole source of knowledge. He told himself he was his most valuable asset. In that moment, Brian was reborn. Brian gradually adapted to life in the wilderness and felt a sense of accomplishment he had never known before. He had endless tasks, new discoveries, and new goals. As this life became his norm, he began to miss his parents. He started to feel sorry for himself, questioning why he was so unlucky. But looking at his achievements, he realized that self-pity was pointless. Surviving was the greatest luck of all. He was grateful for the rising sun, the calm lake, and his delicious catches of fish and rabbit. However, Brian couldn't forget “the secret,” It was a secret about his parents' divorce that weighed heavily on him. If Brian taught us many life lessons, what should we as adults do? As parents, have we realized our responsibilities and obligations? But do we really have to be responsible for our children's lives? Life is full of hardships, and there are countless problems, worries, and unexpected accidents in the world. Should we tolerate, forgive, and compromise for the sake of others? A parent's love for their child is profound. This profound love means allowing children to develop independent personalities, equipping them to face various difficulties and life changes on their own, and preventing them from becoming self-destructive or losing their motivation due to temporary setbacks. A person's happiness and fulfillment are directly affected by whether their personality is complete and independent. Only when one is happy and fulfilled can they help and influence others. A truly independent and complete personality is characterized by a gradual detachment from dependence and a willingness to take responsibility for one's actions. Regardless of your marital status, teaching your children these things is a positive gift and a parental responsibility. We can leave our children money, houses, cars, and connections, which are valuable assets. However, teaching them how to use and manage these assets is the eternal way. Perhaps our children will never experience what Brian went through, but no one's life is perfect. In addition to material wealth, it is more important to provide spiritual guidance and support, and to help them apply the knowledge they have learned to practical situations as much as possible, then let them go. Teaching someone to fish can solve a lifetime of hunger. 3.4 \/ 5"

        "text":"I have to be honest. At first I was having a serious 'really?' moment as I started listening. The 'really?' was because this is a three-time Newberry Award winner, and I thought the prose was way too repetitive. The same word would be repeated three times. The same sentences twice. I was steeling myself to keep listening and hope it got better. It did. By the end of this novel, I totally realized why it is a Newberry Award winner. Hatchet is a story of survival. The protagonist is a thirteen-year-old city boy who ends up stranded in the Canadian wilderness when the pilot of the small plane he's flying in has a heart attack and dies. I have to tell you, I am very impressed with this kid. I think I would have freaked like nobody's business. He does freak out at first (and I don't blame him), but ultimately shows a fortitude that inspires awe in this reader. He goes from a scared, helpless boy to a survivor. The Brian that was has to be broken down and reassembled into a Brian that can survive his new reality. He learns how to meet his needs in the harsh wilderness, and he comes out of it forever changed. I love reading books\/watching tv shows and movies about surviving. I don't know why, really. I don't even go camping or hiking, although I love the outdoors. I think it's because I love the idea of a person being resourceful and pitting their skills and mentality against the unprejudiced, often unsympathetic wild. Not conquering it, but learning to live in harmony, becoming a part of a vast ecosystem in a way that we can't do stuck in our comfortable city and surburban environs, another entity in the web of life. I would definitely recommend this book if you are of a similar mind. I liked that Brian doesn't get it too easy. Not at all. He has to learn from his mistakes, and take the advantages that providence sends his way. He learns to keep food in his belly, to make a secure shelter, and to appreciate and anticipate the dangers of his environment. And in the process, he finds peace. He looks inside and finds his true self. That's what solitude and a oneness with nature will bring. I have always felt my most at peace in two places: in a spirit-filled church or by myself and with my heart open in prayer; and outside, surrounded by nature. So I really appreciated this aspect of the book. Brian starts out a boy who is emotionally lost at sea when his father and mother divorce, weighted down with the knowledge of his mother's infidelity; and finds that what seemed like tragedy and the end of his world will not conquer him. If he can survive the harsh elements of nature, all by himself, he can live with his family's fragmentation, and live to see the next day and the days after that. I think this book is a metaphor for life. Life is harsh and we have to grow and change to survive it. We can't give up, descend into pity, and expect to be saved. We have to be strong and fight to save ourselves, whether it's physically, mentally, or emotionally. Although this book had a very shaky start, I do have to agree that this is a winner. And I tell you what, this young man had a lot of lessons to teach me, lessons he learns the hard way. That's the power of a good fiction novel for me."

        "text":"Some books imprint themselves on your mind and stay with you. You can remember vividly where you were when you first read them. Hatchet is one of those books for me. I remember being in Mrs. Alison’s sixth grade class, and this book was raging though the male half of my class like a wildfire. Even boys who usually hated reading couldn’t put it down. Obviously, as the class’s self-proclaimed queen of the bookworms, I wanted to know what all the fuss was about. So, when a copy finally made it back to the book cubbies that lined the back of the classroom, I nabbed it. And I totally saw what the fuss was about. Survival stories have been popular for centuries. Robinson Crusoe, Kidnapped, The Swiss Family Robinson; even The Odyssey had survival aspects. So what was so special about Hatchet? It was the story of a thirteen-year-old plane-crash victim struggling to survive in the Canadian wilderness. Alone. With nothing but his hatchet. This was a main character who was close to our age. Who was struggling to accept the recent divorce of his parents, which was something that multiple kids in our class were going through, and that the rest of us feared. Who had absolutely none of the knowledge and skills seemingly necessary to make it in the wild. Like the rest of us. Seriously, what middle school kid would actually know what to do if they were dropped in the woods, alone, with no supplies and no tools except for a hatchet? If we’re honest, most of us as adults would have no clue what to do, either. One thing about kids, though; they don’t know enough yet to doubt their ability to survive anything. Kids believe that death doesn’t apply to them, and in some ways that’s the only way one could survive this type of dire situation. And survive Brian does. But Paulsen doesn’t pull punches; this is not a romanticized survival story, where food falls in the protagonist’s lap and they never get so much as a blister. Brian gets put through the wringer. This poor child get severely sunburned, violently ill from bad fruit, attacked by various forest dwellers, and more. Not to mention the near starvation he is constantly battling. As a twelve-year-old, this book was terrifying and empowering and completely enthralling. I’ve read it six more times since then, and it’s still all of those things, with a healthy dose of nostalgia thrown in. So thanks, boys in my class, for getting me interested. If you’re a parent, you should definitely get this book for your kids. If you’re still a kid at heart and have never read this, track down a copy. You never know; the things you learn from this book could save your life if you ever get stranded alone in the middle of a forest."

I love it when I am searching for an audiobook and books like this pop up as available. I think, “Ah ha! I can finally get to this one!” It did not take me long to get through Hatchet during my daily lunchtime walks. It held my interest throughout, but probably wasn’t even long enough to lose it! It is definitely geared toward pre and early teens – however, there are a couple of more difficult topics (like death and survival) that this might be a kids first introduction to (unless they are like me and started reading Stephen King at 12!) If my kids decide to try this one out, I will be there for them if they have any questions about it. Should you read this book? It is not bad for a quick read, but it may prove to be too simple for some peoples’ tastes. If you can adjust your mindset and think of it like a 10- to 13-year-old would, I think you will appreciate it more.

Brian has to survive in the Canadian Woods on his own for a summer. He learns to make fire, shelter and hunt for fish and birds. There is also a divorce theme going on as Brian's parents have recently split. This is your typical survival tale. Brian does face some harsh environments and he learns to be tough physically and more importantly - mentally. He doesn't give in to feeling sorry for himself. This is very well written and there is a reason it is so popular. I will read more of the Brian Saga."

        "text":"Despite some of the repetition getting annoying from time to time, Hatchet is an engrossing story of survival for a young boy unfortunate enough to endure a plane crash to become stranded in the Canadian wilderness. For the most part the story sticks to realistic stuff, concentrating mainly on hunger and food. So many other survival stories focus on more, but really the basics of food and hunger and survival would be the forefront issue most would encounter if stranded alone. It sets in fast and it's almost constant. Brian shows he has what it takes to survive, but the author doesn't make the child come across as anything super since he shows that nature is uncontrollable and that it's luck of the draw for us all. The author even ends the narrative of the story saying that if Brian had been unlucky enough to be stranded during wintertime in the Canadian wilderness, he very likely wouldn't have survived at all. His dependency on the lake is the only reason he made it past the first few days, and then subsequent months, but a frozen lake would have nixed that. Although realistic with its focus on hunger and survival, it did have an unlikely tornado that felt contrived. Still the story can be forgiven this, as it focused on things like swarms of mosquitoes, baking sun, a random rude moose and other concerns. Brian didn't venture far from the landing, and I'm not sure I would have either. Some would venture far to try and find salvation themselves but he stuck to one area and stayed close to the shelter and food\/water supply that were guaranteed to be sure. A more cautious method that worked. Not sure what I would have done in his circumstances, but I see the point that the chances of shelter like that would have been few and far between. Written for children, it's more interesting and educational than upsetting. I do wish the author had spent more time granting us a deeper afterword. I realize the point of the story was the struggle, but I like to see more time involved with the after effect. Just a pet peeve of mine. We did get a small one at least. Besides the survival story being the focus, the Secret also weighed heavy in his mind, and ends up being a continuous thing he has to carry. The story ties into the Hatchet being the main tool he used to get started, but I do have to wonder why kind of random present that is that a mother gives a young boy. Either way, came in handy. Even if the repetition with the writer's style grew too much at times, it was to the point and paced well. I can see why it won so many children's awards, including Newberry Honor."

Just listened to Peter Coyote read it while riding back from Yellowstone, and loved it. Great story, well told, well read. An adventure story in part based on tough guy (with a big heart) Paulson's own survival of a plane crash and other near death experiences. When I think of that kid there finding ways to survive at a lake in Nowhere, Canada, miles from civilization, I see it precisely, I have been there, in the way of the best books. And some genuine heart-pumping moments. Paulsen's great achievement. How is it it rates only 3.61 from GR readers?!

For the love of God CUB SCOUTS get real knives. This was followed shortly on the heels of an outdoor cooking class where none of us were allowed near the fire. Basically we made banana boats, and then the instructor put the boats in and out of the coals for us. We learned how to build a fire with coals, not tinder. Agh.

Hatchet I definitely read in middle school at the instruction of my librarian (we had a sort of once-weekly class in the library to introduce us to the already anachronistic card catalog, and maybe to encourage us to read). It strikes me now as one of those \"boy books\" and was sort of offered to me as an alternative to Babysitters' Club or Nancy Drew, maybe. It's strange now, because it undervalues literature very much to say that some is suited to boys, and others to girls (which is to say nothing of our society's pathetic need to classify and categorize). Based on my vague and unreliable memory (and the description gleaned from amazon), here are the reasons why you should have your son, nephew, homeless male orphan read Hatchet : 1) It is the story about a boy named Brian. Brian is a great boy name (maybe you've considered it for your tot?), and everything he does (probably) exudes the same brand of outdoorsy masculinity that you want your little Timmy, Tommy or Teddy to adopt as an adolescent and adult. 2) It takes place outside. What better way to encourage kids to go outside than to have them sit inside and read a book about a boy who is outside? 3) There is a hatchet, presumably. Whether little Johnny has that lumberjack vibe, or that investment banker gone Sarsgaard-murder-house vibe, certainly it will be important to introduce them to the concept of the hatchet. A very useful tool that almost no one uses, as far as I know. 4) The plot evidently features a plane crash, wherein Brian must be the lone survivor. Very likely to happen. Also, surely all the characters in this book are male, what better way to introduce your young one to a realistic view of the world than to immerse them in world dominated completely by a young boy and some owls, or something. (also see: Lord of the Flies ) 5. This 20th anniversary edition features a great commentary by the author, Gary Paulson. Even though your little brat probably won't read this (why would he?), it will give his ego the small boost for the illusion of having read a book a little longer than he actually did). 6. This is the first installation of a SAGA. For one, \"saga\" is reminiscent to me of the Nordic mythos, which seems to be the most supporting of the idealized male image. It also means there are multiple volumes following our intrepid Brian. What more could you want? Why invest in Boy Scouts when you could drop a pile of Brian books in your kid's lap and turn him into a man, while saving all that time and money? Get it! So good!"

The first thing Brain did after he crashed was he panicked, he felt lost, and he missed his family. The author described other emotions Brian felt when he was alone in the forest like hopelessness, desperation, and hunger. Every time the author expressed a feeling, it would always paint a realistic picture in my head, sometimes sending chills down my spine. I wondered “If I was in that situation, what would I do?” Although I think I would lose hope in these situations, I will get myself together and try my best to keep my self from negative emotions and hunger. It's in human nature to have a strong desire to survive. Reading this book reminded me of the movie \"The life of Pi.\" Surviving on a boat with a tiger for 227 days?! I would rather drown myself. What made Pi survive was faith. When you have faith, you have hope. When you have hope, you can see the light at the end of the tunnel. That's what motivates you to overcome difficulties and achieve your dream. Faith is what made me get up 6 o'clock in the morning to attend swimming lessons. I am still young, there will be a lot of difficulties I will be facing in my life, but I think as long as I have faith in myself, I believe I can overcome a lot of challenges and achieve my dreams."

The reason as well as the divorce itself are eating away at Brian.

The book is relatively minimalist, but that in no way makes it less good. It's the story of a boy and nature and the unbreakable spirit of some people. I wish this kind of survivalist story was (still) more popular. Because neither children nor adults are generally this knowledgeable about nature anymore. Most just stand around and scream whenever anything happens. Yes, I'm one of the kids who spent a lot of time outside. I watched TV, I got a computer as a teen, my parents weren't some hippies, but I was also outside a lot and learned about making fire and finding shelter, knowing what to eat and what not when in a forest. I have colleages 10 years my senior who didn't even realize that the \"large chicken breasts\" their butcher often has aren't chicken breasts but turkey breasts and that those are two very different animals. *rolls eyes* So I really enjoyed the can-do spirit, the learning curve (that the boy was neither hysterical nor unrealistically faultless in his actions), the progression of the time spent in the wild, the Boy Scout feel of it all. I can see why so many have read this book, often in school, in the past; and why a lot of kids might dig this.

        "text":"I was roped into reading this classic YA for reasons, not realizing I had actually read it way back when I was in school in 7th grade. I started reading it and said, \"Damn, I hate it when authors use this kind of tone for kids, emphasizing 'secret' so damn much in extremely short and supposedly powerful ways that just sounds so faux-mysterious.\" A second later it dawned on me that I knew the rest of the story. Another second later, I realized it wasn't because the survival trope was so damn common. It was because I HAD read it and just plain forgot it. Huh. Well, anyway, it made me think about how survival tropes haven't really been around anymore. I mean, sure, we have Hunger Games and just about every Anime out there, but there's not too much in modern lit, not that I've seen. Notable examples to the contrary are Life of Pi, etc., but many of these serve as either satire or dark commentary. Whatever happened to this kind of genre, especially SF? Heinlein's juveniles used to be full of it. How odd. Oh? What about this book? lol It's fine. It made me angry and nostalgic in turn. Mostly entirely because of the Boy Scouts. I remember survival training and then I remembered that the whole thing of the BOY SCOUTS is dead now. Survival training and survival literature have both died. I think that's kinda ironic."

Although this story is often on middle-school reading lists, amazingly, I've never read it myself, so I thought I better rectify this. Positives: 1. I could readily empathize with Brian's wonders, fears and accomplishments; 2. being from northern Canada myself, I was quite pleased when I correctly recognized the flora and fauna Brian encountered as food sources, such as his so-called \"gutberries\" (chokecherries), \"nutbushes\" (chestnut shrubs) and \"fool birds\" (ruffed grouse); and, 3. if read aloud or freely chosen for personal reading, I could easily see older primary and upper-elementary students enjoying this survival\/adventure story. Negatives: 1. phrasing was repetitive at times and could be distracting; and, 2. Brian's encounter with the skunk was quite the head-shaker for me - even a 6-year old wouldn't have done what Brian did! As far as survival stories involving young people go, I enjoyed this one much more than Where the Crawdads Sing , because it is more realistic\/believable to me, but the book Island of the Blue Dolphins by Scott O'Dell still tops my list!"

        "text":"Hatchet is a story about a young boy (Brian) struggling to survive after his plane crashes in a forest. He was traveling by airplane from the United States to Canada to see his father when the pilot suddenly had a heart attack. Brian lands the plane, but now he’s injured--and all alone with nothing but the hatchet his mother gave him. As Brian strives to find ways to survive, he learns and adapts to the new environment, but he faces many challenges with animals and the elements. Left to survive on his instincts and what he’s learned in the past, Brian ponders over his family situation and deals with many emotions. He’s a strong boy and becomes quite resourceful, but can he survive the Canadian wilderness? Gary Paulsen is one of my favorite authors, and it all started with this book, Hatchet . This book unequivocally is a favorite from childhood, and this is probably my third or fourth time reading it in my lifetime. This story never gets old. Brian is a relatable character, and what he’s going through feels real; in fact, this book reads like nonfiction, in my opinion. It’s adventurous, engrossing, and full of suspense. Not only that, it’s thought-provoking and makes you ask questions about what you'd do in a similar situation. How prepared would you be? Do you have what it takes to survive? What’s it like to be completely alone in the wilderness? It can make your imagination run wild, and maybe that’s just one of the reasons why kids enjoy this story so much. Readers who enjoy the outdoors or those who like survival stories will likely enjoy this book. This is a middle-grade book, but I’ve read it multiple times in adulthood and have enjoyed it all the same. Something I love about this story is Brian’s perseverance and how he learns from his mistakes. There are important lessons to learn. It’s a good story for boys, but girls will likely enjoy it too. The writing makes this a quick and easy read, but the book explores death, survival, divorce, anger, and even suicidal thoughts. Hatchet is a book I would personally recommend for young readers who struggle with reading or those who don't have an interest in reading. Definitely use your own discretion on whether your reader can handle these deeper themes though. Hatchet is book #1 in the Brian’s Saga series. I’ve read them all and will read them again and again. This is a series I’d recommend to anyone. The audio by Peter Coyote is amazing and perfectly sets the tone for this book. My kids enjoyed it along with their physical copies. 4.5-stars You can also see this review @readrantrockandroll.com"

        "text":"13-year-old Brian, a New York boy, boarded a private plane to the northern Canadian wilderness with a heavy secret. He was going to visit his father, who worked at an oil field. While he was happy to see his father, his secret weighed heavily on his heart. As he pondered his secret, the pilot suddenly suffered a heart attack and died. The sudden and shocking turn of events left him stunned. Realizing that crying wouldn't help, he forced himself to try and fly the plane. Somehow, he managed to land the plane in an unknown lake deep in the wilderness. Scrambling to safety, he realised his ordeal was far from over. Hunger, cold, swarms of mosquitoes, wild animals, and painful injuries were constant threats. Brian had no time to dwell on his secret; he had to survive. With only a hatchet, he was completely alone. He tried to recall all the survival skills he had learned, but practical application was much harder than he imagined. Desperate and defeated, Brian lay down and prepared to give up. But as he calmed down, he realized he had made a huge mistake. Knowledge and practice needed to be connected through thought and patience. Fear and death could be overcome with courage and confidence. And he hadn’t even truly tried. In this primitive wilderness, with no trace of modern civilization, Brian was the sole source of knowledge. He told himself he was his most valuable asset. In that moment, Brian was reborn. Brian gradually adapted to life in the wilderness and felt a sense of accomplishment he had never known before. He had endless tasks, new discoveries, and new goals. As this life became his norm, he began to miss his parents. He started to feel sorry for himself, questioning why he was so unlucky. But looking at his achievements, he realized that self-pity was pointless. Surviving was the greatest luck of all. He was grateful for the rising sun, the calm lake, and his delicious catches of fish and rabbit. However, Brian couldn't forget “the secret,” It was a secret about his parents' divorce that weighed heavily on him. If Brian taught us many life lessons, what should we as adults do? As parents, have we realized our responsibilities and obligations? But do we really have to be responsible for our children's lives? Life is full of hardships, and there are countless problems, worries, and unexpected accidents in the world. Should we tolerate, forgive, and compromise for the sake of others? A parent's love for their child is profound. This profound love means allowing children to develop independent personalities, equipping them to face various difficulties and life changes on their own, and preventing them from becoming self-destructive or losing their motivation due to temporary setbacks. A person's happiness and fulfillment are directly affected by whether their personality is complete and independent. Only when one is happy and fulfilled can they help and influence others. A truly independent and complete personality is characterized by a gradual detachment from dependence and a willingness to take responsibility for one's actions. Regardless of your marital status, teaching your children these things is a positive gift and a parental responsibility. We can leave our children money, houses, cars, and connections, which are valuable assets. However, teaching them how to use and manage these assets is the eternal way. Perhaps our children will never experience what Brian went through, but no one's life is perfect. In addition to material wealth, it is more important to provide spiritual guidance and support, and to help them apply the knowledge they have learned to practical situations as much as possible, then let them go. Teaching someone to fish can solve a lifetime of hunger. 3.4 \/ 5"

        "text":"I have to be honest. At first I was having a serious 'really?' moment as I started listening. The 'really?' was because this is a three-time Newberry Award winner, and I thought the prose was way too repetitive. The same word would be repeated three times. The same sentences twice. I was steeling myself to keep listening and hope it got better. It did. By the end of this novel, I totally realized why it is a Newberry Award winner. Hatchet is a story of survival. The protagonist is a thirteen-year-old city boy who ends up stranded in the Canadian wilderness when the pilot of the small plane he's flying in has a heart attack and dies. I have to tell you, I am very impressed with this kid. I think I would have freaked like nobody's business. He does freak out at first (and I don't blame him), but ultimately shows a fortitude that inspires awe in this reader. He goes from a scared, helpless boy to a survivor. The Brian that was has to be broken down and reassembled into a Brian that can survive his new reality. He learns how to meet his needs in the harsh wilderness, and he comes out of it forever changed. I love reading books\/watching tv shows and movies about surviving. I don't know why, really. I don't even go camping or hiking, although I love the outdoors. I think it's because I love the idea of a person being resourceful and pitting their skills and mentality against the unprejudiced, often unsympathetic wild. Not conquering it, but learning to live in harmony, becoming a part of a vast ecosystem in a way that we can't do stuck in our comfortable city and surburban environs, another entity in the web of life. I would definitely recommend this book if you are of a similar mind. I liked that Brian doesn't get it too easy. Not at all. He has to learn from his mistakes, and take the advantages that providence sends his way. He learns to keep food in his belly, to make a secure shelter, and to appreciate and anticipate the dangers of his environment. And in the process, he finds peace. He looks inside and finds his true self. That's what solitude and a oneness with nature will bring. I have always felt my most at peace in two places: in a spirit-filled church or by myself and with my heart open in prayer; and outside, surrounded by nature. So I really appreciated this aspect of the book. Brian starts out a boy who is emotionally lost at sea when his father and mother divorce, weighted down with the knowledge of his mother's infidelity; and finds that what seemed like tragedy and the end of his world will not conquer him. If he can survive the harsh elements of nature, all by himself, he can live with his family's fragmentation, and live to see the next day and the days after that. I think this book is a metaphor for life. Life is harsh and we have to grow and change to survive it. We can't give up, descend into pity, and expect to be saved. We have to be strong and fight to save ourselves, whether it's physically, mentally, or emotionally. Although this book had a very shaky start, I do have to agree that this is a winner. And I tell you what, this young man had a lot of lessons to teach me, lessons he learns the hard way. That's the power of a good fiction novel for me."

        "text":"Some books imprint themselves on your mind and stay with you. You can remember vividly where you were when you first read them. Hatchet is one of those books for me. I remember being in Mrs. Alison’s sixth grade class, and this book was raging though the male half of my class like a wildfire. Even boys who usually hated reading couldn’t put it down. Obviously, as the class’s self-proclaimed queen of the bookworms, I wanted to know what all the fuss was about. So, when a copy finally made it back to the book cubbies that lined the back of the classroom, I nabbed it. And I totally saw what the fuss was about. Survival stories have been popular for centuries. Robinson Crusoe, Kidnapped, The Swiss Family Robinson; even The Odyssey had survival aspects. So what was so special about Hatchet? It was the story of a thirteen-year-old plane-crash victim struggling to survive in the Canadian wilderness. Alone. With nothing but his hatchet. This was a main character who was close to our age. Who was struggling to accept the recent divorce of his parents, which was something that multiple kids in our class were going through, and that the rest of us feared. Who had absolutely none of the knowledge and skills seemingly necessary to make it in the wild. Like the rest of us. Seriously, what middle school kid would actually know what to do if they were dropped in the woods, alone, with no supplies and no tools except for a hatchet? If we’re honest, most of us as adults would have no clue what to do, either. One thing about kids, though; they don’t know enough yet to doubt their ability to survive anything. Kids believe that death doesn’t apply to them, and in some ways that’s the only way one could survive this type of dire situation. And survive Brian does. But Paulsen doesn’t pull punches; this is not a romanticized survival story, where food falls in the protagonist’s lap and they never get so much as a blister. Brian gets put through the wringer. This poor child get severely sunburned, violently ill from bad fruit, attacked by various forest dwellers, and more. Not to mention the near starvation he is constantly battling. As a twelve-year-old, this book was terrifying and empowering and completely enthralling. I’ve read it six more times since then, and it’s still all of those things, with a healthy dose of nostalgia thrown in. So thanks, boys in my class, for getting me interested. If you’re a parent, you should definitely get this book for your kids. If you’re still a kid at heart and have never read this, track down a copy. You never know; the things you learn from this book could save your life if you ever get stranded alone in the middle of a forest."

If my kids decide to try this one out, I will be there for them if they have any questions about it. Should you read this book?

        "text":"Despite some of the repetition getting annoying from time to time, Hatchet is an engrossing story of survival for a young boy unfortunate enough to endure a plane crash to become stranded in the Canadian wilderness. For the most part the story sticks to realistic stuff, concentrating mainly on hunger and food. So many other survival stories focus on more, but really the basics of food and hunger and survival would be the forefront issue most would encounter if stranded alone. It sets in fast and it's almost constant. Brian shows he has what it takes to survive, but the author doesn't make the child come across as anything super since he shows that nature is uncontrollable and that it's luck of the draw for us all. The author even ends the narrative of the story saying that if Brian had been unlucky enough to be stranded during wintertime in the Canadian wilderness, he very likely wouldn't have survived at all. His dependency on the lake is the only reason he made it past the first few days, and then subsequent months, but a frozen lake would have nixed that. Although realistic with its focus on hunger and survival, it did have an unlikely tornado that felt contrived. Still the story can be forgiven this, as it focused on things like swarms of mosquitoes, baking sun, a random rude moose and other concerns. Brian didn't venture far from the landing, and I'm not sure I would have either. Some would venture far to try and find salvation themselves but he stuck to one area and stayed close to the shelter and food\/water supply that were guaranteed to be sure. A more cautious method that worked. Not sure what I would have done in his circumstances, but I see the point that the chances of shelter like that would have been few and far between. Written for children, it's more interesting and educational than upsetting. I do wish the author had spent more time granting us a deeper afterword. I realize the point of the story was the struggle, but I like to see more time involved with the after effect. Just a pet peeve of mine. We did get a small one at least. Besides the survival story being the focus, the Secret also weighed heavy in his mind, and ends up being a continuous thing he has to carry. The story ties into the Hatchet being the main tool he used to get started, but I do have to wonder why kind of random present that is that a mother gives a young boy. Either way, came in handy. Even if the repetition with the writer's style grew too much at times, it was to the point and paced well. I can see why it won so many children's awards, including Newberry Honor."

She read it to us right before first recess, so whenever that day's chapter ended with a cliffhanger we had the whole recess to discuss what we thought was going to happen next (and act out our own renditions of the time Brian got attacked by a bear)."

        "text":"I.love.this.book. Seriously, I read this maybe in fourth grade? It was definitly in elementary school, because I remember it was at the same time that we we doing \"survival skills\"* in Girl Scouts. Not that I ever wanted to be trapped by myself in the wilderness, but I spent a lot of my time in my backyard pretending to find flint with my sister, and starting imaginary fires to keep warm. In winter we dug ourselves igloos. I always went camping with my parents, so this book started a lot of Q&A's with them about what to do if I get lost in the woods (Hint, No. 1 is STAY WHERE YOU ARE!). Any ways, its a great read for an elementary kid, and everyone should read it. * This was put in quotation marks because it was a total joke. I had been looking forward to these skills for quite some time, finally girl scouts was going to teach me what I wanted! Instead of knives they handed us popsicle sticks. For the love of God CUB SCOUTS get real knives. This was followed shortly on the heels of an outdoor cooking class where none of us were allowed near the fire. Basically we made banana boats, and then the instructor put the boats in and out of the coals for us. We learned how to build a fire with coals, not tinder. Agh. It was at this point that I decided Girl Scouts was NOT for me."

I love survival stories, children without adult stories, this is quite a tough story, I err on the survival stories where you have some sort of home created, some comforting details, much appreciated because of the hardship. Brian certainly had a lot of hardship and how ironic that when he finds after 2 months of hell, a survival pack from the crash with a sleeping bag, gun, cooking stuff and copious amounts of dried food, a plane lands to rescue him before he's even had a spoonful! We began to find it amusing just how unlucky Brian managed to be! And phew! noticing this was a series of books we wondered if he would get rescued! But luckily for Brian he does! The cover on this book is a perfect example of an illustrator not reading the story, again and again we are told how Brian is weather beaten and sunburnt to a crisp, and yet the cover picture makes me think of a 1980s new romantic look complete with black eyeliner!

        "text":"So when I added this, I vaguely recalled the title, and I swear, I have definitely read it, but what I thought it was about was a boy being stuck under the snow following an avalanche (it turns out the book I was thinking of is apty named Avalanche by Arthur Roth) but anyway, that's not what it is about, and I really don't remember this book at all. Hatchet I definitely read in middle school at the instruction of my librarian (we had a sort of once-weekly class in the library to introduce us to the already anachronistic card catalog, and maybe to encourage us to read). It strikes me now as one of those \"boy books\" and was sort of offered to me as an alternative to Babysitters' Club or Nancy Drew, maybe. It's strange now, because it undervalues literature very much to say that some is suited to boys, and others to girls (which is to say nothing of our society's pathetic need to classify and categorize). Based on my vague and unreliable memory (and the description gleaned from amazon), here are the reasons why you should have your son, nephew, homeless male orphan read Hatchet : 1) It is the story about a boy named Brian. Brian is a great boy name (maybe you've considered it for your tot?), and everything he does (probably) exudes the same brand of outdoorsy masculinity that you want your little Timmy, Tommy or Teddy to adopt as an adolescent and adult. 2) It takes place outside. What better way to encourage kids to go outside than to have them sit inside and read a book about a boy who is outside? 3) There is a hatchet, presumably. Whether little Johnny has that lumberjack vibe, or that investment banker gone Sarsgaard-murder-house vibe, certainly it will be important to introduce them to the concept of the hatchet. A very useful tool that almost no one uses, as far as I know. 4) The plot evidently features a plane crash, wherein Brian must be the lone survivor. Very likely to happen. Also, surely all the characters in this book are male, what better way to introduce your young one to a realistic view of the world than to immerse them in world dominated completely by a young boy and some owls, or something. (also see: Lord of the Flies ) 5. This 20th anniversary edition features a great commentary by the author, Gary Paulson. Even though your little brat probably won't read this (why would he?), it will give his ego the small boost for the illusion of having read a book a little longer than he actually did). 6. This is the first installation of a SAGA. For one, \"saga\" is reminiscent to me of the Nordic mythos, which seems to be the most supporting of the idealized male image. It also means there are multiple volumes following our intrepid Brian. What more could you want? Why invest in Boy Scouts when you could drop a pile of Brian books in your kid's lap and turn him into a man, while saving all that time and money? Get it! So good!"

Looking back, I can't quite remember what it was I disliked about it so much. I can only guess it was because I was a huge reader even then, but I hated being told what to read; it also took time away from my other books. Reading it again, 10 years later (and again at least once a year since) it has become one of my favorites, quite possibly in my top 10. I also recommend the sequels, particularly Brian's Winter which is great for those of us who ask what-if? at the end of a much loved book."

The first thing Brain did after he crashed was he panicked, he felt lost, and he missed his family. The author described other emotions Brian felt when he was alone in the forest like hopelessness, desperation, and hunger. Every time the author expressed a feeling, it would always paint a realistic picture in my head, sometimes sending chills down my spine. I wondered “If I was in that situation, what would I do?” Although I think I would lose hope in these situations, I will get myself together and try my best to keep my self from negative emotions and hunger. It's in human nature to have a strong desire to survive. Reading this book reminded me of the movie \"The life of Pi.\" Surviving on a boat with a tiger for 227 days?! I would rather drown myself. What made Pi survive was faith. When you have faith, you have hope. When you have hope, you can see the light at the end of the tunnel. That's what motivates you to overcome difficulties and achieve your dream. Faith is what made me get up 6 o'clock in the morning to attend swimming lessons. I am still young, there will be a lot of difficulties I will be facing in my life, but I think as long as I have faith in myself, I believe I can overcome a lot of challenges and achieve my dreams."

The reason as well as the divorce itself are eating away at Brian. That is until his pilot has a heart attack and he crashes in the middle of the Canadian wilderness and has to get creative in order to survive. The book is relatively minimalist, but that in no way makes it less good. It's the story of a boy and nature and the unbreakable spirit of some people. I wish this kind of survivalist story was (still) more popular. Because neither children nor adults are generally this knowledgeable about nature anymore. Most just stand around and scream whenever anything happens. Yes, I'm one of the kids who spent a lot of time outside. I watched TV, I got a computer as a teen, my parents weren't some hippies, but I was also outside a lot and learned about making fire and finding shelter, knowing what to eat and what not when in a forest. I have colleages 10 years my senior who didn't even realize that the \"large chicken breasts\" their butcher often has aren't chicken breasts but turkey breasts and that those are two very different animals. *rolls eyes* So I really enjoyed the can-do spirit, the learning curve (that the boy was neither hysterical nor unrealistically faultless in his actions), the progression of the time spent in the wild, the Boy Scout feel of it all. I can see why so many have read this book, often in school, in the past; and why a lot of kids might dig this. It wasn't perfect, but it was a pretty neat adventure with high stakes that teaches the reader a lot about mental attitude and fortitude."

I started reading it and said, \"Damn, I hate it when authors use this kind of tone for kids, emphasizing 'secret' so damn much in extremely short and supposedly powerful ways that just sounds so faux-mysterious.\" A second later it dawned on me that I knew the rest of the story. Another second later, I realized it wasn't because the survival trope was so damn common. It was because I HAD read it and just plain forgot it. Huh. Well, anyway, it made me think about how survival tropes haven't really been around anymore. I mean, sure, we have Hunger Games and just about every Anime out there, but there's not too much in modern lit, not that I've seen. Notable examples to the contrary are Life of Pi, etc., but many of these serve as either satire or dark commentary. Whatever happened to this kind of genre, especially SF? Heinlein's juveniles used to be full of it. How odd. Oh? What about this book? lol It's fine. It made me angry and nostalgic in turn. Mostly entirely because of the Boy Scouts. I remember survival training and then I remembered that the whole thing of the BOY SCOUTS is dead now. Survival training and survival literature have both died. I think that's kinda ironic."

And, having just been marooned in a plane crash, you could lack the proper facilities to expel the diarrhea within. So, you could end up shitting your brains out in a cave.

Although this story is often on middle-school reading lists, amazingly, I've never read it myself, so I thought I better rectify this. Positives: 1. I could readily empathize with Brian's wonders, fears and accomplishments; 2. being from northern Canada myself, I was quite pleased when I correctly recognized the flora and fauna Brian encountered as food sources, such as his so-called \"gutberries\" (chokecherries), \"nutbushes\" (chestnut shrubs) and \"fool birds\" (ruffed grouse); and, 3. if read aloud or freely chosen for personal reading, I could easily see older primary and upper-elementary students enjoying this survival\/adventure story. Negatives: 1. phrasing was repetitive at times and could be distracting; and, 2. Brian's encounter with the skunk was quite the head-shaker for me - even a 6-year old wouldn't have done what Brian did! As far as survival stories involving young people go, I enjoyed this one much more than Where the Crawdads Sing , because it is more realistic\/believable to me, but the book Island of the Blue Dolphins by Scott O'Dell still tops my list!"

        "text":"Hatchet is a story about a young boy (Brian) struggling to survive after his plane crashes in a forest. He was traveling by airplane from the United States to Canada to see his father when the pilot suddenly had a heart attack. Brian lands the plane, but now he’s injured--and all alone with nothing but the hatchet his mother gave him. As Brian strives to find ways to survive, he learns and adapts to the new environment, but he faces many challenges with animals and the elements. Left to survive on his instincts and what he’s learned in the past, Brian ponders over his family situation and deals with many emotions. He’s a strong boy and becomes quite resourceful, but can he survive the Canadian wilderness? Gary Paulsen is one of my favorite authors, and it all started with this book, Hatchet . This book unequivocally is a favorite from childhood, and this is probably my third or fourth time reading it in my lifetime. This story never gets old. Brian is a relatable character, and what he’s going through feels real; in fact, this book reads like nonfiction, in my opinion. It’s adventurous, engrossing, and full of suspense. Not only that, it’s thought-provoking and makes you ask questions about what you'd do in a similar situation. How prepared would you be? Do you have what it takes to survive? What’s it like to be completely alone in the wilderness? It can make your imagination run wild, and maybe that’s just one of the reasons why kids enjoy this story so much. Readers who enjoy the outdoors or those who like survival stories will likely enjoy this book. This is a middle-grade book, but I’ve read it multiple times in adulthood and have enjoyed it all the same. Something I love about this story is Brian’s perseverance and how he learns from his mistakes. There are important lessons to learn. It’s a good story for boys, but girls will likely enjoy it too. The writing makes this a quick and easy read, but the book explores death, survival, divorce, anger, and even suicidal thoughts. Hatchet is a book I would personally recommend for young readers who struggle with reading or those who don't have an interest in reading. Definitely use your own discretion on whether your reader can handle these deeper themes though. Hatchet is book #1 in the Brian’s Saga series. I’ve read them all and will read them again and again. This is a series I’d recommend to anyone. The audio by Peter Coyote is amazing and perfectly sets the tone for this book. My kids enjoyed it along with their physical copies. 4.5-stars You can also see this review @readrantrockandroll.com"

        "text":"13-year-old Brian, a New York boy, boarded a private plane to the northern Canadian wilderness with a heavy secret. He was going to visit his father, who worked at an oil field. While he was happy to see his father, his secret weighed heavily on his heart. As he pondered his secret, the pilot suddenly suffered a heart attack and died. The sudden and shocking turn of events left him stunned. Realizing that crying wouldn't help, he forced himself to try and fly the plane. Somehow, he managed to land the plane in an unknown lake deep in the wilderness. Scrambling to safety, he realised his ordeal was far from over. Hunger, cold, swarms of mosquitoes, wild animals, and painful injuries were constant threats. Brian had no time to dwell on his secret; he had to survive. With only a hatchet, he was completely alone. He tried to recall all the survival skills he had learned, but practical application was much harder than he imagined. Desperate and defeated, Brian lay down and prepared to give up. But as he calmed down, he realized he had made a huge mistake. Knowledge and practice needed to be connected through thought and patience. Fear and death could be overcome with courage and confidence. And he hadn’t even truly tried. In this primitive wilderness, with no trace of modern civilization, Brian was the sole source of knowledge. He told himself he was his most valuable asset. In that moment, Brian was reborn. Brian gradually adapted to life in the wilderness and felt a sense of accomplishment he had never known before. He had endless tasks, new discoveries, and new goals. As this life became his norm, he began to miss his parents. He started to feel sorry for himself, questioning why he was so unlucky. But looking at his achievements, he realized that self-pity was pointless. Surviving was the greatest luck of all. He was grateful for the rising sun, the calm lake, and his delicious catches of fish and rabbit. However, Brian couldn't forget “the secret,” It was a secret about his parents' divorce that weighed heavily on him. If Brian taught us many life lessons, what should we as adults do? As parents, have we realized our responsibilities and obligations? But do we really have to be responsible for our children's lives? Life is full of hardships, and there are countless problems, worries, and unexpected accidents in the world. Should we tolerate, forgive, and compromise for the sake of others? A parent's love for their child is profound. This profound love means allowing children to develop independent personalities, equipping them to face various difficulties and life changes on their own, and preventing them from becoming self-destructive or losing their motivation due to temporary setbacks. A person's happiness and fulfillment are directly affected by whether their personality is complete and independent. Only when one is happy and fulfilled can they help and influence others. A truly independent and complete personality is characterized by a gradual detachment from dependence and a willingness to take responsibility for one's actions. Regardless of your marital status, teaching your children these things is a positive gift and a parental responsibility. We can leave our children money, houses, cars, and connections, which are valuable assets. However, teaching them how to use and manage these assets is the eternal way. Perhaps our children will never experience what Brian went through, but no one's life is perfect. In addition to material wealth, it is more important to provide spiritual guidance and support, and to help them apply the knowledge they have learned to practical situations as much as possible, then let them go. Teaching someone to fish can solve a lifetime of hunger. 3.4 \/ 5"

        "text":"I have to be honest. At first I was having a serious 'really?' moment as I started listening. The 'really?' was because this is a three-time Newberry Award winner, and I thought the prose was way too repetitive. The same word would be repeated three times. The same sentences twice. I was steeling myself to keep listening and hope it got better. It did. By the end of this novel, I totally realized why it is a Newberry Award winner. Hatchet is a story of survival. The protagonist is a thirteen-year-old city boy who ends up stranded in the Canadian wilderness when the pilot of the small plane he's flying in has a heart attack and dies. I have to tell you, I am very impressed with this kid. I think I would have freaked like nobody's business. He does freak out at first (and I don't blame him), but ultimately shows a fortitude that inspires awe in this reader. He goes from a scared, helpless boy to a survivor. The Brian that was has to be broken down and reassembled into a Brian that can survive his new reality. He learns how to meet his needs in the harsh wilderness, and he comes out of it forever changed. I love reading books\/watching tv shows and movies about surviving. I don't know why, really. I don't even go camping or hiking, although I love the outdoors. I think it's because I love the idea of a person being resourceful and pitting their skills and mentality against the unprejudiced, often unsympathetic wild. Not conquering it, but learning to live in harmony, becoming a part of a vast ecosystem in a way that we can't do stuck in our comfortable city and surburban environs, another entity in the web of life. I would definitely recommend this book if you are of a similar mind. I liked that Brian doesn't get it too easy. Not at all. He has to learn from his mistakes, and take the advantages that providence sends his way. He learns to keep food in his belly, to make a secure shelter, and to appreciate and anticipate the dangers of his environment. And in the process, he finds peace. He looks inside and finds his true self. That's what solitude and a oneness with nature will bring. I have always felt my most at peace in two places: in a spirit-filled church or by myself and with my heart open in prayer; and outside, surrounded by nature. So I really appreciated this aspect of the book. Brian starts out a boy who is emotionally lost at sea when his father and mother divorce, weighted down with the knowledge of his mother's infidelity; and finds that what seemed like tragedy and the end of his world will not conquer him. If he can survive the harsh elements of nature, all by himself, he can live with his family's fragmentation, and live to see the next day and the days after that. I think this book is a metaphor for life. Life is harsh and we have to grow and change to survive it. We can't give up, descend into pity, and expect to be saved. We have to be strong and fight to save ourselves, whether it's physically, mentally, or emotionally. Although this book had a very shaky start, I do have to agree that this is a winner. And I tell you what, this young man had a lot of lessons to teach me, lessons he learns the hard way. That's the power of a good fiction novel for me."

        "text":"Some books imprint themselves on your mind and stay with you. You can remember vividly where you were when you first read them. Hatchet is one of those books for me. I remember being in Mrs. Alison’s sixth grade class, and this book was raging though the male half of my class like a wildfire. Even boys who usually hated reading couldn’t put it down. Obviously, as the class’s self-proclaimed queen of the bookworms, I wanted to know what all the fuss was about. So, when a copy finally made it back to the book cubbies that lined the back of the classroom, I nabbed it. And I totally saw what the fuss was about. Survival stories have been popular for centuries. Robinson Crusoe, Kidnapped, The Swiss Family Robinson; even The Odyssey had survival aspects. So what was so special about Hatchet? It was the story of a thirteen-year-old plane-crash victim struggling to survive in the Canadian wilderness. Alone. With nothing but his hatchet. This was a main character who was close to our age. Who was struggling to accept the recent divorce of his parents, which was something that multiple kids in our class were going through, and that the rest of us feared. Who had absolutely none of the knowledge and skills seemingly necessary to make it in the wild. Like the rest of us. Seriously, what middle school kid would actually know what to do if they were dropped in the woods, alone, with no supplies and no tools except for a hatchet? If we’re honest, most of us as adults would have no clue what to do, either. One thing about kids, though; they don’t know enough yet to doubt their ability to survive anything. Kids believe that death doesn’t apply to them, and in some ways that’s the only way one could survive this type of dire situation. And survive Brian does. But Paulsen doesn’t pull punches; this is not a romanticized survival story, where food falls in the protagonist’s lap and they never get so much as a blister. Brian gets put through the wringer. This poor child get severely sunburned, violently ill from bad fruit, attacked by various forest dwellers, and more. Not to mention the near starvation he is constantly battling. As a twelve-year-old, this book was terrifying and empowering and completely enthralling. I’ve read it six more times since then, and it’s still all of those things, with a healthy dose of nostalgia thrown in. So thanks, boys in my class, for getting me interested. If you’re a parent, you should definitely get this book for your kids. If you’re still a kid at heart and have never read this, track down a copy. You never know; the things you learn from this book could save your life if you ever get stranded alone in the middle of a forest."

I love it when I am searching for an audiobook and books like this pop up as available. I think, “Ah ha! I can finally get to this one!” It did not take me long to get through Hatchet during my daily lunchtime walks. It held my interest throughout, but probably wasn’t even long enough to lose it! It is definitely geared toward pre and early teens – however, there are a couple of more difficult topics (like death and survival) that this might be a kids first introduction to (unless they are like me and started reading Stephen King at 12!) If my kids decide to try this one out, I will be there for them if they have any questions about it. Should you read this book? It is not bad for a quick read, but it may prove to be too simple for some peoples’ tastes. If you can adjust your mindset and think of it like a 10- to 13-year-old would, I think you will appreciate it more.

Brian has to survive in the Canadian Woods on his own for a summer. He learns to make fire, shelter and hunt for fish and birds. There is also a divorce theme going on as Brian's parents have recently split. This is your typical survival tale. Brian does face some harsh environments and he learns to be tough physically and more importantly - mentally. He doesn't give in to feeling sorry for himself.

        "text":"Despite some of the repetition getting annoying from time to time, Hatchet is an engrossing story of survival for a young boy unfortunate enough to endure a plane crash to become stranded in the Canadian wilderness. For the most part the story sticks to realistic stuff, concentrating mainly on hunger and food. So many other survival stories focus on more, but really the basics of food and hunger and survival would be the forefront issue most would encounter if stranded alone. It sets in fast and it's almost constant. Brian shows he has what it takes to survive, but the author doesn't make the child come across as anything super since he shows that nature is uncontrollable and that it's luck of the draw for us all. The author even ends the narrative of the story saying that if Brian had been unlucky enough to be stranded during wintertime in the Canadian wilderness, he very likely wouldn't have survived at all. His dependency on the lake is the only reason he made it past the first few days, and then subsequent months, but a frozen lake would have nixed that. Although realistic with its focus on hunger and survival, it did have an unlikely tornado that felt contrived. Still the story can be forgiven this, as it focused on things like swarms of mosquitoes, baking sun, a random rude moose and other concerns. Brian didn't venture far from the landing, and I'm not sure I would have either. Some would venture far to try and find salvation themselves but he stuck to one area and stayed close to the shelter and food\/water supply that were guaranteed to be sure. A more cautious method that worked. Not sure what I would have done in his circumstances, but I see the point that the chances of shelter like that would have been few and far between. Written for children, it's more interesting and educational than upsetting. I do wish the author had spent more time granting us a deeper afterword. I realize the point of the story was the struggle, but I like to see more time involved with the after effect. Just a pet peeve of mine. We did get a small one at least. Besides the survival story being the focus, the Secret also weighed heavy in his mind, and ends up being a continuous thing he has to carry. The story ties into the Hatchet being the main tool he used to get started, but I do have to wonder why kind of random present that is that a mother gives a young boy. Either way, came in handy. Even if the repetition with the writer's style grew too much at times, it was to the point and paced well. I can see why it won so many children's awards, including Newberry Honor."

For the love of God CUB SCOUTS get real knives. This was followed shortly on the heels of an outdoor cooking class where none of us were allowed near the fire.

Hatchet I definitely read in middle school at the instruction of my librarian (we had a sort of once-weekly class in the library to introduce us to the already anachronistic card catalog, and maybe to encourage us to read). It strikes me now as one of those \"boy books\" and was sort of offered to me as an alternative to Babysitters' Club or Nancy Drew, maybe. It's strange now, because it undervalues literature very much to say that some is suited to boys, and others to girls (which is to say nothing of our society's pathetic need to classify and categorize). Based on my vague and unreliable memory (and the description gleaned from amazon), here are the reasons why you should have your son, nephew, homeless male orphan read Hatchet : 1) It is the story about a boy named Brian. Brian is a great boy name (maybe you've considered it for your tot?), and everything he does (probably) exudes the same brand of outdoorsy masculinity that you want your little Timmy, Tommy or Teddy to adopt as an adolescent and adult. 2) It takes place outside. What better way to encourage kids to go outside than to have them sit inside and read a book about a boy who is outside? 3) There is a hatchet, presumably. Whether little Johnny has that lumberjack vibe, or that investment banker gone Sarsgaard-murder-house vibe, certainly it will be important to introduce them to the concept of the hatchet. A very useful tool that almost no one uses, as far as I know. 4) The plot evidently features a plane crash, wherein Brian must be the lone survivor. Very likely to happen. Also, surely all the characters in this book are male, what better way to introduce your young one to a realistic view of the world than to immerse them in world dominated completely by a young boy and some owls, or something. (also see: Lord of the Flies ) 5. This 20th anniversary edition features a great commentary by the author, Gary Paulson. Even though your little brat probably won't read this (why would he?), it will give his ego the small boost for the illusion of having read a book a little longer than he actually did). 6. This is the first installation of a SAGA. For one, \"saga\" is reminiscent to me of the Nordic mythos, which seems to be the most supporting of the idealized male image. It also means there are multiple volumes following our intrepid Brian. What more could you want? Why invest in Boy Scouts when you could drop a pile of Brian books in your kid's lap and turn him into a man, while saving all that time and money? Get it! So good!"

I wondered “If I was in that situation, what would I do?” Although I think I would lose hope in these situations, I will get myself together and try my best to keep my self from negative emotions and hunger. It's in human nature to have a strong desire to survive. Reading this book reminded me of the movie \"The life of Pi.\" Surviving on a boat with a tiger for 227 days?! I would rather drown myself. What made Pi survive was faith. When you have faith, you have hope. When you have hope, you can see the light at the end of the tunnel. That's what motivates you to overcome difficulties and achieve your dream. Faith is what made me get up 6 o'clock in the morning to attend swimming lessons.

The book is relatively minimalist, but that in no way makes it less good. It's the story of a boy and nature and the unbreakable spirit of some people. I wish this kind of survivalist story was (still) more popular. Because neither children nor adults are generally this knowledgeable about nature anymore. Most just stand around and scream whenever anything happens. Yes, I'm one of the kids who spent a lot of time outside. I watched TV, I got a computer as a teen, my parents weren't some hippies, but I was also outside a lot and learned about making fire and finding shelter, knowing what to eat and what not when in a forest. I have colleages 10 years my senior who didn't even realize that the \"large chicken breasts\" their butcher often has aren't chicken breasts but turkey breasts and that those are two very different animals. *rolls eyes* So I really enjoyed the can-do spirit, the learning curve (that the boy was neither hysterical nor unrealistically faultless in his actions), the progression of the time spent in the wild, the Boy Scout feel of it all. I can see why so many have read this book, often in school, in the past; and why a lot of kids might dig this.

I mean, sure, we have Hunger Games and just about every Anime out there, but there's not too much in modern lit, not that I've seen.

We don't really read much about Brian as a person. Even his secret could have been more human and not that flat. Still it gets 4 points because I did enjoy it. This book is in the 1001 Children's Books You Must Read Before You Grow Up challenge I am doing."

Someone may want to tell him that there are other ways to provoke a response in a reader than going right for the gut, so to speak. This book could have done with some fear and suspense, perhaps some gratification, depression, or joy. I do not mind a tragedy, nor do I balk at watching the man beaten down. I am a fan of Chekhov's.

If this man is the pilot of a charter prop plane that you're flying alone in, you could be fucked. 2. If you eat mysterious berries, they just might give you severe diarrhea. And, having just been marooned in a plane crash, you could lack the proper facilities to expel the diarrhea within. So, you could end up shitting your brains out in a cave.

Although this story is often on middle-school reading lists, amazingly, I've never read it myself, so I thought I better rectify this. Positives: 1. I could readily empathize with Brian's wonders, fears and accomplishments; 2. being from northern Canada myself, I was quite pleased when I correctly recognized the flora and fauna Brian encountered as food sources, such as his so-called \"gutberries\" (chokecherries), \"nutbushes\" (chestnut shrubs) and \"fool birds\" (ruffed grouse); and, 3. if read aloud or freely chosen for personal reading, I could easily see older primary and upper-elementary students enjoying this survival\/adventure story. Negatives: 1. phrasing was repetitive at times and could be distracting; and, 2. Brian's encounter with the skunk was quite the head-shaker for me - even a 6-year old wouldn't have done what Brian did! As far as survival stories involving young people go, I enjoyed this one much more than Where the Crawdads Sing , because it is more realistic\/believable to me, but the book Island of the Blue Dolphins by Scott O'Dell still tops my list!"

        "text":"Hatchet is a story about a young boy (Brian) struggling to survive after his plane crashes in a forest. He was traveling by airplane from the United States to Canada to see his father when the pilot suddenly had a heart attack. Brian lands the plane, but now he’s injured--and all alone with nothing but the hatchet his mother gave him. As Brian strives to find ways to survive, he learns and adapts to the new environment, but he faces many challenges with animals and the elements. Left to survive on his instincts and what he’s learned in the past, Brian ponders over his family situation and deals with many emotions. He’s a strong boy and becomes quite resourceful, but can he survive the Canadian wilderness? Gary Paulsen is one of my favorite authors, and it all started with this book, Hatchet . This book unequivocally is a favorite from childhood, and this is probably my third or fourth time reading it in my lifetime. This story never gets old. Brian is a relatable character, and what he’s going through feels real; in fact, this book reads like nonfiction, in my opinion. It’s adventurous, engrossing, and full of suspense. Not only that, it’s thought-provoking and makes you ask questions about what you'd do in a similar situation. How prepared would you be? Do you have what it takes to survive? What’s it like to be completely alone in the wilderness? It can make your imagination run wild, and maybe that’s just one of the reasons why kids enjoy this story so much. Readers who enjoy the outdoors or those who like survival stories will likely enjoy this book. This is a middle-grade book, but I’ve read it multiple times in adulthood and have enjoyed it all the same. Something I love about this story is Brian’s perseverance and how he learns from his mistakes. There are important lessons to learn. It’s a good story for boys, but girls will likely enjoy it too. The writing makes this a quick and easy read, but the book explores death, survival, divorce, anger, and even suicidal thoughts. Hatchet is a book I would personally recommend for young readers who struggle with reading or those who don't have an interest in reading. Definitely use your own discretion on whether your reader can handle these deeper themes though. Hatchet is book #1 in the Brian’s Saga series. I’ve read them all and will read them again and again. This is a series I’d recommend to anyone. The audio by Peter Coyote is amazing and perfectly sets the tone for this book. My kids enjoyed it along with their physical copies. 4.5-stars You can also see this review @readrantrockandroll.com"

        "text":"13-year-old Brian, a New York boy, boarded a private plane to the northern Canadian wilderness with a heavy secret. He was going to visit his father, who worked at an oil field. While he was happy to see his father, his secret weighed heavily on his heart. As he pondered his secret, the pilot suddenly suffered a heart attack and died. The sudden and shocking turn of events left him stunned. Realizing that crying wouldn't help, he forced himself to try and fly the plane. Somehow, he managed to land the plane in an unknown lake deep in the wilderness. Scrambling to safety, he realised his ordeal was far from over. Hunger, cold, swarms of mosquitoes, wild animals, and painful injuries were constant threats. Brian had no time to dwell on his secret; he had to survive. With only a hatchet, he was completely alone. He tried to recall all the survival skills he had learned, but practical application was much harder than he imagined. Desperate and defeated, Brian lay down and prepared to give up. But as he calmed down, he realized he had made a huge mistake. Knowledge and practice needed to be connected through thought and patience. Fear and death could be overcome with courage and confidence. And he hadn’t even truly tried. In this primitive wilderness, with no trace of modern civilization, Brian was the sole source of knowledge. He told himself he was his most valuable asset. In that moment, Brian was reborn. Brian gradually adapted to life in the wilderness and felt a sense of accomplishment he had never known before. He had endless tasks, new discoveries, and new goals. As this life became his norm, he began to miss his parents. He started to feel sorry for himself, questioning why he was so unlucky. But looking at his achievements, he realized that self-pity was pointless. Surviving was the greatest luck of all. He was grateful for the rising sun, the calm lake, and his delicious catches of fish and rabbit. However, Brian couldn't forget “the secret,” It was a secret about his parents' divorce that weighed heavily on him. If Brian taught us many life lessons, what should we as adults do? As parents, have we realized our responsibilities and obligations? But do we really have to be responsible for our children's lives? Life is full of hardships, and there are countless problems, worries, and unexpected accidents in the world. Should we tolerate, forgive, and compromise for the sake of others? A parent's love for their child is profound. This profound love means allowing children to develop independent personalities, equipping them to face various difficulties and life changes on their own, and preventing them from becoming self-destructive or losing their motivation due to temporary setbacks. A person's happiness and fulfillment are directly affected by whether their personality is complete and independent. Only when one is happy and fulfilled can they help and influence others. A truly independent and complete personality is characterized by a gradual detachment from dependence and a willingness to take responsibility for one's actions. Regardless of your marital status, teaching your children these things is a positive gift and a parental responsibility. We can leave our children money, houses, cars, and connections, which are valuable assets. However, teaching them how to use and manage these assets is the eternal way. Perhaps our children will never experience what Brian went through, but no one's life is perfect. In addition to material wealth, it is more important to provide spiritual guidance and support, and to help them apply the knowledge they have learned to practical situations as much as possible, then let them go. Teaching someone to fish can solve a lifetime of hunger. 3.4 \/ 5"

        "text":"I have to be honest. At first I was having a serious 'really?' moment as I started listening. The 'really?' was because this is a three-time Newberry Award winner, and I thought the prose was way too repetitive. The same word would be repeated three times. The same sentences twice. I was steeling myself to keep listening and hope it got better. It did. By the end of this novel, I totally realized why it is a Newberry Award winner. Hatchet is a story of survival. The protagonist is a thirteen-year-old city boy who ends up stranded in the Canadian wilderness when the pilot of the small plane he's flying in has a heart attack and dies. I have to tell you, I am very impressed with this kid. I think I would have freaked like nobody's business. He does freak out at first (and I don't blame him), but ultimately shows a fortitude that inspires awe in this reader. He goes from a scared, helpless boy to a survivor. The Brian that was has to be broken down and reassembled into a Brian that can survive his new reality. He learns how to meet his needs in the harsh wilderness, and he comes out of it forever changed. I love reading books\/watching tv shows and movies about surviving. I don't know why, really. I don't even go camping or hiking, although I love the outdoors. I think it's because I love the idea of a person being resourceful and pitting their skills and mentality against the unprejudiced, often unsympathetic wild. Not conquering it, but learning to live in harmony, becoming a part of a vast ecosystem in a way that we can't do stuck in our comfortable city and surburban environs, another entity in the web of life. I would definitely recommend this book if you are of a similar mind. I liked that Brian doesn't get it too easy. Not at all. He has to learn from his mistakes, and take the advantages that providence sends his way. He learns to keep food in his belly, to make a secure shelter, and to appreciate and anticipate the dangers of his environment. And in the process, he finds peace. He looks inside and finds his true self. That's what solitude and a oneness with nature will bring. I have always felt my most at peace in two places: in a spirit-filled church or by myself and with my heart open in prayer; and outside, surrounded by nature. So I really appreciated this aspect of the book. Brian starts out a boy who is emotionally lost at sea when his father and mother divorce, weighted down with the knowledge of his mother's infidelity; and finds that what seemed like tragedy and the end of his world will not conquer him. If he can survive the harsh elements of nature, all by himself, he can live with his family's fragmentation, and live to see the next day and the days after that. I think this book is a metaphor for life. Life is harsh and we have to grow and change to survive it. We can't give up, descend into pity, and expect to be saved. We have to be strong and fight to save ourselves, whether it's physically, mentally, or emotionally. Although this book had a very shaky start, I do have to agree that this is a winner. And I tell you what, this young man had a lot of lessons to teach me, lessons he learns the hard way. That's the power of a good fiction novel for me."

        "text":"Some books imprint themselves on your mind and stay with you. You can remember vividly where you were when you first read them. Hatchet is one of those books for me. I remember being in Mrs. Alison’s sixth grade class, and this book was raging though the male half of my class like a wildfire. Even boys who usually hated reading couldn’t put it down. Obviously, as the class’s self-proclaimed queen of the bookworms, I wanted to know what all the fuss was about. So, when a copy finally made it back to the book cubbies that lined the back of the classroom, I nabbed it. And I totally saw what the fuss was about. Survival stories have been popular for centuries. Robinson Crusoe, Kidnapped, The Swiss Family Robinson; even The Odyssey had survival aspects. So what was so special about Hatchet? It was the story of a thirteen-year-old plane-crash victim struggling to survive in the Canadian wilderness. Alone. With nothing but his hatchet. This was a main character who was close to our age. Who was struggling to accept the recent divorce of his parents, which was something that multiple kids in our class were going through, and that the rest of us feared. Who had absolutely none of the knowledge and skills seemingly necessary to make it in the wild. Like the rest of us. Seriously, what middle school kid would actually know what to do if they were dropped in the woods, alone, with no supplies and no tools except for a hatchet? If we’re honest, most of us as adults would have no clue what to do, either. One thing about kids, though; they don’t know enough yet to doubt their ability to survive anything. Kids believe that death doesn’t apply to them, and in some ways that’s the only way one could survive this type of dire situation. And survive Brian does. But Paulsen doesn’t pull punches; this is not a romanticized survival story, where food falls in the protagonist’s lap and they never get so much as a blister. Brian gets put through the wringer. This poor child get severely sunburned, violently ill from bad fruit, attacked by various forest dwellers, and more. Not to mention the near starvation he is constantly battling. As a twelve-year-old, this book was terrifying and empowering and completely enthralling. I’ve read it six more times since then, and it’s still all of those things, with a healthy dose of nostalgia thrown in. So thanks, boys in my class, for getting me interested. If you’re a parent, you should definitely get this book for your kids. If you’re still a kid at heart and have never read this, track down a copy. You never know; the things you learn from this book could save your life if you ever get stranded alone in the middle of a forest."

I love it when I am searching for an audiobook and books like this pop up as available. I think, “Ah ha! I can finally get to this one!” It did not take me long to get through Hatchet during my daily lunchtime walks. It held my interest throughout, but probably wasn’t even long enough to lose it! It is definitely geared toward pre and early teens – however, there are a couple of more difficult topics (like death and survival) that this might be a kids first introduction to (unless they are like me and started reading Stephen King at 12!) If my kids decide to try this one out, I will be there for them if they have any questions about it. Should you read this book? It is not bad for a quick read, but it may prove to be too simple for some peoples’ tastes. If you can adjust your mindset and think of it like a 10- to 13-year-old would, I think you will appreciate it more.

        "text":"Despite some of the repetition getting annoying from time to time, Hatchet is an engrossing story of survival for a young boy unfortunate enough to endure a plane crash to become stranded in the Canadian wilderness. For the most part the story sticks to realistic stuff, concentrating mainly on hunger and food. So many other survival stories focus on more, but really the basics of food and hunger and survival would be the forefront issue most would encounter if stranded alone. It sets in fast and it's almost constant. Brian shows he has what it takes to survive, but the author doesn't make the child come across as anything super since he shows that nature is uncontrollable and that it's luck of the draw for us all. The author even ends the narrative of the story saying that if Brian had been unlucky enough to be stranded during wintertime in the Canadian wilderness, he very likely wouldn't have survived at all. His dependency on the lake is the only reason he made it past the first few days, and then subsequent months, but a frozen lake would have nixed that. Although realistic with its focus on hunger and survival, it did have an unlikely tornado that felt contrived. Still the story can be forgiven this, as it focused on things like swarms of mosquitoes, baking sun, a random rude moose and other concerns. Brian didn't venture far from the landing, and I'm not sure I would have either. Some would venture far to try and find salvation themselves but he stuck to one area and stayed close to the shelter and food\/water supply that were guaranteed to be sure. A more cautious method that worked. Not sure what I would have done in his circumstances, but I see the point that the chances of shelter like that would have been few and far between. Written for children, it's more interesting and educational than upsetting. I do wish the author had spent more time granting us a deeper afterword. I realize the point of the story was the struggle, but I like to see more time involved with the after effect. Just a pet peeve of mine. We did get a small one at least. Besides the survival story being the focus, the Secret also weighed heavy in his mind, and ends up being a continuous thing he has to carry. The story ties into the Hatchet being the main tool he used to get started, but I do have to wonder why kind of random present that is that a mother gives a young boy. Either way, came in handy. Even if the repetition with the writer's style grew too much at times, it was to the point and paced well. I can see why it won so many children's awards, including Newberry Honor."

        "text":"basically, Biran is the main character in the story, he is getting on a plane to go visit his father; his parents are divorced. he also has a giant burden on his back, his mother was having an affair. before he leaves , his mother gives him a hatchet. after, he sets off, he talks with the pilot and has a little fun by piloting the airplane swerving and swoppoing up and down. until suddenly, the pilot has a heartattack becasue of gas and dies. brian is forced to fly the plane himself, but until the fuel runs out, he stops at a lake to kind of softne the impact. he wakes upon a beach. this starts him on his new journey, a journey to survive. this is kind of a rebirth for him; he learns to do things he would nt neccesarily do in life, but now that he has to, he is. he learns how to survive, he fends off cretures such as skinks, porcupines, bears, and mooses; he is able to be keep himself from starvation by findinf food among trees and the creatures of the wild such as fowls and rabbits and fish. he also creates his own shelter, fire,, his own weapons for hunting, a pond for which he keeps a stock of fish, and a list of things he makes so that his life is a little bit ore easier than it is in the wild( even though its not that easy in the first place). basically, one day, a tornado rips his location apart. he still survives, but when he goes outside, he sees that the plane he flew in was flipped up. he then figures out that there was a survival pack in the back of the plane; he goes and retireves it. after hard work, he ravages through the bag. he finds his own riches such as pots and pans, food, guns, radio which he immedialitey uses. he then feasts on packs of food and drink from the survival pack. until a plane comes and lands in the lake. he steps out and sees brian. the stroy ends with the epilouge wchich tells of brian and how he was the kid people had been looking for for over two months. how he had no fat in hsi body anymore and exploited the area in which he lived in and ws able to survive in. i really enjoyed this story. it seems like one of the stories that you know you can learn from if youre ever in brians situation. i know that if i was in the wilderness near a lake, i could proibably reenact his actions to survive; but id most defintiely need a hatchet, or he and i would naver ever be able to pull anything off. .....awesome story:)"

        "text":"I.love.this.book. Seriously, I read this maybe in fourth grade? It was definitly in elementary school, because I remember it was at the same time that we we doing \"survival skills\"* in Girl Scouts. Not that I ever wanted to be trapped by myself in the wilderness, but I spent a lot of my time in my backyard pretending to find flint with my sister, and starting imaginary fires to keep warm. In winter we dug ourselves igloos. I always went camping with my parents, so this book started a lot of Q&A's with them about what to do if I get lost in the woods (Hint, No. 1 is STAY WHERE YOU ARE!). Any ways, its a great read for an elementary kid, and everyone should read it. * This was put in quotation marks because it was a total joke. I had been looking forward to these skills for quite some time, finally girl scouts was going to teach me what I wanted! Instead of knives they handed us popsicle sticks. For the love of God CUB SCOUTS get real knives. This was followed shortly on the heels of an outdoor cooking class where none of us were allowed near the fire. Basically we made banana boats, and then the instructor put the boats in and out of the coals for us. We learned how to build a fire with coals, not tinder. Agh. It was at this point that I decided Girl Scouts was NOT for me."

I love survival stories, children without adult stories, this is quite a tough story, I err on the survival stories where you have some sort of home created, some comforting details, much appreciated because of the hardship. Brian certainly had a lot of hardship and how ironic that when he finds after 2 months of hell, a survival pack from the crash with a sleeping bag, gun, cooking stuff and copious amounts of dried food, a plane lands to rescue him before he's even had a spoonful! We began to find it amusing just how unlucky Brian managed to be! And phew! noticing this was a series of books we wondered if he would get rescued! But luckily for Brian he does! The cover on this book is a perfect example of an illustrator not reading the story, again and again we are told how Brian is weather beaten and sunburnt to a crisp, and yet the cover picture makes me think of a 1980s new romantic look complete with black eyeliner!

        "text":"So when I added this, I vaguely recalled the title, and I swear, I have definitely read it, but what I thought it was about was a boy being stuck under the snow following an avalanche (it turns out the book I was thinking of is apty named Avalanche by Arthur Roth) but anyway, that's not what it is about, and I really don't remember this book at all. Hatchet I definitely read in middle school at the instruction of my librarian (we had a sort of once-weekly class in the library to introduce us to the already anachronistic card catalog, and maybe to encourage us to read). It strikes me now as one of those \"boy books\" and was sort of offered to me as an alternative to Babysitters' Club or Nancy Drew, maybe. It's strange now, because it undervalues literature very much to say that some is suited to boys, and others to girls (which is to say nothing of our society's pathetic need to classify and categorize). Based on my vague and unreliable memory (and the description gleaned from amazon), here are the reasons why you should have your son, nephew, homeless male orphan read Hatchet : 1) It is the story about a boy named Brian. Brian is a great boy name (maybe you've considered it for your tot?), and everything he does (probably) exudes the same brand of outdoorsy masculinity that you want your little Timmy, Tommy or Teddy to adopt as an adolescent and adult. 2) It takes place outside. What better way to encourage kids to go outside than to have them sit inside and read a book about a boy who is outside? 3) There is a hatchet, presumably. Whether little Johnny has that lumberjack vibe, or that investment banker gone Sarsgaard-murder-house vibe, certainly it will be important to introduce them to the concept of the hatchet. A very useful tool that almost no one uses, as far as I know. 4) The plot evidently features a plane crash, wherein Brian must be the lone survivor. Very likely to happen. Also, surely all the characters in this book are male, what better way to introduce your young one to a realistic view of the world than to immerse them in world dominated completely by a young boy and some owls, or something. (also see: Lord of the Flies ) 5. This 20th anniversary edition features a great commentary by the author, Gary Paulson. Even though your little brat probably won't read this (why would he?), it will give his ego the small boost for the illusion of having read a book a little longer than he actually did). 6. This is the first installation of a SAGA. For one, \"saga\" is reminiscent to me of the Nordic mythos, which seems to be the most supporting of the idealized male image. It also means there are multiple volumes following our intrepid Brian. What more could you want? Why invest in Boy Scouts when you could drop a pile of Brian books in your kid's lap and turn him into a man, while saving all that time and money? Get it! So good!"

Looking back, I can't quite remember what it was I disliked about it so much. I can only guess it was because I was a huge reader even then, but I hated being told what to read; it also took time away from my other books. Reading it again, 10 years later (and again at least once a year since) it has become one of my favorites, quite possibly in my top 10.

The first thing Brain did after he crashed was he panicked, he felt lost, and he missed his family. The author described other emotions Brian felt when he was alone in the forest like hopelessness, desperation, and hunger. Every time the author expressed a feeling, it would always paint a realistic picture in my head, sometimes sending chills down my spine. I wondered “If I was in that situation, what would I do?” Although I think I would lose hope in these situations, I will get myself together and try my best to keep my self from negative emotions and hunger. It's in human nature to have a strong desire to survive. Reading this book reminded me of the movie \"The life of Pi.\" Surviving on a boat with a tiger for 227 days?! I would rather drown myself. What made Pi survive was faith. When you have faith, you have hope. When you have hope, you can see the light at the end of the tunnel. That's what motivates you to overcome difficulties and achieve your dream. Faith is what made me get up 6 o'clock in the morning to attend swimming lessons. I am still young, there will be a lot of difficulties I will be facing in my life, but I think as long as I have faith in myself, I believe I can overcome a lot of challenges and achieve my dreams."

        "text":"This was quite the treat! Young Brian is flying to Canada to visit his father during the summer after his parents have recently gotten divorced. The reason as well as the divorce itself are eating away at Brian. That is until his pilot has a heart attack and he crashes in the middle of the Canadian wilderness and has to get creative in order to survive. The book is relatively minimalist, but that in no way makes it less good. It's the story of a boy and nature and the unbreakable spirit of some people. I wish this kind of survivalist story was (still) more popular. Because neither children nor adults are generally this knowledgeable about nature anymore. Most just stand around and scream whenever anything happens. Yes, I'm one of the kids who spent a lot of time outside. I watched TV, I got a computer as a teen, my parents weren't some hippies, but I was also outside a lot and learned about making fire and finding shelter, knowing what to eat and what not when in a forest. I have colleages 10 years my senior who didn't even realize that the \"large chicken breasts\" their butcher often has aren't chicken breasts but turkey breasts and that those are two very different animals. *rolls eyes* So I really enjoyed the can-do spirit, the learning curve (that the boy was neither hysterical nor unrealistically faultless in his actions), the progression of the time spent in the wild, the Boy Scout feel of it all. I can see why so many have read this book, often in school, in the past; and why a lot of kids might dig this. It wasn't perfect, but it was a pretty neat adventure with high stakes that teaches the reader a lot about mental attitude and fortitude."

I started reading it and said, \"Damn, I hate it when authors use this kind of tone for kids, emphasizing 'secret' so damn much in extremely short and supposedly powerful ways that just sounds so faux-mysterious.\" A second later it dawned on me that I knew the rest of the story. Another second later, I realized it wasn't because the survival trope was so damn common. It was because I HAD read it and just plain forgot it. Huh. Well, anyway, it made me think about how survival tropes haven't really been around anymore. I mean, sure, we have Hunger Games and just about every Anime out there, but there's not too much in modern lit, not that I've seen. Notable examples to the contrary are Life of Pi, etc., but many of these serve as either satire or dark commentary. Whatever happened to this kind of genre, especially SF? Heinlein's juveniles used to be full of it. How odd. Oh? What about this book? lol It's fine. It made me angry and nostalgic in turn. Mostly entirely because of the Boy Scouts. I remember survival training and then I remembered that the whole thing of the BOY SCOUTS is dead now. Survival training and survival literature have both died. I think that's kinda ironic."

Although this story is often on middle-school reading lists, amazingly, I've never read it myself, so I thought I better rectify this. Positives: 1. I could readily empathize with Brian's wonders, fears and accomplishments; 2. being from northern Canada myself, I was quite pleased when I correctly recognized the flora and fauna Brian encountered as food sources, such as his so-called \"gutberries\" (chokecherries), \"nutbushes\" (chestnut shrubs) and \"fool birds\" (ruffed grouse); and, 3. if read aloud or freely chosen for personal reading, I could easily see older primary and upper-elementary students enjoying this survival\/adventure story. Negatives: 1. phrasing was repetitive at times and could be distracting; and, 2. Brian's encounter with the skunk was quite the head-shaker for me - even a 6-year old wouldn't have done what Brian did!

        "text":"Hatchet is a story about a young boy (Brian) struggling to survive after his plane crashes in a forest. He was traveling by airplane from the United States to Canada to see his father when the pilot suddenly had a heart attack. Brian lands the plane, but now he’s injured--and all alone with nothing but the hatchet his mother gave him. As Brian strives to find ways to survive, he learns and adapts to the new environment, but he faces many challenges with animals and the elements. Left to survive on his instincts and what he’s learned in the past, Brian ponders over his family situation and deals with many emotions. He’s a strong boy and becomes quite resourceful, but can he survive the Canadian wilderness? Gary Paulsen is one of my favorite authors, and it all started with this book, Hatchet . This book unequivocally is a favorite from childhood, and this is probably my third or fourth time reading it in my lifetime. This story never gets old. Brian is a relatable character, and what he’s going through feels real; in fact, this book reads like nonfiction, in my opinion. It’s adventurous, engrossing, and full of suspense. Not only that, it’s thought-provoking and makes you ask questions about what you'd do in a similar situation. How prepared would you be? Do you have what it takes to survive? What’s it like to be completely alone in the wilderness? It can make your imagination run wild, and maybe that’s just one of the reasons why kids enjoy this story so much. Readers who enjoy the outdoors or those who like survival stories will likely enjoy this book. This is a middle-grade book, but I’ve read it multiple times in adulthood and have enjoyed it all the same. Something I love about this story is Brian’s perseverance and how he learns from his mistakes. There are important lessons to learn. It’s a good story for boys, but girls will likely enjoy it too. The writing makes this a quick and easy read, but the book explores death, survival, divorce, anger, and even suicidal thoughts. Hatchet is a book I would personally recommend for young readers who struggle with reading or those who don't have an interest in reading. Definitely use your own discretion on whether your reader can handle these deeper themes though. Hatchet is book #1 in the Brian’s Saga series. I’ve read them all and will read them again and again. This is a series I’d recommend to anyone. The audio by Peter Coyote is amazing and perfectly sets the tone for this book. My kids enjoyed it along with their physical copies. 4.5-stars You can also see this review @readrantrockandroll.com"

While he was happy to see his father, his secret weighed heavily on his heart. As he pondered his secret, the pilot suddenly suffered a heart attack and died. The sudden and shocking turn of events left him stunned. Realizing that crying wouldn't help, he forced himself to try and fly the plane. Somehow, he managed to land the plane in an unknown lake deep in the wilderness. Scrambling to safety, he realised his ordeal was far from over. Hunger, cold, swarms of mosquitoes, wild animals, and painful injuries were constant threats. Brian had no time to dwell on his secret; he had to survive. With only a hatchet, he was completely alone. He tried to recall all the survival skills he had learned, but practical application was much harder than he imagined. Desperate and defeated, Brian lay down and prepared to give up. But as he calmed down, he realized he had made a huge mistake. Knowledge and practice needed to be connected through thought and patience. Fear and death could be overcome with courage and confidence. And he hadn’t even truly tried. In this primitive wilderness, with no trace of modern civilization, Brian was the sole source of knowledge. He told himself he was his most valuable asset. In that moment, Brian was reborn. Brian gradually adapted to life in the wilderness and felt a sense of accomplishment he had never known before. He had endless tasks, new discoveries, and new goals. As this life became his norm, he began to miss his parents. He started to feel sorry for himself, questioning why he was so unlucky. But looking at his achievements, he realized that self-pity was pointless. Surviving was the greatest luck of all. He was grateful for the rising sun, the calm lake, and his delicious catches of fish and rabbit. However, Brian couldn't forget “the secret,” It was a secret about his parents' divorce that weighed heavily on him. If Brian taught us many life lessons, what should we as adults do? As parents, have we realized our responsibilities and obligations? But do we really have to be responsible for our children's lives? Life is full of hardships, and there are countless problems, worries, and unexpected accidents in the world. Should we tolerate, forgive, and compromise for the sake of others? A parent's love for their child is profound. This profound love means allowing children to develop independent personalities, equipping them to face various difficulties and life changes on their own, and preventing them from becoming self-destructive or losing their motivation due to temporary setbacks. A person's happiness and fulfillment are directly affected by whether their personality is complete and independent. Only when one is happy and fulfilled can they help and influence others. A truly independent and complete personality is characterized by a gradual detachment from dependence and a willingness to take responsibility for one's actions. Regardless of your marital status, teaching your children these things is a positive gift and a parental responsibility. We can leave our children money, houses, cars, and connections, which are valuable assets. However, teaching them how to use and manage these assets is the eternal way. Perhaps our children will never experience what Brian went through, but no one's life is perfect. In addition to material wealth, it is more important to provide spiritual guidance and support, and to help them apply the knowledge they have learned to practical situations as much as possible, then let them go. Teaching someone to fish can solve a lifetime of hunger. 3.4 \/ 5"

The 'really?' was because this is a three-time Newberry Award winner, and I thought the prose was way too repetitive. The same word would be repeated three times. The same sentences twice. I was steeling myself to keep listening and hope it got better. It did. By the end of this novel, I totally realized why it is a Newberry Award winner. Hatchet is a story of survival. The protagonist is a thirteen-year-old city boy who ends up stranded in the Canadian wilderness when the pilot of the small plane he's flying in has a heart attack and dies. I have to tell you, I am very impressed with this kid. I think I would have freaked like nobody's business. He does freak out at first (and I don't blame him), but ultimately shows a fortitude that inspires awe in this reader. He goes from a scared, helpless boy to a survivor. The Brian that was has to be broken down and reassembled into a Brian that can survive his new reality. He learns how to meet his needs in the harsh wilderness, and he comes out of it forever changed. I love reading books\/watching tv shows and movies about surviving. I don't know why, really. I don't even go camping or hiking, although I love the outdoors. I think it's because I love the idea of a person being resourceful and pitting their skills and mentality against the unprejudiced, often unsympathetic wild. Not conquering it, but learning to live in harmony, becoming a part of a vast ecosystem in a way that we can't do stuck in our comfortable city and surburban environs, another entity in the web of life. I would definitely recommend this book if you are of a similar mind. I liked that Brian doesn't get it too easy. Not at all. He has to learn from his mistakes, and take the advantages that providence sends his way. He learns to keep food in his belly, to make a secure shelter, and to appreciate and anticipate the dangers of his environment. And in the process, he finds peace. He looks inside and finds his true self. That's what solitude and a oneness with nature will bring. I have always felt my most at peace in two places: in a spirit-filled church or by myself and with my heart open in prayer; and outside, surrounded by nature. So I really appreciated this aspect of the book. Brian starts out a boy who is emotionally lost at sea when his father and mother divorce, weighted down with the knowledge of his mother's infidelity; and finds that what seemed like tragedy and the end of his world will not conquer him. If he can survive the harsh elements of nature, all by himself, he can live with his family's fragmentation, and live to see the next day and the days after that. I think this book is a metaphor for life. Life is harsh and we have to grow and change to survive it. We can't give up, descend into pity, and expect to be saved. We have to be strong and fight to save ourselves, whether it's physically, mentally, or emotionally. Although this book had a very shaky start, I do have to agree that this is a winner. And I tell you what, this young man had a lot of lessons to teach me, lessons he learns the hard way. That's the power of a good fiction novel for me."

        "text":"Some books imprint themselves on your mind and stay with you. You can remember vividly where you were when you first read them. Hatchet is one of those books for me. I remember being in Mrs. Alison’s sixth grade class, and this book was raging though the male half of my class like a wildfire. Even boys who usually hated reading couldn’t put it down. Obviously, as the class’s self-proclaimed queen of the bookworms, I wanted to know what all the fuss was about. So, when a copy finally made it back to the book cubbies that lined the back of the classroom, I nabbed it. And I totally saw what the fuss was about. Survival stories have been popular for centuries. Robinson Crusoe, Kidnapped, The Swiss Family Robinson; even The Odyssey had survival aspects. So what was so special about Hatchet? It was the story of a thirteen-year-old plane-crash victim struggling to survive in the Canadian wilderness. Alone. With nothing but his hatchet. This was a main character who was close to our age. Who was struggling to accept the recent divorce of his parents, which was something that multiple kids in our class were going through, and that the rest of us feared. Who had absolutely none of the knowledge and skills seemingly necessary to make it in the wild. Like the rest of us. Seriously, what middle school kid would actually know what to do if they were dropped in the woods, alone, with no supplies and no tools except for a hatchet? If we’re honest, most of us as adults would have no clue what to do, either. One thing about kids, though; they don’t know enough yet to doubt their ability to survive anything. Kids believe that death doesn’t apply to them, and in some ways that’s the only way one could survive this type of dire situation. And survive Brian does. But Paulsen doesn’t pull punches; this is not a romanticized survival story, where food falls in the protagonist’s lap and they never get so much as a blister. Brian gets put through the wringer. This poor child get severely sunburned, violently ill from bad fruit, attacked by various forest dwellers, and more. Not to mention the near starvation he is constantly battling. As a twelve-year-old, this book was terrifying and empowering and completely enthralling. I’ve read it six more times since then, and it’s still all of those things, with a healthy dose of nostalgia thrown in. So thanks, boys in my class, for getting me interested. If you’re a parent, you should definitely get this book for your kids. If you’re still a kid at heart and have never read this, track down a copy. You never know; the things you learn from this book could save your life if you ever get stranded alone in the middle of a forest."

I love it when I am searching for an audiobook and books like this pop up as available. I think, “Ah ha! I can finally get to this one!” It did not take me long to get through Hatchet during my daily lunchtime walks. It held my interest throughout, but probably wasn’t even long enough to lose it! It is definitely geared toward pre and early teens – however, there are a couple of more difficult topics (like death and survival) that this might be a kids first introduction to (unless they are like me and started reading Stephen King at 12!) If my kids decide to try this one out, I will be there for them if they have any questions about it. Should you read this book? It is not bad for a quick read, but it may prove to be too simple for some peoples’ tastes. If you can adjust your mindset and think of it like a 10- to 13-year-old would, I think you will appreciate it more.

Brian has to survive in the Canadian Woods on his own for a summer. He learns to make fire, shelter and hunt for fish and birds. There is also a divorce theme going on as Brian's parents have recently split. This is your typical survival tale. Brian does face some harsh environments and he learns to be tough physically and more importantly - mentally. He doesn't give in to feeling sorry for himself. This is very well written and there is a reason it is so popular. I will read more of the Brian Saga."

        "text":"Despite some of the repetition getting annoying from time to time, Hatchet is an engrossing story of survival for a young boy unfortunate enough to endure a plane crash to become stranded in the Canadian wilderness. For the most part the story sticks to realistic stuff, concentrating mainly on hunger and food. So many other survival stories focus on more, but really the basics of food and hunger and survival would be the forefront issue most would encounter if stranded alone. It sets in fast and it's almost constant. Brian shows he has what it takes to survive, but the author doesn't make the child come across as anything super since he shows that nature is uncontrollable and that it's luck of the draw for us all. The author even ends the narrative of the story saying that if Brian had been unlucky enough to be stranded during wintertime in the Canadian wilderness, he very likely wouldn't have survived at all. His dependency on the lake is the only reason he made it past the first few days, and then subsequent months, but a frozen lake would have nixed that. Although realistic with its focus on hunger and survival, it did have an unlikely tornado that felt contrived. Still the story can be forgiven this, as it focused on things like swarms of mosquitoes, baking sun, a random rude moose and other concerns. Brian didn't venture far from the landing, and I'm not sure I would have either. Some would venture far to try and find salvation themselves but he stuck to one area and stayed close to the shelter and food\/water supply that were guaranteed to be sure. A more cautious method that worked. Not sure what I would have done in his circumstances, but I see the point that the chances of shelter like that would have been few and far between. Written for children, it's more interesting and educational than upsetting. I do wish the author had spent more time granting us a deeper afterword. I realize the point of the story was the struggle, but I like to see more time involved with the after effect. Just a pet peeve of mine. We did get a small one at least. Besides the survival story being the focus, the Secret also weighed heavy in his mind, and ends up being a continuous thing he has to carry. The story ties into the Hatchet being the main tool he used to get started, but I do have to wonder why kind of random present that is that a mother gives a young boy. Either way, came in handy. Even if the repetition with the writer's style grew too much at times, it was to the point and paced well. I can see why it won so many children's awards, including Newberry Honor."

Just listened to Peter Coyote read it while riding back from Yellowstone, and loved it. Great story, well told, well read. An adventure story in part based on tough guy (with a big heart) Paulson's own survival of a plane crash and other near death experiences. When I think of that kid there finding ways to survive at a lake in Nowhere, Canada, miles from civilization, I see it precisely, I have been there, in the way of the best books. And some genuine heart-pumping moments. Paulsen's great achievement. How is it it rates only 3.61 from GR readers?!

For the love of God CUB SCOUTS get real knives. This was followed shortly on the heels of an outdoor cooking class where none of us were allowed near the fire. Basically we made banana boats, and then the instructor put the boats in and out of the coals for us. We learned how to build a fire with coals, not tinder. Agh.

Hatchet I definitely read in middle school at the instruction of my librarian (we had a sort of once-weekly class in the library to introduce us to the already anachronistic card catalog, and maybe to encourage us to read). It strikes me now as one of those \"boy books\" and was sort of offered to me as an alternative to Babysitters' Club or Nancy Drew, maybe. It's strange now, because it undervalues literature very much to say that some is suited to boys, and others to girls (which is to say nothing of our society's pathetic need to classify and categorize). Based on my vague and unreliable memory (and the description gleaned from amazon), here are the reasons why you should have your son, nephew, homeless male orphan read Hatchet : 1) It is the story about a boy named Brian. Brian is a great boy name (maybe you've considered it for your tot?), and everything he does (probably) exudes the same brand of outdoorsy masculinity that you want your little Timmy, Tommy or Teddy to adopt as an adolescent and adult. 2) It takes place outside. What better way to encourage kids to go outside than to have them sit inside and read a book about a boy who is outside? 3) There is a hatchet, presumably. Whether little Johnny has that lumberjack vibe, or that investment banker gone Sarsgaard-murder-house vibe, certainly it will be important to introduce them to the concept of the hatchet. A very useful tool that almost no one uses, as far as I know. 4) The plot evidently features a plane crash, wherein Brian must be the lone survivor. Very likely to happen. Also, surely all the characters in this book are male, what better way to introduce your young one to a realistic view of the world than to immerse them in world dominated completely by a young boy and some owls, or something. (also see: Lord of the Flies ) 5. This 20th anniversary edition features a great commentary by the author, Gary Paulson. Even though your little brat probably won't read this (why would he?), it will give his ego the small boost for the illusion of having read a book a little longer than he actually did). 6. This is the first installation of a SAGA. For one, \"saga\" is reminiscent to me of the Nordic mythos, which seems to be the most supporting of the idealized male image. It also means there are multiple volumes following our intrepid Brian. What more could you want? Why invest in Boy Scouts when you could drop a pile of Brian books in your kid's lap and turn him into a man, while saving all that time and money? Get it! So good!"

The first thing Brain did after he crashed was he panicked, he felt lost, and he missed his family. The author described other emotions Brian felt when he was alone in the forest like hopelessness, desperation, and hunger. Every time the author expressed a feeling, it would always paint a realistic picture in my head, sometimes sending chills down my spine. I wondered “If I was in that situation, what would I do?” Although I think I would lose hope in these situations, I will get myself together and try my best to keep my self from negative emotions and hunger. It's in human nature to have a strong desire to survive. Reading this book reminded me of the movie \"The life of Pi.\" Surviving on a boat with a tiger for 227 days?! I would rather drown myself. What made Pi survive was faith. When you have faith, you have hope. When you have hope, you can see the light at the end of the tunnel. That's what motivates you to overcome difficulties and achieve your dream. Faith is what made me get up 6 o'clock in the morning to attend swimming lessons.

The reason as well as the divorce itself are eating away at Brian.

The book is relatively minimalist, but that in no way makes it less good. It's the story of a boy and nature and the unbreakable spirit of some people. I wish this kind of survivalist story was (still) more popular. Because neither children nor adults are generally this knowledgeable about nature anymore. Most just stand around and scream whenever anything happens. Yes, I'm one of the kids who spent a lot of time outside. I watched TV, I got a computer as a teen, my parents weren't some hippies, but I was also outside a lot and learned about making fire and finding shelter, knowing what to eat and what not when in a forest. I have colleages 10 years my senior who didn't even realize that the \"large chicken breasts\" their butcher often has aren't chicken breasts but turkey breasts and that those are two very different animals. *rolls eyes* So I really enjoyed the can-do spirit, the learning curve (that the boy was neither hysterical nor unrealistically faultless in his actions), the progression of the time spent in the wild, the Boy Scout feel of it all. I can see why so many have read this book, often in school, in the past; and why a lot of kids might dig this.

I mean, sure, we have Hunger Games and just about every Anime out there, but there's not too much in modern lit, not that I've seen.

        "text":"Due to clamor among his fans to hear the true stories of how Gary Paulsen gained the intimate knowledge of wilderness survival he wrote about to such convincing effect in Hatchet and the other Brian's Saga novels, the author released Father Water, Mother Woods: Essays on Fishing and Hunting in the North Woods in the 1990s. It was well-received, but readers lobbied for more. They craved specifics about the incidents in Mr. Paulsen's life that directly inspired thirteen-year-old Brian Robeson's harrowing adventures in the Canadian bush, adventures that could easily have killed the boy before rescuers arrived. Thus Guts: The True Stories Behind Hatchet and the Brian Books was born, a memoir specifically of the events that started the author thinking about writing a novel featuring a kid forced by circumstances to survive in the wilderness, far from the comfort and protection of modern urbania. For readers who want the scoop on Hatchet , Guts has everything you could want...and more. \"The wilderness pulled at me—still does—in a way that at first baffled me and then became a wonder for me.\" — Guts , P. 71 Gary Paulsen led a life of more variety than almost anyone, and volunteer paramedic in the Colorado boondocks was among his myriad occupations. As the only first responder close enough to react meaningfully in an emergency, Paulsen bore responsibility for the lives of many. This was where he learned about heart attacks, the most common malady of patients he was called to help. Paulsen could do nothing to save the majority of myocardial infarction victims, and one death that happened right in front of him haunted the author long after, coming through in Brian's experience with the pilot of his small plane who suffered a heart attack and died while their vehicle was airborne. As a paramedic and as an officer in the U.S. military, Paulsen also witnessed numerous plane crashes, some fatal but most not, and had a scare while on tour for his 1986 Newbery Honor book Dogsong when the engine of the small plane he was a passenger in sputtered and died. The pilot landed without any problem, but the helplessness of hanging 3,000 feet up in the air in a plane that had no engine would inform Brian's panicked response when the same thing happened to him with dire consequences. Another life-or-death situation involving a small plane saw an intrepid bush pilot flying into an insane winter storm in Alaska to rescue Paulsen and his sled dogs during the Iditarod. The incident leaves an indelible impression even as the scene it sets is downright comical. By the time Paulsen was honorably discharged from the military and had trained to earn his pilot's license, he was well on his way to knowing enough to write intelligently about Brian's plane crash. Bizarre animal assaults play a pivotal role in Brian's Saga, from rampaging moose to hungry bears, from surly skunks to monstrous swarms of mosquitos. Paulsen relates anecdotes about his own encounters with these assailants and more, but the most memorable may be when a massive cow moose waylaid him on a stormy night in the Alaskan bush. The attack was unprovoked and nightmarishly prolonged, as attacks feel when blow after vicious blow is hurting us and there's nothing we can do to stop it. The moose had Paulsen facedown in the snow and would not relent from stomping on him, bloodying the helpless musher and cracking his bones. \"She completely worked me over. I didn't count the kicks and stomps but there were dozens. She stopped after a bit and I peeked at her, outlined against the snow, and she was staring at me, listening for my breath, and when at last I could hold it no longer and had to breathe again she heard it and renewed the attack. I don't know how long she kept after me. It seemed hours, days. I lay as still as possible, trying to hide my breathing, but she kept coming back until I thought I was dead—and then she backed off. Thinking she was gone, I tried a small move, but she jumped me again. Finally I think she was convinced I was finished and she moved off into the forest.\" Sometimes all you can do when you're assaulted that way is curl up in a trembling little ball and hope to survive, and that's how Paulsen (and Brian) lived through their run-ins with lunatic moose. The only way to endure in a world that threatens your existence is to adapt and learn from its painful lessons, to not make serious mistakes twice. \"The solution to facing all these dangers, a solution that came very rapidly to me and to Brian, is knowledge. It can come from anywhere; from reading, from listening to people or from personal experience. However it comes, the knowledge must be there.\" Accumulating wisdom is the way to fend off danger whether you're in the wilderness or the safety of suburbia, which presents its own perils. Learning to avoid pitfalls is a trait possessed by every survivor. Brian's ability to stay alive in the bush hinged on fashioning functional hunting weapons with no one to teach him how, and Paulsen recounts his own experiences in this area. Crafting a usable bow and arrows from wood is hard work, and learning to hunt with them is more difficult still, but Paulsen and Brian each eventually did. The process requires attention to detail, and the author doesn't scrimp on explaining how to carve the wood and arrows just right. If the feathers aren't the proper shape and style, your arrows won't fly accurately. Once you make a kill, you have to clean and cook the animal, and that's at least as much work as carving handmade weapons. Paulsen relates his long, arduous journey after killing his first deer with a bow and arrow as a fifteen-year-old, dragging the dead buck that weighed more than him miles from the scene of the hunt to where he'd stashed his bicycle. It's hard to imagine how he biked four miles home while attempting to keep two hundred pounds of dead deer in balance, but Paulsen at that age was already adapting to the ways of nature, learning to be inconspicuous and predict what would happen next in the drama of the natural world around him. He knew it was essential to never stop growing and improving. \"To learn, to be willing to learn how a thing works, to understand an animal in nature, or how to write a book or run a dog team or sail a boat, to always keep learning is truly wonderful.\" This from someone who was not a diligent student in school, but had a passion to learn from nature the grand truths of life that school teachers rarely address. Spending time in school does not always equate to learning. Revolting food choices were part of life for Brian after his plane went down, but starvation pushed him to choke down edibles he wouldn't have wanted to look at in his previous life. Paulsen had high standards for the realism of Brian's Saga: \"When I set out to write the Brian books I was concerned that everything that happened to Brian should be based on reality, or as near reality as fiction could be. I did not want him to do things that wouldn't or couldn't really happen in his situation. Consequently I decided to write only of things that had happened to me or things I purposely did to make certain they would work for Brian.\" This includes the gross experiment of eating raw turtle eggs, which didn't end well for Paulsen. His commitment to authenticity in Brian's Saga was admirable, and stems from the undoubtedly finest philosophical observation in Guts , made in an earlier chapter. \"We have grown away from knowledge, away from knowing what something is really like, toward knowing only what somebody else says it is like. There seems to be a desire to ignore the truth in favor of drama.\" These words have so many practical applications, I hardly know where to begin. We outsource our religious, political, and social opinions to others who tell us how they think things are, not bothering to independently inform ourselves so we can challenge the pundits when they reason wrongly. Society has grown away from self-discovered knowledge and toward parroting the talking points of professional opinion givers, and that's not healthy. When we reject the nuance of reality in favor of black-and-white systemic ideology, we don't further education as Paulsen promotes it; we further ignorance, hampering our ability to recognize our errors of logic and reverse positions if the facts demand it. Gary Paulsen writes with uncompromising regard for truth, and that's why I love his work. Guts ends with a chapter on rudimentary cooking methods in the wild—how to heat water, make meat or fish stew, and cook using wood planks, a roasting spit, or a pot made from birch bark. It's important not to waste any part of the animals you hunt, because a next meal is never promised in the great outdoors. Paulsen concludes with an anecdote about the time he roasted buffalo meat for himself while employed as a movie production laborer, enjoying the fine meal under a starry night sky with a friend and reflecting on how it must have felt for early man to do the same every night. That started him thinking of writing a story about a modern-day kid having to survive under those conditions, and the rest, as they say, was history. The wisdom of Guts isn't as enlightening or plentiful as that in Woodsong , an earlier Gary Paulsen memoir of wilderness life, and the stories aren't nearly as emotional, but it's a good book. I'd give it at least two and a half stars, and strongly consider the full three. Gary Paulsen created something unforgettable in his Brian's Saga books, and I have loved them. They changed me for the better, and that can't be said of most literature. We've never seen a writing talent quite like Gary Paulsen, and we are oh so lucky to have him."

        "text":"Geesh I forgot that the first story in this book has about a bazillion reference to death, including a scene wherein a plane breaks in half and the people \"spill out\" into the water and are eaten by sharks and a really sad scene where a 50 year old man dies of a heart attack (described with vivid detail) at the dinner table? I remembered when I was reading it aloud to the 3rd graders and they keept asking \"is this real\"?! and I kept having to say \"yes\". that being said he does a pretty great job of tying in his experiences to the fictional texts they inspired. oh wait! dogs. there are dogs that get thrown. from the back of the plane to the front of the plane. He picks them up and throws them multipule times. it needs to be done, it's for their own good. but still. DOGS GET THROWN!"

        "text":"Gary Paulsen is one of the authors who made me a reader. I hated reading when I was a kid, but I loved the woods. I liked survival stories and learning about nature. Hatchet was one of the few books that I actually enjoyed. After reading Hatchet a few dozen times, I moved on to the rest of Gary Paulsen’s Brian books. In Guts, Paulsen talks about the real-life events that inspired him to write the Brian series. He has lived an unusual life, mostly in remote places. He writes about his time as a paramedic in rural Colorado (very close to where I currently live). He also tells stories about surviving in the wilderness in Minnesota and Alaska. Gary Paulsen has actually lived through everything that happens in the Brian books. This memoir covers his experiences with heart failure, plane crashes, animal attacks, and hunting mishaps. Paulsen’s writing style is conversational. I read this book straight through without putting it down because it felt like I was listening to a friend tell stories. I laughed out loud several times. The author has a way of understating deadly problems that makes me laugh. Then I feel terrible about laughing at his near-death experiences. They’re funny, though! My favorite story is the one where Paulsen and his 14 sled dogs got trapped in a blizzard and needed to be rescued by plane. The dogs were loose inside the plane and lost their minds when it took off and started bouncing around in the storm. During a 20-minute flight, the dogs destroyed the plane’s interior. They bit the pilot and almost caused the plane to crash. Not cool, dogs. The moral of the story: dogs on planes know no chill. My second-favorite story is the one where Gary wanted to know if it was possible to eat turtle eggs. He tried eating one and threw up. His dog caught the puke and swallowed it before it hit the ground. Again, not cool, dogs. “We have grown away from knowledge, away from knowing what something is really like, toward knowing only what somebody else says it is like. There seems to be a desire to ignore the truth in favor of drama.” – Guts If you’re not interested in hunting or wilderness survival, then this book might not be for you, but for me, it was perfect. It’s a quick, funny read that distracted me from the rest of the world. You’d probably get the most out of Guts if you’ve read the Brian books, but it’s not completely necessary. The stories are entertaining on their own."

        "text":"I taught seventh grade middle school for 35 years and during part of that time the sixth grade read Hatchet. Naturally when they came to me the following year some were hooked on Gary Paulsen books. From time-to-time I find myself reading teen books out of habit and desire, I have a list of authors I still enjoy and Gary Paulsen is one. His books have always made me feel I was sitting listening to him tell me the story. If you have read or you know someone who has read the \"Brian\" books I would recommend this book by Paulsen. In it Mr. Paulsen explains how some of the situations Brain finds himself in are based on his own life experiences. Although I purchased the book from a school book club I would also suggest it is good reading for any of the hunters in your life. It is fascinating to read how Mr. Paulsen made his own bow and arrows, as well as, teaching himself to hunt with this homemade equipment through trial and error. Finally it is a quick read for those reluctant readers. 150 pages and not full pages of reading. Enjoy something different."

        "text":"‘Guts’ by Gary Paulsen was a considerable novel. I really liked the overall story line as well as the action packed, real life situations Gary Paulsen experienced. The book was based of a similar, well know, novel ‘Hatchet’, which Gary Paulsen wrote 15 years before publishing ‘Guts’. During the book, Paulsen describes his near-death experiences in the wilderness chapter-to-chapter making the reader feel as if they where standing right their, with him. Each chapter is based of real life events which where published in his bestseller ‘Hatchet’, but from the perspective of the main character Brain Robeson, a 13 year-old boy. One reason I really liked this book, was because of the action. Normally when you see a biography it doesn’t seem very interesting, but Gary Paulsen did an outstanding job. The book starts with a chapter called, “Heart Attacks, Plane Crashes, and Flying”. It starts by describing Gary Paulsen’s life before he was fortunate enough to become a successful writer. He lived with his wife in a small prairie town in the middle of farm country, and with so much down time, Paulsen volunteered as a medic with only a small ambulance, which was donated by the city. Gary Paulsen, being the only service available for thousands of square miles, had to witness many deaths mostly form heart attacks. And sadly, Paulsen was the only hope except for the city helicopter, which sometimes took hours to arrive. This book was a great read, and I recommend it for someone who’s looking for an easy quick-read. If theirs one thing I learned from Gary Paulsen’s life, it was that well….it took guts."

        "text":"“Guts” is a book written about the events that led up to Gary Paulsen writing about Brian Robeson’s story in the books: Hatchet, The River, Brian’s Winter, and Brian’s Return. The first chapter is about the experiences Gary has had with airplanes which is how Brian ends up in the wilderness alone in “Hatchet.” The whole book is basically about all the times Gary has had encounters in the wilderness and how he had to cope with the problems he had. The main character in “Guts” is Gary Paulsen. There are other characters but they are not as important. The story is not really written in a set place. Gary talks about all the times he is in the wilderness so you could kind of say it is taken place in the wilderness but it is never really said. It is written from the time he was a young teen to a middle age adult. The main theme in this book is determination. Gary is saying how he has had so many tough times in the wilderness and he had to be determined to make it out alive. Another theme could be creativeness because Gary has to come up with ways to cook things, and make things while he is out in the wilderness. Overall, I thought that this book was very good. I always was putting myself in Gary’s shoes asking myself what I would do. I would recommend it to people who like to read books that are written about the wild and like adventure."

Very interesting but not my cup of tea. Hunting and the wilderness do not have an appeal to me. But the stories were well told and and interesting. I did notice something in this book though. Paulsen talks often in his book about earning money for food and school clothes as a child. I am a mother and thought, \"That is great that he is helping his parents out. He is older. He must have lived during the depression.\" But other clues lead me to believe he is not that old. (He was in the army as a young man during the Korean War.) There is one sentence in the entire book in which he discusses his parents. He said that he had to hunt because his parents were in one of their drunks. His parents were drunks, did not hold jobs, and left him to fend for himself at an early age. I am impressed with what he has done with his life. Very interesting book."

        "text":"I didn't read Hatchet as a kid. In fact, I still haven't read it. I will be getting to it soon, but until then I figured I would give Guts a try, seeing how it has gotten no small praise from other accounts I read of the books. Hatchet has come up enough in falconry circles to make me curious about it, and inevitably this book came up as well. Albeit, it has nothing at all to say about falconry in it. It does reaffirm my terror of moose, though. This book consists of a series of stories that illustrate how Gary Paulsen 's own life influenced the books which he wrote. The stories are to a point rough to read - he pulls few punches in describing how difficult life in the wild can be. The fact that the stories are true adds a veneer to them that wouldn't otherwise be there. People do go through this. They survive it sometimes. Nature doesn't care about you, and it cannot be tamed or subdued. You need to have your wits about you, and an awfully strong stomach. I think this would be an excellent book to recommend to any younger kid to get them reading. I think it lends itself to kids reluctant towards reading, as it is an easy read, but also full of compelling details that draw the person in. There's plane crashes, moose attacks, deer attacks, people freezing to death and starving. There's eating gross foods - including eyeballs and turtle eggs - and hunting with a bow carved by your own hand. Who doesn't want to read such an exciting adventure?"

Gary paulsen talks about of life lessons in this book like how to hunt, fish, catch, and many other things. One of the things in the book I can see coming up soon is i feel like he is going to get attacked by a buck himself that is going to hit him really hard. The parts of this book ia ma enjoying are the parts when he is out in the woods and he is hunting and going through dangerous events like the moose hitting him off his sled and stomping on him and trying to kill him. But the one thing i do dislike about his book is that everytime he does something he has to take time and tell how it is connected to the book and it really takes the intensity and your focus away from the book. i would recommend this book to everyone of my classmates because it really gets your blood pumping when he is in intense moments like him getting attacked or him seeing something dangerous."

Paulsen's other books like Hatchet, Brian's Return, and Brian's Winter were inspired by his experiences in the wilderness. The book starts off describing his love for planes and flying, and how he came about learning to fly. He then goes on to explain some painful encounters while he was in the wilderness. The last part of the book he explains how he hunted and how he prepared- if at all- his \"food\". I thought it was a good book mainly because it was an easy read but also his style of writing is easy to follow. It was very easy to picture a paragraph of his writing in my head something that I struggle to do when reading. It's hard to pick a favorite chapter because they were all very intriguing. If I had to choose a favorite chapter it would be the Moose attack. I enjoyed it because it sounded like an awful thing to have to go through. It seemed like the moose was going for the kill; I mean who knew that Moose were so aggressive towards anything that gave them a motive. For example, he mentions how while he was training for the Iditarod he witnessed a Moose charge at a tree and absolutely demolish it until there was nothing left of it. I would recommend this book to anyone who's interested in learning some survival skills or anyone in general just because of the imagery in this book."

Like when he was starving in the forest and said that he would eat anything that would make a normal person vomit just to survive. This really painted a picture in my head of how hungry Gary was and how desperate he was for any edible substance. When Gary got attacked by the cow moose when he was riding his sled of dogs I was astonished. If I was in Gary's position I would have never believed that I would make it out alive. Just picturing getting stomped by a moose like that using Gary's words made me cringe inside. The story about Gary watching the child feed the half tamed moose at the park and how the moose freaked out when the child made him reach for the candy had me in disbelief. I couldn't imagine that a moose would stab a child it's pointed hooves just for making it reach further to get the candy. The story really showed me how crazy of a life Gary has lived. For him to live through all of these crazy stories and tell about them is really amazing."

        "text":"Due to widespread clamor among fans to hear the true stories of how Gary Paulsen gained the intimate knowledge of wilderness survival he wrote about in Hatchet and the other Brian's Saga novels, the author released Father Water, Mother Woods: Essays on Fishing and Hunting in the North Woods in the 1990s. It was well-received, but readers lobbied for more. They craved specifics about the incidents in Mr. Paulsen's life that directly inspired thirteen-year-old Brian Robeson's harrowing adventures in the Canadian bush, adventures that could easily have killed the boy before rescuers arrived. Thus Guts: The True Stories Behind Hatchet and the Brian Books was born, a memoir specifically of the events that started the author thinking about writing a novel featuring a kid forced by circumstances to survive in the wilderness, far from the comfort and protection of modern urbania. For readers who want the scoop on Hatchet , Guts has everything you could want...and more. \"The wilderness pulled at me—still does—in a way that at first baffled me and then became a wonder for me.\" — Guts , P. 71 Gary Paulsen led a life of more variety than almost anyone, and volunteer paramedic in the Colorado boondocks was among his myriad occupations. As the only first responder close enough to react meaningfully in an emergency, Paulsen bore responsibility for the lives of many. This was where he learned about heart attacks, the most common malady of patients he was called to help. Paulsen could do nothing to save the majority of myocardial infarction victims, and one death that happened right in front of him haunted the author long after, coming through in Brian's experience with the pilot of his small plane who suffered a heart attack and died while their vehicle was airborne. As a paramedic and as an officer in the U.S. military, Paulsen also witnessed numerous plane crashes, some fatal but most not, and had a scare while on tour for his 1986 Newbery Honor book Dogsong when the engine of the small plane he was a passenger in sputtered and died. The pilot landed without any problem, but the helplessness of hanging 3,000 feet up in the air in a plane that had no engine would inform Brian's panicked response when the same thing happened to him with dire consequences. Another life-or-death situation involving a small plane saw an intrepid bush pilot flying into an insane winter storm in Alaska to rescue Paulsen and his sled dogs during the Iditarod. The incident leaves an indelible impression even as the scene it sets is downright comical. By the time Paulsen was honorably discharged from the military and had trained to earn his pilot's license, he was well on his way to knowing enough to write intelligently about Brian's plane crash. Bizarre animal assaults play a pivotal role in Brian's Saga, from rampaging moose to hungry bears, from surly skunks to monstrous swarms of mosquitos. Paulsen relates anecdotes about his own encounters with these assailants and more, but the most memorable may be when a massive cow moose waylaid him on a stormy night in the Alaskan bush. The attack was unprovoked and nightmarishly prolonged, as attacks feel when blow after vicious blow is hurting us and there's nothing we can do to stop it. The moose had Paulsen facedown in the snow and would not relent from stomping on him, bloodying the helpless musher and cracking his bones. \"She completely worked me over. I didn't count the kicks and stomps but there were dozens. She stopped after a bit and I peeked at her, outlined against the snow, and she was staring at me, listening for my breath, and when at last I could hold it no longer and had to breathe again she heard it and renewed the attack. I don't know how long she kept after me. It seemed hours, days. I lay as still as possible, trying to hide my breathing, but she kept coming back until I thought I was dead—and then she backed off. Thinking she was gone, I tried a small move, but she jumped me again. Finally I think she was convinced I was finished and she moved off into the forest.\" Sometimes all you can do when you're assaulted that way is curl up in a trembling little ball and hope to survive, and that's how Paulsen (and Brian) lived through their run-ins with lunatic moose. The only way to endure in a world that threatens your existence is to adapt and learn from its painful lessons, to not make serious mistakes twice. \"The solution to facing all these dangers, a solution that came very rapidly to me and to Brian, is knowledge. It can come from anywhere; from reading, from listening to people or from personal experience. However it comes, the knowledge must be there.\" Accumulating wisdom is the way to fend off danger whether you're in the wilderness or the safety of suburbia, which presents its own perils. Learning to avoid pitfalls is a trait possessed by every survivor. Brian's ability to stay alive in the bush hinged on fashioning functional hunting weapons with no one to teach him how, and Paulsen recounts his own experiences in this area. Crafting a usable bow and arrows from wood is hard work, and learning to hunt with them is more difficult still, but Paulsen and Brian each eventually did. The process requires attention to detail, and the author doesn't scrimp on explaining how to carve the wood and arrows just right. If the feathers aren't the proper shape and style, your arrows won't fly accurately. Once you make a kill, you have to clean and cook the animal, and that's at least as much work as carving handmade weapons. Paulsen relates his long, arduous journey after killing his first deer with a bow and arrow as a fifteen-year-old, dragging the dead buck that weighed more than him miles from the scene of the hunt to where he'd stashed his bicycle. It's hard to imagine how he biked four miles home while attempting to keep two hundred pounds of dead deer in balance, but Paulsen at that age was already adapting to the ways of nature, learning to be inconspicuous and predict what would happen next in the drama of the natural world around him. He knew it was essential to never stop growing and improving. \"To learn, to be willing to learn how a thing works, to understand an animal in nature, or how to write a book or run a dog team or sail a boat, to always keep learning is truly wonderful.\" This from someone who was not a diligent student in school, but had a passion to learn from nature the grand truths of life that school teachers rarely address. Spending time in school does not always equate to learning. Revolting food choices were part of life for Brian after his plane went down, but starvation pushed him to choke down edibles he wouldn't have wanted to look at in his previous life. Paulsen had high standards for the realism of Brian's Saga: \"When I set out to write the Brian books I was concerned that everything that happened to Brian should be based on reality, or as near reality as fiction could be. I did not want him to do things that wouldn't or couldn't really happen in his situation. Consequently I decided to write only of things that had happened to me or things I purposely did to make certain they would work for Brian.\" This includes the gross experiment of eating raw turtle eggs, which didn't end well for Paulsen. His commitment to authenticity in Brian's Saga was admirable, and stems from the undoubtedly finest philosophical observation in Guts , made in an earlier chapter. \"We have grown away from knowledge, away from knowing what something is really like, toward knowing only what somebody else says it is like. There seems to be a desire to ignore the truth in favor of drama.\" These words have so many practical applications, I hardly know where to begin. We outsource our religious, political, and social opinions to others who tell us how they think things are, not bothering to independently inform ourselves so we can challenge the pundits when they reason wrongly. Society has grown away from self-discovered knowledge and toward parroting the talking points of professional opinion givers, and that's not healthy. When we reject the nuance of reality in favor of black-and-white systemic ideology, we don't further education as Paulsen promotes it; we further ignorance, hampering our ability to recognize our errors of logic and reverse positions if the facts demand it. Gary Paulsen writes with uncompromising regard for truth, and that's why I love his work. Guts ends with a chapter on rudimentary cooking methods in the wild—how to heat water, make meat or fish stew, and cook using wood planks, a roasting spit, or a pot made from birch bark. It's important not to waste any part of the animals you hunt, because a next meal is never promised in the great outdoors. Paulsen concludes with an anecdote about the time he roasted buffalo meat for himself while employed as a movie production laborer, enjoying the fine meal under a starry night sky with a friend and reflecting on how it must have felt for early man to do the same every night. That started him thinking of writing a story about a modern-day kid having to survive under those conditions, and the rest, as they say, was history. The wisdom of Guts isn't as enlightening or plentiful as that in Woodsong , an earlier Gary Paulsen memoir of wilderness life, and the stories aren't nearly as emotional, but it's a good book. I'd give it at least two and a half stars, and strongly consider the full three. Gary Paulsen created something unforgettable in his Brian's Saga books, and I have loved them. They changed me for the better, and that can't be said of most literature. We've never seen a writing talent quite like Gary Paulsen, and we are oh so lucky to have him."

Since he parents were poor they couldn't afford much food so Gary went out by himself armed with a bow to come back with dinner. He had to provide for himself completely with working multiple jobs to afford school clothes. Then as he got older and got out of hunting he went to also to race dogs and sleigh. Hes won multiple races but the main thing he remembered from also is all the mosses. He said hes been attacked by multiple mosses. He then got into writhing books about his experiences which is where this book came from."

His adventures through the woods and the winter inspired the realization that Gary Paulsen's fate was to survive. To survive to write the series that impacted children and adults all over the world. His main message to us was that your survival depends on your luck, chance, and most importantly your guts. I strongly recommend people who have read the hatchet series and people who are searching for adventure to read this book. \"I remembered him and his eyes and I put him in the plane next to Brian because he was, above all things, real, and I wanted the book to be real.\""

        "text":"Summary: This is a biography by Gary Paulsen where he shares information about his life experiences, comedic anecdotes that relates to the stories he has written, and events that provided inspiration for many of his stories. The author perhaps most famous for the story Hatchet gives the reader insight into his life experiences and how they have resulted in the works that he has provided us with. Genre: Junior Biographical Critique: (a)\tThe book is provides accuracy in that he relays to the reader how his own personal experiences provided the basis for the characters in his books. The horrible things that Brian experiences in Hatchet were things that Paulsen himself experienced. All of these accounts provide an inside look into how the writings of Paulsen developed over time. (b)\tThe strongest elements of the book were the ability of Paulsen to relate his personal experiences to that of his characters as well as his ability to provide humor that also related to the stories and provided entertainment for the reader. The only negative aspect of this book is perhaps its graphic details, which could be off putting to many younger readers. (c)\tComedy is apparent in the book in a chapter that is titled “Eating Eyeballs and Guts or Starving: The Fine Art of Wilderness Nutrition.” You never know what you might have to eat to prevent starvation, and the author lets you know in very explicit detail. Curriculum Connection: This book would be a great tool for a literary unit about biographies or even as an introduction to literary units that include his books."

        "text":"Gary Paulsen is one of the authors who made me a reader. I hated reading when I was a kid, but I loved the woods. I liked survival stories and learning about nature. Hatchet was one of the few books that I actually enjoyed. After reading Hatchet a few dozen times, I moved on to the rest of Gary Paulsen’s Brian books. In Guts, Paulsen talks about the real-life events that inspired him to write the Brian series. He has lived an unusual life, mostly in remote places. He writes about his time as a paramedic in rural Colorado (very close to where I currently live). He also tells stories about surviving in the wilderness in Minnesota and Alaska. Gary Paulsen has actually lived through everything that happens in the Brian books. This memoir covers his experiences with heart failure, plane crashes, animal attacks, and hunting mishaps. Paulsen’s writing style is conversational. I read this book straight through without putting it down because it felt like I was listening to a friend tell stories. I laughed out loud several times. The author has a way of understating deadly problems that makes me laugh. Then I feel terrible about laughing at his near-death experiences. They’re funny, though! My favorite story is the one where Paulsen and his 14 sled dogs got trapped in a blizzard and needed to be rescued by plane. The dogs were loose inside the plane and lost their minds when it took off and started bouncing around in the storm. During a 20-minute flight, the dogs destroyed the plane’s interior. They bit the pilot and almost caused the plane to crash. Not cool, dogs. The moral of the story: dogs on planes know no chill. My second-favorite story is the one where Gary wanted to know if it was possible to eat turtle eggs. He tried eating one and threw up. His dog caught the puke and swallowed it before it hit the ground. Again, not cool, dogs. “We have grown away from knowledge, away from knowing what something is really like, toward knowing only what somebody else says it is like. There seems to be a desire to ignore the truth in favor of drama.” – Guts If you’re not interested in hunting or wilderness survival, then this book might not be for you, but for me, it was perfect. It’s a quick, funny read that distracted me from the rest of the world. You’d probably get the most out of Guts if you’ve read the Brian books, but it’s not completely necessary. The stories are entertaining on their own."

His books have always made me feel I was sitting listening to him tell me the story. If you have read or you know someone who has read the \"Brian\" books I would recommend this book by Paulsen. In it Mr. Paulsen explains how some of the situations Brain finds himself in are based on his own life experiences. Although I purchased the book from a school book club I would also suggest it is good reading for any of the hunters in your life. It is fascinating to read how Mr. Paulsen made his own bow and arrows, as well as, teaching himself to hunt with this homemade equipment through trial and error. Finally it is a quick read for those reluctant readers. 150 pages and not full pages of reading. Enjoy something different."

        "text":"‘Guts’ by Gary Paulsen was a considerable novel. I really liked the overall story line as well as the action packed, real life situations Gary Paulsen experienced. The book was based of a similar, well know, novel ‘Hatchet’, which Gary Paulsen wrote 15 years before publishing ‘Guts’. During the book, Paulsen describes his near-death experiences in the wilderness chapter-to-chapter making the reader feel as if they where standing right their, with him. Each chapter is based of real life events which where published in his bestseller ‘Hatchet’, but from the perspective of the main character Brain Robeson, a 13 year-old boy. One reason I really liked this book, was because of the action. Normally when you see a biography it doesn’t seem very interesting, but Gary Paulsen did an outstanding job. The book starts with a chapter called, “Heart Attacks, Plane Crashes, and Flying”. It starts by describing Gary Paulsen’s life before he was fortunate enough to become a successful writer. He lived with his wife in a small prairie town in the middle of farm country, and with so much down time, Paulsen volunteered as a medic with only a small ambulance, which was donated by the city. Gary Paulsen, being the only service available for thousands of square miles, had to witness many deaths mostly form heart attacks. And sadly, Paulsen was the only hope except for the city helicopter, which sometimes took hours to arrive. This book was a great read, and I recommend it for someone who’s looking for an easy quick-read. If theirs one thing I learned from Gary Paulsen’s life, it was that well….it took guts."

        "text":"“Guts” is a book written about the events that led up to Gary Paulsen writing about Brian Robeson’s story in the books: Hatchet, The River, Brian’s Winter, and Brian’s Return. The first chapter is about the experiences Gary has had with airplanes which is how Brian ends up in the wilderness alone in “Hatchet.” The whole book is basically about all the times Gary has had encounters in the wilderness and how he had to cope with the problems he had. The main character in “Guts” is Gary Paulsen. There are other characters but they are not as important. The story is not really written in a set place. Gary talks about all the times he is in the wilderness so you could kind of say it is taken place in the wilderness but it is never really said. It is written from the time he was a young teen to a middle age adult. The main theme in this book is determination. Gary is saying how he has had so many tough times in the wilderness and he had to be determined to make it out alive. Another theme could be creativeness because Gary has to come up with ways to cook things, and make things while he is out in the wilderness. Overall, I thought that this book was very good. I always was putting myself in Gary’s shoes asking myself what I would do. I would recommend it to people who like to read books that are written about the wild and like adventure."

        "text":"Now I know why the Hatchet and Brian books did not appeal to me. This book is a nonfiction book about how many of the scenarios and situations came about in Hatchet. Very interesting but not my cup of tea. Hunting and the wilderness do not have an appeal to me. But the stories were well told and and interesting. I did notice something in this book though. Paulsen talks often in his book about earning money for food and school clothes as a child. I am a mother and thought, \"That is great that he is helping his parents out. He is older. He must have lived during the depression.\" But other clues lead me to believe he is not that old. (He was in the army as a young man during the Korean War.) There is one sentence in the entire book in which he discusses his parents. He said that he had to hunt because his parents were in one of their drunks. His parents were drunks, did not hold jobs, and left him to fend for himself at an early age. I am impressed with what he has done with his life. Very interesting book."

        "text":"I didn't read Hatchet as a kid. In fact, I still haven't read it. I will be getting to it soon, but until then I figured I would give Guts a try, seeing how it has gotten no small praise from other accounts I read of the books. Hatchet has come up enough in falconry circles to make me curious about it, and inevitably this book came up as well. Albeit, it has nothing at all to say about falconry in it. It does reaffirm my terror of moose, though. This book consists of a series of stories that illustrate how Gary Paulsen 's own life influenced the books which he wrote. The stories are to a point rough to read - he pulls few punches in describing how difficult life in the wild can be. The fact that the stories are true adds a veneer to them that wouldn't otherwise be there. People do go through this. They survive it sometimes. Nature doesn't care about you, and it cannot be tamed or subdued. You need to have your wits about you, and an awfully strong stomach. I think this would be an excellent book to recommend to any younger kid to get them reading. I think it lends itself to kids reluctant towards reading, as it is an easy read, but also full of compelling details that draw the person in. There's plane crashes, moose attacks, deer attacks, people freezing to death and starving. There's eating gross foods - including eyeballs and turtle eggs - and hunting with a bow carved by your own hand. Who doesn't want to read such an exciting adventure?"

Gary paulsen talks about of life lessons in this book like how to hunt, fish, catch, and many other things. One of the things in the book I can see coming up soon is i feel like he is going to get attacked by a buck himself that is going to hit him really hard. The parts of this book ia ma enjoying are the parts when he is out in the woods and he is hunting and going through dangerous events like the moose hitting him off his sled and stomping on him and trying to kill him. But the one thing i do dislike about his book is that everytime he does something he has to take time and tell how it is connected to the book and it really takes the intensity and your focus away from the book. i would recommend this book to everyone of my classmates because it really gets your blood pumping when he is in intense moments like him getting attacked or him seeing something dangerous."

        "text":"Guts is about the real-life occurrences that Gary Paulsen encountered in his youth and middle age. Paulsen's other books like Hatchet, Brian's Return, and Brian's Winter were inspired by his experiences in the wilderness. The book starts off describing his love for planes and flying, and how he came about learning to fly. He then goes on to explain some painful encounters while he was in the wilderness. The last part of the book he explains how he hunted and how he prepared- if at all- his \"food\". I thought it was a good book mainly because it was an easy read but also his style of writing is easy to follow. It was very easy to picture a paragraph of his writing in my head something that I struggle to do when reading. It's hard to pick a favorite chapter because they were all very intriguing. If I had to choose a favorite chapter it would be the Moose attack. I enjoyed it because it sounded like an awful thing to have to go through. It seemed like the moose was going for the kill; I mean who knew that Moose were so aggressive towards anything that gave them a motive. For example, he mentions how while he was training for the Iditarod he witnessed a Moose charge at a tree and absolutely demolish it until there was nothing left of it. I would recommend this book to anyone who's interested in learning some survival skills or anyone in general just because of the imagery in this book."

Like when he was starving in the forest and said that he would eat anything that would make a normal person vomit just to survive. This really painted a picture in my head of how hungry Gary was and how desperate he was for any edible substance. When Gary got attacked by the cow moose when he was riding his sled of dogs I was astonished. If I was in Gary's position I would have never believed that I would make it out alive. Just picturing getting stomped by a moose like that using Gary's words made me cringe inside. The story about Gary watching the child feed the half tamed moose at the park and how the moose freaked out when the child made him reach for the candy had me in disbelief. I couldn't imagine that a moose would stab a child it's pointed hooves just for making it reach further to get the candy. The story really showed me how crazy of a life Gary has lived. For him to live through all of these crazy stories and tell about them is really amazing."

        "text":"Due to widespread clamor among fans to hear the true stories of how Gary Paulsen gained the intimate knowledge of wilderness survival he wrote about in Hatchet and the other Brian's Saga novels, the author released Father Water, Mother Woods: Essays on Fishing and Hunting in the North Woods in the 1990s. It was well-received, but readers lobbied for more. They craved specifics about the incidents in Mr. Paulsen's life that directly inspired thirteen-year-old Brian Robeson's harrowing adventures in the Canadian bush, adventures that could easily have killed the boy before rescuers arrived. Thus Guts: The True Stories Behind Hatchet and the Brian Books was born, a memoir specifically of the events that started the author thinking about writing a novel featuring a kid forced by circumstances to survive in the wilderness, far from the comfort and protection of modern urbania. For readers who want the scoop on Hatchet , Guts has everything you could want...and more. \"The wilderness pulled at me—still does—in a way that at first baffled me and then became a wonder for me.\" — Guts , P. 71 Gary Paulsen led a life of more variety than almost anyone, and volunteer paramedic in the Colorado boondocks was among his myriad occupations. As the only first responder close enough to react meaningfully in an emergency, Paulsen bore responsibility for the lives of many. This was where he learned about heart attacks, the most common malady of patients he was called to help. Paulsen could do nothing to save the majority of myocardial infarction victims, and one death that happened right in front of him haunted the author long after, coming through in Brian's experience with the pilot of his small plane who suffered a heart attack and died while their vehicle was airborne. As a paramedic and as an officer in the U.S. military, Paulsen also witnessed numerous plane crashes, some fatal but most not, and had a scare while on tour for his 1986 Newbery Honor book Dogsong when the engine of the small plane he was a passenger in sputtered and died. The pilot landed without any problem, but the helplessness of hanging 3,000 feet up in the air in a plane that had no engine would inform Brian's panicked response when the same thing happened to him with dire consequences. Another life-or-death situation involving a small plane saw an intrepid bush pilot flying into an insane winter storm in Alaska to rescue Paulsen and his sled dogs during the Iditarod. The incident leaves an indelible impression even as the scene it sets is downright comical. By the time Paulsen was honorably discharged from the military and had trained to earn his pilot's license, he was well on his way to knowing enough to write intelligently about Brian's plane crash. Bizarre animal assaults play a pivotal role in Brian's Saga, from rampaging moose to hungry bears, from surly skunks to monstrous swarms of mosquitos. Paulsen relates anecdotes about his own encounters with these assailants and more, but the most memorable may be when a massive cow moose waylaid him on a stormy night in the Alaskan bush. The attack was unprovoked and nightmarishly prolonged, as attacks feel when blow after vicious blow is hurting us and there's nothing we can do to stop it. The moose had Paulsen facedown in the snow and would not relent from stomping on him, bloodying the helpless musher and cracking his bones. \"She completely worked me over. I didn't count the kicks and stomps but there were dozens. She stopped after a bit and I peeked at her, outlined against the snow, and she was staring at me, listening for my breath, and when at last I could hold it no longer and had to breathe again she heard it and renewed the attack. I don't know how long she kept after me. It seemed hours, days. I lay as still as possible, trying to hide my breathing, but she kept coming back until I thought I was dead—and then she backed off. Thinking she was gone, I tried a small move, but she jumped me again. Finally I think she was convinced I was finished and she moved off into the forest.\" Sometimes all you can do when you're assaulted that way is curl up in a trembling little ball and hope to survive, and that's how Paulsen (and Brian) lived through their run-ins with lunatic moose. The only way to endure in a world that threatens your existence is to adapt and learn from its painful lessons, to not make serious mistakes twice. \"The solution to facing all these dangers, a solution that came very rapidly to me and to Brian, is knowledge. It can come from anywhere; from reading, from listening to people or from personal experience. However it comes, the knowledge must be there.\" Accumulating wisdom is the way to fend off danger whether you're in the wilderness or the safety of suburbia, which presents its own perils. Learning to avoid pitfalls is a trait possessed by every survivor. Brian's ability to stay alive in the bush hinged on fashioning functional hunting weapons with no one to teach him how, and Paulsen recounts his own experiences in this area. Crafting a usable bow and arrows from wood is hard work, and learning to hunt with them is more difficult still, but Paulsen and Brian each eventually did. The process requires attention to detail, and the author doesn't scrimp on explaining how to carve the wood and arrows just right. If the feathers aren't the proper shape and style, your arrows won't fly accurately. Once you make a kill, you have to clean and cook the animal, and that's at least as much work as carving handmade weapons. Paulsen relates his long, arduous journey after killing his first deer with a bow and arrow as a fifteen-year-old, dragging the dead buck that weighed more than him miles from the scene of the hunt to where he'd stashed his bicycle. It's hard to imagine how he biked four miles home while attempting to keep two hundred pounds of dead deer in balance, but Paulsen at that age was already adapting to the ways of nature, learning to be inconspicuous and predict what would happen next in the drama of the natural world around him. He knew it was essential to never stop growing and improving. \"To learn, to be willing to learn how a thing works, to understand an animal in nature, or how to write a book or run a dog team or sail a boat, to always keep learning is truly wonderful.\" This from someone who was not a diligent student in school, but had a passion to learn from nature the grand truths of life that school teachers rarely address. Spending time in school does not always equate to learning. Revolting food choices were part of life for Brian after his plane went down, but starvation pushed him to choke down edibles he wouldn't have wanted to look at in his previous life. Paulsen had high standards for the realism of Brian's Saga: \"When I set out to write the Brian books I was concerned that everything that happened to Brian should be based on reality, or as near reality as fiction could be. I did not want him to do things that wouldn't or couldn't really happen in his situation. Consequently I decided to write only of things that had happened to me or things I purposely did to make certain they would work for Brian.\" This includes the gross experiment of eating raw turtle eggs, which didn't end well for Paulsen. His commitment to authenticity in Brian's Saga was admirable, and stems from the undoubtedly finest philosophical observation in Guts , made in an earlier chapter. \"We have grown away from knowledge, away from knowing what something is really like, toward knowing only what somebody else says it is like. There seems to be a desire to ignore the truth in favor of drama.\" These words have so many practical applications, I hardly know where to begin. We outsource our religious, political, and social opinions to others who tell us how they think things are, not bothering to independently inform ourselves so we can challenge the pundits when they reason wrongly. Society has grown away from self-discovered knowledge and toward parroting the talking points of professional opinion givers, and that's not healthy. When we reject the nuance of reality in favor of black-and-white systemic ideology, we don't further education as Paulsen promotes it; we further ignorance, hampering our ability to recognize our errors of logic and reverse positions if the facts demand it. Gary Paulsen writes with uncompromising regard for truth, and that's why I love his work. Guts ends with a chapter on rudimentary cooking methods in the wild—how to heat water, make meat or fish stew, and cook using wood planks, a roasting spit, or a pot made from birch bark. It's important not to waste any part of the animals you hunt, because a next meal is never promised in the great outdoors. Paulsen concludes with an anecdote about the time he roasted buffalo meat for himself while employed as a movie production laborer, enjoying the fine meal under a starry night sky with a friend and reflecting on how it must have felt for early man to do the same every night. That started him thinking of writing a story about a modern-day kid having to survive under those conditions, and the rest, as they say, was history. The wisdom of Guts isn't as enlightening or plentiful as that in Woodsong , an earlier Gary Paulsen memoir of wilderness life, and the stories aren't nearly as emotional, but it's a good book. I'd give it at least two and a half stars, and strongly consider the full three. Gary Paulsen created something unforgettable in his Brian's Saga books, and I have loved them. They changed me for the better, and that can't be said of most literature. We've never seen a writing talent quite like Gary Paulsen, and we are oh so lucky to have him."

The author perhaps most famous for the story Hatchet gives the reader insight into his life experiences and how they have resulted in the works that he has provided us with. Genre: Junior Biographical Critique: (a)\tThe book is provides accuracy in that he relays to the reader how his own personal experiences provided the basis for the characters in his books. The horrible things that Brian experiences in Hatchet were things that Paulsen himself experienced. All of these accounts provide an inside look into how the writings of Paulsen developed over time. (b)\tThe strongest elements of the book were the ability of Paulsen to relate his personal experiences to that of his characters as well as his ability to provide humor that also related to the stories and provided entertainment for the reader. The only negative aspect of this book is perhaps its graphic details, which could be off putting to many younger readers. (c)\tComedy is apparent in the book in a chapter that is titled “Eating Eyeballs and Guts or Starving: The Fine Art of Wilderness Nutrition.” You never know what you might have to eat to prevent starvation, and the author lets you know in very explicit detail. Curriculum Connection: This book would be a great tool for a literary unit about biographies or even as an introduction to literary units that include his books."

Spending time in school does not always equate to learning. Revolting food choices were part of life for Brian after his plane went down, but starvation pushed him to choke down edibles he wouldn't have wanted to look at in his previous life. Paulsen had high standards for the realism of Brian's Saga: \"When I set out to write the Brian books I was concerned that everything that happened to Brian should be based on reality, or as near reality as fiction could be. I did not want him to do things that wouldn't or couldn't really happen in his situation. Consequently I decided to write only of things that had happened to me or things I purposely did to make certain they would work for Brian.\" This includes the gross experiment of eating raw turtle eggs, which didn't end well for Paulsen. His commitment to authenticity in Brian's Saga was admirable, and stems from the undoubtedly finest philosophical observation in Guts , made in an earlier chapter. \"We have grown away from knowledge, away from knowing what something is really like, toward knowing only what somebody else says it is like. There seems to be a desire to ignore the truth in favor of drama.\" These words have so many practical applications, I hardly know where to begin. We outsource our religious, political, and social opinions to others who tell us how they think things are, not bothering to independently inform ourselves so we can challenge the pundits when they reason wrongly. Society has grown away from self-discovered knowledge and toward parroting the talking points of professional opinion givers, and that's not healthy. When we reject the nuance of reality in favor of black-and-white systemic ideology, we don't further education as Paulsen promotes it; we further ignorance, hampering our ability to recognize our errors of logic and reverse positions if the facts demand it. Gary Paulsen writes with uncompromising regard for truth, and that's why I love his work. Guts ends with a chapter on rudimentary cooking methods in the wild—how to heat water, make meat or fish stew, and cook using wood planks, a roasting spit, or a pot made from birch bark. It's important not to waste any part of the animals you hunt, because a next meal is never promised in the great outdoors. Paulsen concludes with an anecdote about the time he roasted buffalo meat for himself while employed as a movie production laborer, enjoying the fine meal under a starry night sky with a friend and reflecting on how it must have felt for early man to do the same every night. That started him thinking of writing a story about a modern-day kid having to survive under those conditions, and the rest, as they say, was history. The wisdom of Guts isn't as enlightening or plentiful as that in Woodsong , an earlier Gary Paulsen memoir of wilderness life, and the stories aren't nearly as emotional, but it's a good book. I'd give it at least two and a half stars, and strongly consider the full three. Gary Paulsen created something unforgettable in his Brian's Saga books, and I have loved them. They changed me for the better, and that can't be said of most literature. We've never seen a writing talent quite like Gary Paulsen, and we are oh so lucky to have him."

I remembered when I was reading it aloud to the 3rd graders and they keept asking \"is this real\"?! and I kept having to say \"yes\". that being said he does a pretty great job of tying in his experiences to the fictional texts they inspired. oh wait! dogs. there are dogs that get thrown. from the back of the plane to the front of the plane.

        "text":"Gary Paulsen is one of the authors who made me a reader. I hated reading when I was a kid, but I loved the woods. I liked survival stories and learning about nature. Hatchet was one of the few books that I actually enjoyed. After reading Hatchet a few dozen times, I moved on to the rest of Gary Paulsen’s Brian books. In Guts, Paulsen talks about the real-life events that inspired him to write the Brian series. He has lived an unusual life, mostly in remote places. He writes about his time as a paramedic in rural Colorado (very close to where I currently live). He also tells stories about surviving in the wilderness in Minnesota and Alaska. Gary Paulsen has actually lived through everything that happens in the Brian books. This memoir covers his experiences with heart failure, plane crashes, animal attacks, and hunting mishaps. Paulsen’s writing style is conversational. I read this book straight through without putting it down because it felt like I was listening to a friend tell stories. I laughed out loud several times. The author has a way of understating deadly problems that makes me laugh. Then I feel terrible about laughing at his near-death experiences. They’re funny, though! My favorite story is the one where Paulsen and his 14 sled dogs got trapped in a blizzard and needed to be rescued by plane. The dogs were loose inside the plane and lost their minds when it took off and started bouncing around in the storm. During a 20-minute flight, the dogs destroyed the plane’s interior. They bit the pilot and almost caused the plane to crash. Not cool, dogs. The moral of the story: dogs on planes know no chill. My second-favorite story is the one where Gary wanted to know if it was possible to eat turtle eggs. He tried eating one and threw up. His dog caught the puke and swallowed it before it hit the ground. Again, not cool, dogs. “We have grown away from knowledge, away from knowing what something is really like, toward knowing only what somebody else says it is like. There seems to be a desire to ignore the truth in favor of drama.” – Guts If you’re not interested in hunting or wilderness survival, then this book might not be for you, but for me, it was perfect. It’s a quick, funny read that distracted me from the rest of the world. You’d probably get the most out of Guts if you’ve read the Brian books, but it’s not completely necessary. The stories are entertaining on their own."

Naturally when they came to me the following year some were hooked on Gary Paulsen books. From time-to-time I find myself reading teen books out of habit and desire, I have a list of authors I still enjoy and Gary Paulsen is one. His books have always made me feel I was sitting listening to him tell me the story. If you have read or you know someone who has read the \"Brian\" books I would recommend this book by Paulsen. In it Mr. Paulsen explains how some of the situations Brain finds himself in are based on his own life experiences. Although I purchased the book from a school book club I would also suggest it is good reading for any of the hunters in your life. It is fascinating to read how Mr. Paulsen made his own bow and arrows, as well as, teaching himself to hunt with this homemade equipment through trial and error. Finally it is a quick read for those reluctant readers. 150 pages and not full pages of reading. Enjoy something different."

        "text":"‘Guts’ by Gary Paulsen was a considerable novel. I really liked the overall story line as well as the action packed, real life situations Gary Paulsen experienced. The book was based of a similar, well know, novel ‘Hatchet’, which Gary Paulsen wrote 15 years before publishing ‘Guts’. During the book, Paulsen describes his near-death experiences in the wilderness chapter-to-chapter making the reader feel as if they where standing right their, with him. Each chapter is based of real life events which where published in his bestseller ‘Hatchet’, but from the perspective of the main character Brain Robeson, a 13 year-old boy. One reason I really liked this book, was because of the action. Normally when you see a biography it doesn’t seem very interesting, but Gary Paulsen did an outstanding job. The book starts with a chapter called, “Heart Attacks, Plane Crashes, and Flying”. It starts by describing Gary Paulsen’s life before he was fortunate enough to become a successful writer. He lived with his wife in a small prairie town in the middle of farm country, and with so much down time, Paulsen volunteered as a medic with only a small ambulance, which was donated by the city. Gary Paulsen, being the only service available for thousands of square miles, had to witness many deaths mostly form heart attacks. And sadly, Paulsen was the only hope except for the city helicopter, which sometimes took hours to arrive. This book was a great read, and I recommend it for someone who’s looking for an easy quick-read. If theirs one thing I learned from Gary Paulsen’s life, it was that well….it took guts."

        "text":"“Guts” is a book written about the events that led up to Gary Paulsen writing about Brian Robeson’s story in the books: Hatchet, The River, Brian’s Winter, and Brian’s Return. The first chapter is about the experiences Gary has had with airplanes which is how Brian ends up in the wilderness alone in “Hatchet.” The whole book is basically about all the times Gary has had encounters in the wilderness and how he had to cope with the problems he had. The main character in “Guts” is Gary Paulsen. There are other characters but they are not as important. The story is not really written in a set place. Gary talks about all the times he is in the wilderness so you could kind of say it is taken place in the wilderness but it is never really said. It is written from the time he was a young teen to a middle age adult. The main theme in this book is determination. Gary is saying how he has had so many tough times in the wilderness and he had to be determined to make it out alive. Another theme could be creativeness because Gary has to come up with ways to cook things, and make things while he is out in the wilderness. Overall, I thought that this book was very good. I always was putting myself in Gary’s shoes asking myself what I would do. I would recommend it to people who like to read books that are written about the wild and like adventure."

Very interesting but not my cup of tea. Hunting and the wilderness do not have an appeal to me. But the stories were well told and and interesting. I did notice something in this book though. Paulsen talks often in his book about earning money for food and school clothes as a child. I am a mother and thought, \"That is great that he is helping his parents out. He is older. He must have lived during the depression.\" But other clues lead me to believe he is not that old. (He was in the army as a young man during the Korean War.) There is one sentence in the entire book in which he discusses his parents. He said that he had to hunt because his parents were in one of their drunks. His parents were drunks, did not hold jobs, and left him to fend for himself at an early age. I am impressed with what he has done with his life. Very interesting book."

I will be getting to it soon, but until then I figured I would give Guts a try, seeing how it has gotten no small praise from other accounts I read of the books. Hatchet has come up enough in falconry circles to make me curious about it, and inevitably this book came up as well. Albeit, it has nothing at all to say about falconry in it. It does reaffirm my terror of moose, though. This book consists of a series of stories that illustrate how Gary Paulsen 's own life influenced the books which he wrote. The stories are to a point rough to read - he pulls few punches in describing how difficult life in the wild can be. The fact that the stories are true adds a veneer to them that wouldn't otherwise be there. People do go through this. They survive it sometimes. Nature doesn't care about you, and it cannot be tamed or subdued. You need to have your wits about you, and an awfully strong stomach. I think this would be an excellent book to recommend to any younger kid to get them reading. I think it lends itself to kids reluctant towards reading, as it is an easy read, but also full of compelling details that draw the person in. There's plane crashes, moose attacks, deer attacks, people freezing to death and starving. There's eating gross foods - including eyeballs and turtle eggs - and hunting with a bow carved by your own hand. Who doesn't want to read such an exciting adventure?"

Gary paulsen talks about of life lessons in this book like how to hunt, fish, catch, and many other things. One of the things in the book I can see coming up soon is i feel like he is going to get attacked by a buck himself that is going to hit him really hard. The parts of this book ia ma enjoying are the parts when he is out in the woods and he is hunting and going through dangerous events like the moose hitting him off his sled and stomping on him and trying to kill him. But the one thing i do dislike about his book is that everytime he does something he has to take time and tell how it is connected to the book and it really takes the intensity and your focus away from the book. i would recommend this book to everyone of my classmates because it really gets your blood pumping when he is in intense moments like him getting attacked or him seeing something dangerous."

Paulsen's other books like Hatchet, Brian's Return, and Brian's Winter were inspired by his experiences in the wilderness. The book starts off describing his love for planes and flying, and how he came about learning to fly. He then goes on to explain some painful encounters while he was in the wilderness. The last part of the book he explains how he hunted and how he prepared- if at all- his \"food\". I thought it was a good book mainly because it was an easy read but also his style of writing is easy to follow. It was very easy to picture a paragraph of his writing in my head something that I struggle to do when reading. It's hard to pick a favorite chapter because they were all very intriguing. If I had to choose a favorite chapter it would be the Moose attack. I enjoyed it because it sounded like an awful thing to have to go through. It seemed like the moose was going for the kill; I mean who knew that Moose were so aggressive towards anything that gave them a motive. For example, he mentions how while he was training for the Iditarod he witnessed a Moose charge at a tree and absolutely demolish it until there was nothing left of it. I would recommend this book to anyone who's interested in learning some survival skills or anyone in general just because of the imagery in this book."

Like when he was starving in the forest and said that he would eat anything that would make a normal person vomit just to survive. This really painted a picture in my head of how hungry Gary was and how desperate he was for any edible substance. When Gary got attacked by the cow moose when he was riding his sled of dogs I was astonished. If I was in Gary's position I would have never believed that I would make it out alive. Just picturing getting stomped by a moose like that using Gary's words made me cringe inside. The story about Gary watching the child feed the half tamed moose at the park and how the moose freaked out when the child made him reach for the candy had me in disbelief. I couldn't imagine that a moose would stab a child it's pointed hooves just for making it reach further to get the candy. The story really showed me how crazy of a life Gary has lived. For him to live through all of these crazy stories and tell about them is really amazing."

        "text":"Due to widespread clamor among fans to hear the true stories of how Gary Paulsen gained the intimate knowledge of wilderness survival he wrote about in Hatchet and the other Brian's Saga novels, the author released Father Water, Mother Woods: Essays on Fishing and Hunting in the North Woods in the 1990s. It was well-received, but readers lobbied for more. They craved specifics about the incidents in Mr. Paulsen's life that directly inspired thirteen-year-old Brian Robeson's harrowing adventures in the Canadian bush, adventures that could easily have killed the boy before rescuers arrived. Thus Guts: The True Stories Behind Hatchet and the Brian Books was born, a memoir specifically of the events that started the author thinking about writing a novel featuring a kid forced by circumstances to survive in the wilderness, far from the comfort and protection of modern urbania. For readers who want the scoop on Hatchet , Guts has everything you could want...and more. \"The wilderness pulled at me—still does—in a way that at first baffled me and then became a wonder for me.\" — Guts , P. 71 Gary Paulsen led a life of more variety than almost anyone, and volunteer paramedic in the Colorado boondocks was among his myriad occupations. As the only first responder close enough to react meaningfully in an emergency, Paulsen bore responsibility for the lives of many. This was where he learned about heart attacks, the most common malady of patients he was called to help. Paulsen could do nothing to save the majority of myocardial infarction victims, and one death that happened right in front of him haunted the author long after, coming through in Brian's experience with the pilot of his small plane who suffered a heart attack and died while their vehicle was airborne. As a paramedic and as an officer in the U.S. military, Paulsen also witnessed numerous plane crashes, some fatal but most not, and had a scare while on tour for his 1986 Newbery Honor book Dogsong when the engine of the small plane he was a passenger in sputtered and died. The pilot landed without any problem, but the helplessness of hanging 3,000 feet up in the air in a plane that had no engine would inform Brian's panicked response when the same thing happened to him with dire consequences. Another life-or-death situation involving a small plane saw an intrepid bush pilot flying into an insane winter storm in Alaska to rescue Paulsen and his sled dogs during the Iditarod. The incident leaves an indelible impression even as the scene it sets is downright comical. By the time Paulsen was honorably discharged from the military and had trained to earn his pilot's license, he was well on his way to knowing enough to write intelligently about Brian's plane crash. Bizarre animal assaults play a pivotal role in Brian's Saga, from rampaging moose to hungry bears, from surly skunks to monstrous swarms of mosquitos. Paulsen relates anecdotes about his own encounters with these assailants and more, but the most memorable may be when a massive cow moose waylaid him on a stormy night in the Alaskan bush. The attack was unprovoked and nightmarishly prolonged, as attacks feel when blow after vicious blow is hurting us and there's nothing we can do to stop it. The moose had Paulsen facedown in the snow and would not relent from stomping on him, bloodying the helpless musher and cracking his bones. \"She completely worked me over. I didn't count the kicks and stomps but there were dozens. She stopped after a bit and I peeked at her, outlined against the snow, and she was staring at me, listening for my breath, and when at last I could hold it no longer and had to breathe again she heard it and renewed the attack. I don't know how long she kept after me. It seemed hours, days. I lay as still as possible, trying to hide my breathing, but she kept coming back until I thought I was dead—and then she backed off. Thinking she was gone, I tried a small move, but she jumped me again. Finally I think she was convinced I was finished and she moved off into the forest.\" Sometimes all you can do when you're assaulted that way is curl up in a trembling little ball and hope to survive, and that's how Paulsen (and Brian) lived through their run-ins with lunatic moose. The only way to endure in a world that threatens your existence is to adapt and learn from its painful lessons, to not make serious mistakes twice. \"The solution to facing all these dangers, a solution that came very rapidly to me and to Brian, is knowledge. It can come from anywhere; from reading, from listening to people or from personal experience. However it comes, the knowledge must be there.\" Accumulating wisdom is the way to fend off danger whether you're in the wilderness or the safety of suburbia, which presents its own perils. Learning to avoid pitfalls is a trait possessed by every survivor. Brian's ability to stay alive in the bush hinged on fashioning functional hunting weapons with no one to teach him how, and Paulsen recounts his own experiences in this area. Crafting a usable bow and arrows from wood is hard work, and learning to hunt with them is more difficult still, but Paulsen and Brian each eventually did. The process requires attention to detail, and the author doesn't scrimp on explaining how to carve the wood and arrows just right. If the feathers aren't the proper shape and style, your arrows won't fly accurately. Once you make a kill, you have to clean and cook the animal, and that's at least as much work as carving handmade weapons. Paulsen relates his long, arduous journey after killing his first deer with a bow and arrow as a fifteen-year-old, dragging the dead buck that weighed more than him miles from the scene of the hunt to where he'd stashed his bicycle. It's hard to imagine how he biked four miles home while attempting to keep two hundred pounds of dead deer in balance, but Paulsen at that age was already adapting to the ways of nature, learning to be inconspicuous and predict what would happen next in the drama of the natural world around him. He knew it was essential to never stop growing and improving. \"To learn, to be willing to learn how a thing works, to understand an animal in nature, or how to write a book or run a dog team or sail a boat, to always keep learning is truly wonderful.\" This from someone who was not a diligent student in school, but had a passion to learn from nature the grand truths of life that school teachers rarely address. Spending time in school does not always equate to learning. Revolting food choices were part of life for Brian after his plane went down, but starvation pushed him to choke down edibles he wouldn't have wanted to look at in his previous life. Paulsen had high standards for the realism of Brian's Saga: \"When I set out to write the Brian books I was concerned that everything that happened to Brian should be based on reality, or as near reality as fiction could be. I did not want him to do things that wouldn't or couldn't really happen in his situation. Consequently I decided to write only of things that had happened to me or things I purposely did to make certain they would work for Brian.\" This includes the gross experiment of eating raw turtle eggs, which didn't end well for Paulsen. His commitment to authenticity in Brian's Saga was admirable, and stems from the undoubtedly finest philosophical observation in Guts , made in an earlier chapter. \"We have grown away from knowledge, away from knowing what something is really like, toward knowing only what somebody else says it is like. There seems to be a desire to ignore the truth in favor of drama.\" These words have so many practical applications, I hardly know where to begin. We outsource our religious, political, and social opinions to others who tell us how they think things are, not bothering to independently inform ourselves so we can challenge the pundits when they reason wrongly. Society has grown away from self-discovered knowledge and toward parroting the talking points of professional opinion givers, and that's not healthy. When we reject the nuance of reality in favor of black-and-white systemic ideology, we don't further education as Paulsen promotes it; we further ignorance, hampering our ability to recognize our errors of logic and reverse positions if the facts demand it. Gary Paulsen writes with uncompromising regard for truth, and that's why I love his work. Guts ends with a chapter on rudimentary cooking methods in the wild—how to heat water, make meat or fish stew, and cook using wood planks, a roasting spit, or a pot made from birch bark. It's important not to waste any part of the animals you hunt, because a next meal is never promised in the great outdoors. Paulsen concludes with an anecdote about the time he roasted buffalo meat for himself while employed as a movie production laborer, enjoying the fine meal under a starry night sky with a friend and reflecting on how it must have felt for early man to do the same every night. That started him thinking of writing a story about a modern-day kid having to survive under those conditions, and the rest, as they say, was history. The wisdom of Guts isn't as enlightening or plentiful as that in Woodsong , an earlier Gary Paulsen memoir of wilderness life, and the stories aren't nearly as emotional, but it's a good book. I'd give it at least two and a half stars, and strongly consider the full three. Gary Paulsen created something unforgettable in his Brian's Saga books, and I have loved them. They changed me for the better, and that can't be said of most literature. We've never seen a writing talent quite like Gary Paulsen, and we are oh so lucky to have him."

Since he parents were poor they couldn't afford much food so Gary went out by himself armed with a bow to come back with dinner. He had to provide for himself completely with working multiple jobs to afford school clothes. Then as he got older and got out of hunting he went to also to race dogs and sleigh. Hes won multiple races but the main thing he remembered from also is all the mosses. He said hes been attacked by multiple mosses.

        "text":"Summary: This is a biography by Gary Paulsen where he shares information about his life experiences, comedic anecdotes that relates to the stories he has written, and events that provided inspiration for many of his stories. The author perhaps most famous for the story Hatchet gives the reader insight into his life experiences and how they have resulted in the works that he has provided us with. Genre: Junior Biographical Critique: (a)\tThe book is provides accuracy in that he relays to the reader how his own personal experiences provided the basis for the characters in his books. The horrible things that Brian experiences in Hatchet were things that Paulsen himself experienced. All of these accounts provide an inside look into how the writings of Paulsen developed over time. (b)\tThe strongest elements of the book were the ability of Paulsen to relate his personal experiences to that of his characters as well as his ability to provide humor that also related to the stories and provided entertainment for the reader. The only negative aspect of this book is perhaps its graphic details, which could be off putting to many younger readers. (c)\tComedy is apparent in the book in a chapter that is titled “Eating Eyeballs and Guts or Starving: The Fine Art of Wilderness Nutrition.” You never know what you might have to eat to prevent starvation, and the author lets you know in very explicit detail. Curriculum Connection: This book would be a great tool for a literary unit about biographies or even as an introduction to literary units that include his books."

Peck's bracing philippic proposes that contemporary literature is at a dead end. Novelists have forfeited a wider audience, succumbing to identity politicking and self-reflexive postmodernism. In the torrent of responses to this fulguration, opinions were not so much divided as cleaved in two with, for example, Carlin Romano contending that \"Peck's judgments are worse than nasty―they are hysterical\" and Benjamin Schwarz retorting that \"in his meticulous attention to diction, his savage wit, his exact and rollicking prose and his disdain for pseudointellectual flatulence, Dale Peck is Mencken's heir.\" Hatchet Jobs includes swinging critiques of the work of, among others, Sven Birkerts, Julian Barnes, Philip Roth, Colson Whitehead, Jim Crace, Stanley Crouch, and Rick Moody.",

        "text":"This is a companion piece to A Reader's Manifesto: An Attack on the Growing Pretentiousness in American Literary Prose , taking swipe at modern writers and arguing that inn many cases their exalted status is undeserved. It is longer than Myers and tends to group writers as representative of a feted group rather than deal with them individually. As such there is little overlap although if you are Don DeLillo or Rick Moody you must be questioning your life choices right now. Peck’s approach is more chatty, more humorous and while it can seem less scholarly, less intellectually rigorous and easier to read the insight and understanding of literature is no less than Myers and it is Peck’s skill to furnish his mental acuity with accessibility. It is worth reading even if you have very little interest in literature for the cutting comments he peppers the book with, the type you wish you yourself had the wit to make. His take-down of Birkerts My Sky Blue Trades: Growing Up Counter in a Contrary Time is stored in my memory just waiting to be used in the right situation, “Birkets …isn’t re-viewing his life in MSBT, he’s reviewing it in much the same way he reviews fiction, telling his readers what thy can learn from the text of his life. This sort of pedagogy would be dull from just about anyone, but coming form someone who seems to have done a little bit less than the average man of his day…it was particularly boring.” Like Myers he addresses some of the issues that plagued me working in a bookshop – one being if you have a separate gay fiction section you’re effectively cutting out a large swathe of the buying market. It’s not even a deliberate decision, I’ve never read Alan Hollinghurst largely because he has been put on the Gay section shelf and that is not somewhere I’d look. He takes issue with authors who try to deal with societal issues yet only populate their novels with gay characters. Gay fiction and literature that has gay protagonists are different beasts and yet there is a clamour to see them as the same. I could not help but think of my most hated book, A Little Life when he talks of the current trend for gay epics where the epicdom derives “Not from depth of thought but depth-of-book, measured not in pages but inches.” His critique of Like People in History articulates exactly why I hated Yanagihara’s work so much. Both books start with a depressing premise – child abuse or AIDS and shows a main character who suffers but is also so insufferable to everyone around them and both authors duck explaining why anyone is attracted to these emotional black holes. Both run through a series of gimmicks where the events become increasingly horrific and decreasingly believable. Again Peck casts a final killer blow when having revealed the final boss of gimmicks – that a main character, who just happens to be a repeat winner of Mr Gay America, is the offspring of two parents with Down syndrome, ” The threesome [the parents and the son’s lover] have an extended conversation on homosexuality, AIDS and the myth of Achilles and Patroclus, all conducted in a five-year-old’s English , which seems to be a sort of lowest-common-denominator approach to both narrative and morality. In a book already groaning with gimmicks…it backfires because the words and ideas Matt’s retarded parents use are no less sophisticated than those used anywhere else [in the book].” Ouch! Peck then moves on to the power of marketing to package bad books through grouping them as a literary movement. He takes to task three contemporary black women writers who all have ridden the tails of the movement and lack anything fresh or worthwhile. His discussion of Precious by Sapphire highlights how it is in many ways the same skeleton as the gay epics just with a different skin. Again the list of tribulations heaped upon Precious seems more like a shopping list and so loses impact. ”Precious is kicked out of school for her behaviour problems and because she can’t read (it’s not her fault, she’s got troubles, and besides, she’s dyslexic too); then finally she learns she’s HIV positive. Still these tragedies are somehow contextualised…by the fact that Precious is taught to read by a lesbian named Blue Rain. All told, Sapphire has written a slim piece of propaganda designed to deliver the novel message that father-daughter rape is a bad thing and literacy a good thing.” Sapphire also falls into the trap of not knowing how to give voice to her character. She has her speaking in an uneducated , grammatically incorrect slang, yet we know she has educated herself. If she is writing it before education that’s false as she was illiterate and if she is writing it from a future place where she has educated herself why is she using the language of her past giving the book a false naivete. This is the heart of Peck’s argument, that laziness has been rewarded not through talent but purely by fitting the current requirements in the identity politics market. In case you think this book just serves to give a kicking to marginalised groups, Peck directs his steel toe-caps to the lauded old, white men of literature. He has no time for Julian Barnes describing a lot of his work as, “harmless drivel, but it doesn’t explain why Barnes’ writing crawls under your skin and itches like scabies.” and when he quotes sections like the following you have to concede the point even if it is harshly made, ”We are all, are we not, lost. Those who know it not are the more lost. Those who do know it are found, for they have grasped their full lostness.” His issue with Jim Crace is very much like Myers problem with much of modern literature, that in lieu of anything profound to say on the big subjects the smallness of life, the insignificant is imbued with a depth that is undeserving and inappropriate. My point is not that Crace’s new book is bad, but rather that in its exclusively banal view of life, death, sex and art in its solemn pseudominimalist belief that any trivial detail, earnestly presented, is filled with significance, and in its reference-librarian’s elevation of facts to totems, it is so bad that I began to suspect that he might actually have talent.” Peck continues the mauling of Rick Moody where Myers left off. “ …If I follow his reasoning, which can be difficult since it proceeds primarily by rhythm and evocation rather than logic, then this book is meant to tell us what that sin is. By the time I finished reading, I was convinced the book was the sin. …To be an American, Moody writes in one of the few syntactically lucid sentences in the book (unfortunately its also the third to last)… The conclusion arrived at is the same as Myers. That contemporary literary fiction is weak because, “ they write for one another rather than some more or less common reader. Their prose shares a showiness that speaks of solidarity and competition…falsely intellectual.” Where did it all go wrong you may ask. Peck blames Joyce, citing Portrait of the Artist as the chapter by chapter unravelling of a talent and Ulysses as, “nothing more than a hoax upon literature, a joint shenanigan of the author and the critical establishment…” Having read neither I cannot offer an opinion other than to say I have never been interested in reading either because I think deep in my literary instinct I have long suspected it to be the case. Peck is a brilliant critic, a deep understanding of literature and the ability to critique it in a persuasive and entertaining way. If you’ve been toying with whether to kill your literary darlings, save your energy, Peck has already got to them with his keen-edged axe."

Here goes Day 1: Favorite book Bad start - there's no such animal. But let's say Ulysses. Day 2: Least favorite book Oh, I know this one - American Psycho. But Topping from Below runs it close second. Day 3: Book that makes you laugh out loud The Innocent Anthropologist by Nigel Barley will do. Also Trainspotting, Irvine Welsh. Day 4: Book that makes you cry Such a Long Journey, Rohinton Mistry Day 5: Book you wish you could live in The Fermata by Nicholson Baker but only if I could be the despicable Arno Strine. Day 6: Favorite young adult book Titus Groan Day 7: Book that you can quote\/recite Both Incredible String Band songbooks and a bit of Beautiful Losers (Leonard Cohen). Also bits of the Bible. Day 8: Book that scares you American Psycho - it scares me that reasonably intelligent people can think that it's satire and that makes it okay Day 9: Book that makes you sick So many, so many, but let's go for The Protocols of the Elders of Zion, a bit obvious I know. The Mad Man by Samuel Delaney was fairly trying too. Topping from below, of course - the dog scene was a classic. Day 10: Book that changed your life Something Wicked this way Comes by Ray Bradbury. Day 11: Book from your favorite author I suppose Rohinton Mistry is my current favourite author, so A Fine Balance. Day 12: Book that is most like your life In terms of job, and not having read it but read about it, Microserfs by Douglas Coupland. Day 13: Book whose main character is most like you The Bible Part Two (aka New testament) - Doubting Thomas Day 14: Book whose main character you want to marry The Crimson Petal and the White - Sugar - she's so nice - except she turns into a same sex oriented person eventually. So that would be like Ross in Friends. So perhaps not. Okay - I know - Kate from The Country Girls (Edna O'Brien) - she's hilarious and in my mind she's a knockout too. Day 15: First “chapter book” you can remember reading as a child Er - huh? Meaning not a picture book? I think it would be one of the many William books. Day 16: Longest book you’ve read The Quincunx. Day 17: Shortest book you’ve read What a silly question - the shortest book I currently have is Giving Up by Jillian Becker which is about the last week in the life of Sylvia Plath - 48 pages. Big print too. Day 18: Book you’re most embarrassed to say you like True crime , all the way! Hell Ranch! Day 19: Book that turned you on Sigh - do I have to answer this? - no? Okay, next - Day 20: Book you’ve read the most number of times The Circus of Dr Lao by Charles Finney Day 21: Favorite picture book from childhood None, I was very deprived Day 22: Book you plan to read next The Time of our Singing, maybe. Day 23: Book you tell people you’ve read, but haven’t (or haven’t actually finished) As if! What do you take me for! Day 24: Book that contains your favorite scene This is a stupid question - favourite scene? Well, I did think the involuntary Bobbitting of the boyfriend scene in The World According to Garp was extremely memorable. Day 25: Favorite book you read in school Can't remember. Day 26: Favorite nonfiction book The Earth from the Air. Day 27: Favorite fiction book Too many to mention. Day 28: Last book you read Topping from Below Day 29: Book you’re currently reading All Hell Let Loose Day 30: Favorite coffee table book Victorian Painting, Lionel Lambourne ** Wow, that was kind of boring - I could think of better questions than those. Anyone care to do the PB Goodreads Instant Challenge? What's the author you most recently wanted to kill? What's your favourite book cover? What's the ugliest book cover you've seen recently? What's the most ridiculous place you've ever tried to read? Who's the sexiest author? Why do you despair at the state of the contemporary novel? What would YOU have given the Booker to, since you say all the actual winners are such crap? What's the last thing you found squashed between the pages of a book?

        "text":"Here we have Dale Peck doing the fish slapping dance with a few of his literary contemporaries, and I love it. They have to stand there rigid and appearing to be unconcerned while sprightly Dale hops around, derides them horribly, and slaps their chops with a large haddock. I would give this book 5 stars, but mostly, Dale is beating up on authors I haven't read and - now! - have no intention of reading, so it's mostly somebody else's (beautifully invectivised) argument. The authors here dissected, filleted and grossly insulted who I never read are : Sven Birkerts Colson Whitehead Jamaica Kincaid Terry McMillan Jim Crace Stanley Crouch Rick Moody and the ones I have read are DFW Kurt Vonnegut Julian Barnes Sapphire Philip Roth So I guess this is the hipster version of B R Myers' A Reader's Manifesto which denounced certain American literary authors for their pretensions and general wanky unreadability. Here's Dale speaking generally : even taking into consideration the theory that cinematic and virtual media have displaced the printed word as the dominant narrative form and that the novel and its grown-too-big-for-its-britches sibling, the memoir, are only occasionally profitable anachronisms; even recognising that literary standards and technological advances have made it theoretically feasible for just about anyone to write and publish a book [Dale was writing in 2004] - even considering all these factors, the number of Stepford novels that are written, published, reviewed, and read every year is completely out of control. .... Blame the writing programs and the prize committees, blame the deconstructionist literary critics or the back-patting Siamese-twinned professions of writing and reviewing fiction, blame any or all of the identity communities who read and write those ethnic-or-gender-marketed booster books or blame the dead white European males who forced us to resort to Literature as our Daily Affirmation in the first place. And here's a flavour of his specific charges - first, against Stanley Crouch : Crouch is neither virtuosic nor possessed of good marksmanship; he's just another demagogue in an age that confuses demagoguery with honesty; a black man who uses the veil of anti-pc polemic to make criticisms of black culture that white Americans are either too cowed or too smart to put forth themselves... suffice it to say that here is one black man calling other black men monkeys, denying blackness to those African Americans who fail to live up to his standards and conferring it on those who do. ... Don't the Moon Look Lonesome is a terrible novel, badly conceived, badly executed, and put forward in bad faith... and now David Foster Wallace : What makes Infinite Jest's success even more noteworthy is that it is, in a word, terrible. Other words I might use include bloated, boring, gratuitous and - perhaps especially - uncontrolled. I would, in fact, go so far as to say that infinite Jest is one of the very few novels for which the phrase \"not worth the paper it's printed on\" has real meaning at least in an ecological sense; but to resort to such hyperbole would be to fall into the rut that characterizes many reviews of this novel... I resent the five weeks of my life I gave over to reading the thing; I resent every endlessly over-elaborated gag in the book, like a ten-page riff on why video telephones are unviable, or the dozen pages on the teenager who won all his tennis matches by playing with a pistol held to his head, or the thousands and thousands and thousands of words devoted to pharmaceutical trivia on all sorts of mind-altering drugs.... I could, a la Edward Said, accuseWallace of cultural colonialism in the peppering of his otherwise exclusively white male text with exoticized African-Americans, women, and homosexuals, and, further, I think the case can be made that the narrative technique Wallace has derived from Pynchon is nothing more than a watered-down de(homo)-eroticized style that lives on Sontag's \"barren edge of Camp\". You may not agree with Dale, but I still recommed his book, because for some of us bookish types, it's the nearest thing to a bracing walk in a drench of freezing rain on a cliff path with crumbly edges and no guard rail."

        "text":"At a New York literary event in 2005, Richard Ford, the American fiction aristocrat, stepped up to Colson Whitehead and spat on him. Whitehead, the author of two novels and an emerging African-American voice of some importance, had reviewed Ford's A Multitude of Sins in the New York Times, attributing to it failings in the nature of self-absorption, incompleteness and 'whining.' The incident, as reported in New York Magazine, was just part of a debate over book reviewing that's raging among the literati. Its value as a cultural performance is being questioned, as is its purported pirating by the so-called 'snark' school of reviewers. Two years ago the novelist Heidi Julavits confessed in an interview that while reading reviews of her first book ‘… the tiniest little criticisms in it, and I would be completely under the table for three days.’ She thus set off on a crusade to make literary comment more sensitive, helping launch a new magazine, The Believer; so named, she infers, in the spirit of vanquishing the ‘unbelievers’. Writing in the debut issue Julavits minted the ‘snark’ label for that cadre of nattering nabobs of literary negativism and proclaimed a yearning for a literary culture that supports ‘ambition’. A number of darlings of the publishing world—Dave Eggars, Jonathan Franzen, and Zadie Smith among them—caught up in the notion of this odd immunity-from-literary-prosecution cult, have jumped aboard the seemingly irony-free anti-snark freedom train. Though physical conflict in literary circles is no new thing—Norman Mailer and Gore Vidal haven’t sat close at a dinner party since the nineteen-sixties—the current strain of book-notice venom is felt by many to be more pernicious than ever. Even the snarkers are at each other: Dale Peck, in his splendid new book Hatchet Jobs: Writings on Contemporary Fiction, says of Whitehead’s novel John Henry Days: ‘…(the author’s) ambitions are so vast they seemed to have snowed readers into confusing intended with actual product.’ So far there is no word on Whitehead’s intentions for expectorate vengeance upon Dale Peck. Is all this just a tempest in a Starbuck’s? Should fragile people be writers or vice versa? Should a negative review be a spittle-firing squad offence? Hard to say, sensitivity being universally understood as essential to artistry. But oblivious to whatever damage might come to the egos of his targets or to his own reputation, over the past eight years or so Dale Peck has been leading the charge for what seems to me, having read a number of the authors under his mention, some kind of truth in reviewing. Though on record as being interested only in advancing the art of fiction, Peck here stands as a voice for the reading audience out there who expect a positively-reviewed book of literary fiction to at least be readable, if not entertaining in some way. Hatchet Jobs configures seventeen of Peck’s most erudite reviews into a persuasive anti-pretension polemic. On the firing line are writers such as Rick Moody (…the worst writer of his generation); David Foster Wallace (…proof that the Great American Hype Machine can still work wonders); Jim Crace (…everything I despise about contemporary fiction.); and Julian Barnes (…crawls under your skin and itches like rabies). Snark reviews might simply seem nasty to the average not-looking-for-trouble-reader out there, but Peck notes a distinct damping down of excitement in fiction over the past few years. Among other complaints, he notes an over-dependence upon family history to stand in for and sometimes interfere with actual storytelling (see comments re autobiography below), and the artless application of personal philosophy, sans conceit, thick onto the page. Peck cites Stanley Crouch’s Don’t The Moon Look Lonesome, and The Autobiography of My Mother, by Jamaica Kincaid, as particularly so afflicted. But by the tenor of the mainstream reviews, Peck points out, these pat books might be works of genius. Thus it is not just authors he is after, but critics, who are—as in the past and even more in this age of vocational multitasking—often one and the same. He snorts: ‘…as over-rated and misguided as most of our celebrated novelists are, it seems to me that the fault isn’t entirely theirs, but must be vested to some degree in those who praise them for their efforts.’ Peck strives thus to deflate the puffery of the pretentious, the exclusion-ism of a literary-intellectual cult whose recent efforts have tended to partition general readership from the exalted personages of discernment (i.e. themselves). He sneers at the …pseudo-intellectual artists and critics who think their love of books translates into some kind of knowledge….Chances are they will alienate more and more readers from all fiction. In castigating the novelist\/critic Sven Birkets, whose critical screeds Peck believes aspire vastly beyond the author’s capabilities, he lashes: …with friends like this, literature needs an enema. When fiction is not the subject, Peck takes on those ‘veterans’ of one or two books, mainly writing program grads younger than fifty, with the temerity to be penning exhaustive, finely-facted autobiographies. Peck dismisses Birkets’ My Sky Blue Trades, thusly: …dull from just about anyone, but coming from someone who seems to have done a little bit less than the average man of his day…it was particularly boring. Hatchet Jobs is written with a thoroughgoing aplomb and in a spirit of entertainment no doubt vastly more engaging than the works being discussed. As a novelist himself, Peck is obviously self-interested in promoting the purchase, reading and enjoyment of fiction. And amid the jabs, cuts and slams, it is clear by his extensive research that he fully expects to be examined himself. For every dull book he is paid to read, Peck force-marches himself through the author’s oeuvre, slapping himself alert over many hundreds of doze-inducing pages, just in case there might have been something worthwhile earlier on. He then discusses the work in near excessive detail; these reviews are journal pieces, usually published in places where books are the general subject. They run to quite un-newspaperly lengths, usually three thousands words, some far longer. Though the book is full of biting reductions, Hatchet Jobs is not all nastiness. Almost touching is Peck’s consideration of the fallen career of Kurt Vonnegut; the cult-meister’s albatross-like curse of trying to follow himself; the emptiness of his later fiction. This is a book written so well that it can be enjoyed even if you haven’t read any of the works addressed. If Dale Peck can be critically checked at all in this effort it would be in the choosing of his targets. By the sampling offered in Hatchet Jobs, it is clear he has given the up-and-comers most of his ink; eschewing, or perhaps simply not being assigned, terrific American writers like style-maker Cormac McCarthy, genre-breaker James Elroy, urban-cool master Don DeLillo, or first novelist Charles Frazier, whose Cold Mountain would have blown off Peck’s drowsiness in just a few sentences."

Several of the targets of Peck's criticism (I'm looking at you Sven Birkerts and Stanley Crouch) are overdue for a take-down and, uncharitable blowhards themselves, they'll get no crocodile tears from me. But the net result of reading these relentlessly nasty reviews in a collection was a dislike of Dale Peck that grew with each essay. I guess it's like comic relief in a thriller - the funny parts make the scary parts scarier. Similarly, a little generosity in a critic makes harsh critical judgments seem a little more righteous. The unmixed bile on offer here is a disagreeable read. Peck's self-pitying complaints to the contrary, no one is trying to 'silence' him by labeling him a bitch. His bitchy tone assaults anyone with a metaphorical ear. Straw silencers, be damned! Peck can defend the still-beating heart of literature (his actual image, I kid you not*) with all the catty poison at his command. He may be the very soul of literary rectitude, but I don't like his company and I won't be spending any more time with him. There's entirely too much else to read out there. *For someone with such sniffy, Brahminical sensibilities, Peck's own writing is replete with howlers like this in addition to appalling freshman comp mistakes such as subject\/verb disagreement.

None of the authors I have chosen to read are on the 'giants' list - at least four of my novels were not originally written in English (I am reading them in translation) so my comparison may be flawed - but even if I replaced those novels with ones written in English I know my list would still not contain any of the 'giants'. Indeed I am sure that amongst the 3,000 odd 'want to read' books I have listed on GoodReads none of the 'giants' appear. I mention all this because I approached this book with some wariness because of my ignorance of so much of the 'contemporary literature' that literary critics regard as important. I needn't have worried - previously I had only Know Mr. Peck as a marvelous novelist; now I respect and admire him for demolishing so many sacred cows and laying bare the dead end road that so much contemporary literature is on. Absolutely well worth reading - I adored what he had to say about Felice Picano's 'Like People in History' and Ethan Morden's 'How Long has this Been Going On' (just in case you imagined it was only SWM (straight white men) that he was knocking off their pedestals) and I wish I could demolition overblown mediocre writing with such style and perception."

Myers' A READER'S MANIFESTO and I agree, but I still enjoy Peck's eviscerations of what passes for contemporary American literature. (The one recent book he discusses that I've read, Sven Birkerts' GUTENBERG ELEGIES, I liked more than he did but I have no problem taking his word for how awful most of the others are.) In my view, Peck runs into trouble when he attempts a deeper analysis of what went wrong with fiction, making James Joyce his pet villain. Seems Joyce (so says Peck) showed real promise when he wrote \"The Dead\" but then darn it, he got self-indulgent and blew it with A PORTRAIT and ULYSSES. Peck ignores, or misses, some key points here, such as (A) Joyce wrote only four works of fiction, so rather than having a lot of works to deal with, his readers have a few works to deal with, albeit works that must be dealt with intensely if one is to understand them at all. (B) With Joyce, it's \"in for a penny, in for a pound.\" If you don't want to spend a lot of time on critical thinking you should read other writers. (C) No one had to be influenced by Joyce who didn't want to be. And of course, (D)It's not Joyce's fault if later writers weren't, or aren't as good as he was. Peck is a born hatchet man and that's fine, as long as he doesn't try to be a constructive critic."

So I was hoping that I would learn more about why I hate most novels published within the last few years. Unfortunately these essays are mostly bitter, mean, and stupid, which is a shame, because many of them contain well-reasoned investigations of various authors. The best essay was, to me, a sort of elegy for Kurt Vonnegut (which is strange, because he wasn't dead when this was published). I completely agreed with most of Dale Peck's assessment of Vonnegut, whose characters grapple with the futility of free will in the face of a chaotic and indifferent universe. Peck makes the point that Vonnegut's early novels contain \"tragic heroes\" who refuse to accept the absurdity of their existences, whereas in his later novels his main (often autobiographical) characters mostly surrender to either absurdity or death. Which effectively renders them (and him) impotent. Also, Sapphire got a half a million advance for Push ? Seriously?"

        "text":"This is a companion piece to A Reader's Manifesto: An Attack on the Growing Pretentiousness in American Literary Prose , taking swipe at modern writers and arguing that inn many cases their exalted status is undeserved. It is longer than Myers and tends to group writers as representative of a feted group rather than deal with them individually. As such there is little overlap although if you are Don DeLillo or Rick Moody you must be questioning your life choices right now. Peck’s approach is more chatty, more humorous and while it can seem less scholarly, less intellectually rigorous and easier to read the insight and understanding of literature is no less than Myers and it is Peck’s skill to furnish his mental acuity with accessibility. It is worth reading even if you have very little interest in literature for the cutting comments he peppers the book with, the type you wish you yourself had the wit to make. His take-down of Birkerts My Sky Blue Trades: Growing Up Counter in a Contrary Time is stored in my memory just waiting to be used in the right situation, “Birkets …isn’t re-viewing his life in MSBT, he’s reviewing it in much the same way he reviews fiction, telling his readers what thy can learn from the text of his life. This sort of pedagogy would be dull from just about anyone, but coming form someone who seems to have done a little bit less than the average man of his day…it was particularly boring.” Like Myers he addresses some of the issues that plagued me working in a bookshop – one being if you have a separate gay fiction section you’re effectively cutting out a large swathe of the buying market. It’s not even a deliberate decision, I’ve never read Alan Hollinghurst largely because he has been put on the Gay section shelf and that is not somewhere I’d look. He takes issue with authors who try to deal with societal issues yet only populate their novels with gay characters. Gay fiction and literature that has gay protagonists are different beasts and yet there is a clamour to see them as the same. I could not help but think of my most hated book, A Little Life when he talks of the current trend for gay epics where the epicdom derives “Not from depth of thought but depth-of-book, measured not in pages but inches.” His critique of Like People in History articulates exactly why I hated Yanagihara’s work so much. Both books start with a depressing premise – child abuse or AIDS and shows a main character who suffers but is also so insufferable to everyone around them and both authors duck explaining why anyone is attracted to these emotional black holes. Both run through a series of gimmicks where the events become increasingly horrific and decreasingly believable. Again Peck casts a final killer blow when having revealed the final boss of gimmicks – that a main character, who just happens to be a repeat winner of Mr Gay America, is the offspring of two parents with Down syndrome, ” The threesome [the parents and the son’s lover] have an extended conversation on homosexuality, AIDS and the myth of Achilles and Patroclus, all conducted in a five-year-old’s English , which seems to be a sort of lowest-common-denominator approach to both narrative and morality. In a book already groaning with gimmicks…it backfires because the words and ideas Matt’s retarded parents use are no less sophisticated than those used anywhere else [in the book].” Ouch! Peck then moves on to the power of marketing to package bad books through grouping them as a literary movement. He takes to task three contemporary black women writers who all have ridden the tails of the movement and lack anything fresh or worthwhile. His discussion of Precious by Sapphire highlights how it is in many ways the same skeleton as the gay epics just with a different skin. Again the list of tribulations heaped upon Precious seems more like a shopping list and so loses impact. ”Precious is kicked out of school for her behaviour problems and because she can’t read (it’s not her fault, she’s got troubles, and besides, she’s dyslexic too); then finally she learns she’s HIV positive. Still these tragedies are somehow contextualised…by the fact that Precious is taught to read by a lesbian named Blue Rain. All told, Sapphire has written a slim piece of propaganda designed to deliver the novel message that father-daughter rape is a bad thing and literacy a good thing.” Sapphire also falls into the trap of not knowing how to give voice to her character. She has her speaking in an uneducated , grammatically incorrect slang, yet we know she has educated herself. If she is writing it before education that’s false as she was illiterate and if she is writing it from a future place where she has educated herself why is she using the language of her past giving the book a false naivete. This is the heart of Peck’s argument, that laziness has been rewarded not through talent but purely by fitting the current requirements in the identity politics market. In case you think this book just serves to give a kicking to marginalised groups, Peck directs his steel toe-caps to the lauded old, white men of literature. He has no time for Julian Barnes describing a lot of his work as, “harmless drivel, but it doesn’t explain why Barnes’ writing crawls under your skin and itches like scabies.” and when he quotes sections like the following you have to concede the point even if it is harshly made, ”We are all, are we not, lost. Those who know it not are the more lost. Those who do know it are found, for they have grasped their full lostness.” His issue with Jim Crace is very much like Myers problem with much of modern literature, that in lieu of anything profound to say on the big subjects the smallness of life, the insignificant is imbued with a depth that is undeserving and inappropriate. My point is not that Crace’s new book is bad, but rather that in its exclusively banal view of life, death, sex and art in its solemn pseudominimalist belief that any trivial detail, earnestly presented, is filled with significance, and in its reference-librarian’s elevation of facts to totems, it is so bad that I began to suspect that he might actually have talent.” Peck continues the mauling of Rick Moody where Myers left off. “ …If I follow his reasoning, which can be difficult since it proceeds primarily by rhythm and evocation rather than logic, then this book is meant to tell us what that sin is. By the time I finished reading, I was convinced the book was the sin. …To be an American, Moody writes in one of the few syntactically lucid sentences in the book (unfortunately its also the third to last)… The conclusion arrived at is the same as Myers. That contemporary literary fiction is weak because, “ they write for one another rather than some more or less common reader. Their prose shares a showiness that speaks of solidarity and competition…falsely intellectual.” Where did it all go wrong you may ask. Peck blames Joyce, citing Portrait of the Artist as the chapter by chapter unravelling of a talent and Ulysses as, “nothing more than a hoax upon literature, a joint shenanigan of the author and the critical establishment…” Having read neither I cannot offer an opinion other than to say I have never been interested in reading either because I think deep in my literary instinct I have long suspected it to be the case. Peck is a brilliant critic, a deep understanding of literature and the ability to critique it in a persuasive and entertaining way. If you’ve been toying with whether to kill your literary darlings, save your energy, Peck has already got to them with his keen-edged axe."

The Mad Man by Samuel Delaney was fairly trying too. Topping from below, of course - the dog scene was a classic. Day 10: Book that changed your life Something Wicked this way Comes by Ray Bradbury. Day 11: Book from your favorite author I suppose Rohinton Mistry is my current favourite author, so A Fine Balance. Day 12: Book that is most like your life In terms of job, and not having read it but read about it, Microserfs by Douglas Coupland. Day 13: Book whose main character is most like you The Bible Part Two (aka New testament) - Doubting Thomas Day 14: Book whose main character you want to marry The Crimson Petal and the White - Sugar - she's so nice - except she turns into a same sex oriented person eventually. So that would be like Ross in Friends. So perhaps not. Okay - I know - Kate from The Country Girls (Edna O'Brien) - she's hilarious and in my mind she's a knockout too. Day 15: First “chapter book” you can remember reading as a child Er - huh? Meaning not a picture book? I think it would be one of the many William books. Day 16: Longest book you’ve read The Quincunx. Day 17: Shortest book you’ve read What a silly question - the shortest book I currently have is Giving Up by Jillian Becker which is about the last week in the life of Sylvia Plath - 48 pages. Big print too. Day 18: Book you’re most embarrassed to say you like True crime , all the way! Hell Ranch! Day 19: Book that turned you on Sigh - do I have to answer this? - no? Okay, next - Day 20: Book you’ve read the most number of times The Circus of Dr Lao by Charles Finney Day 21: Favorite picture book from childhood None, I was very deprived Day 22: Book you plan to read next The Time of our Singing, maybe. Day 23: Book you tell people you’ve read, but haven’t (or haven’t actually finished) As if! What do you take me for! Day 24: Book that contains your favorite scene This is a stupid question - favourite scene? Well, I did think the involuntary Bobbitting of the boyfriend scene in The World According to Garp was extremely memorable. Day 25: Favorite book you read in school Can't remember. Day 26: Favorite nonfiction book The Earth from the Air. Day 27: Favorite fiction book Too many to mention. Day 28: Last book you read Topping from Below Day 29: Book you’re currently reading All Hell Let Loose Day 30: Favorite coffee table book Victorian Painting, Lionel Lambourne ** Wow, that was kind of boring - I could think of better questions than those. Anyone care to do the PB Goodreads Instant Challenge? What's the author you most recently wanted to kill? What's your favourite book cover? What's the ugliest book cover you've seen recently? What's the most ridiculous place you've ever tried to read? Who's the sexiest author? Why do you despair at the state of the contemporary novel? What would YOU have given the Booker to, since you say all the actual winners are such crap? What's the last thing you found squashed between the pages of a book? What's the last argument you had about a book? What's your weirdest book story?"

        "text":"Here we have Dale Peck doing the fish slapping dance with a few of his literary contemporaries, and I love it. They have to stand there rigid and appearing to be unconcerned while sprightly Dale hops around, derides them horribly, and slaps their chops with a large haddock. I would give this book 5 stars, but mostly, Dale is beating up on authors I haven't read and - now! - have no intention of reading, so it's mostly somebody else's (beautifully invectivised) argument. The authors here dissected, filleted and grossly insulted who I never read are : Sven Birkerts Colson Whitehead Jamaica Kincaid Terry McMillan Jim Crace Stanley Crouch Rick Moody and the ones I have read are DFW Kurt Vonnegut Julian Barnes Sapphire Philip Roth So I guess this is the hipster version of B R Myers' A Reader's Manifesto which denounced certain American literary authors for their pretensions and general wanky unreadability. Here's Dale speaking generally : even taking into consideration the theory that cinematic and virtual media have displaced the printed word as the dominant narrative form and that the novel and its grown-too-big-for-its-britches sibling, the memoir, are only occasionally profitable anachronisms; even recognising that literary standards and technological advances have made it theoretically feasible for just about anyone to write and publish a book [Dale was writing in 2004] - even considering all these factors, the number of Stepford novels that are written, published, reviewed, and read every year is completely out of control. .... Blame the writing programs and the prize committees, blame the deconstructionist literary critics or the back-patting Siamese-twinned professions of writing and reviewing fiction, blame any or all of the identity communities who read and write those ethnic-or-gender-marketed booster books or blame the dead white European males who forced us to resort to Literature as our Daily Affirmation in the first place. And here's a flavour of his specific charges - first, against Stanley Crouch : Crouch is neither virtuosic nor possessed of good marksmanship; he's just another demagogue in an age that confuses demagoguery with honesty; a black man who uses the veil of anti-pc polemic to make criticisms of black culture that white Americans are either too cowed or too smart to put forth themselves... suffice it to say that here is one black man calling other black men monkeys, denying blackness to those African Americans who fail to live up to his standards and conferring it on those who do. ... Don't the Moon Look Lonesome is a terrible novel, badly conceived, badly executed, and put forward in bad faith... and now David Foster Wallace : What makes Infinite Jest's success even more noteworthy is that it is, in a word, terrible. Other words I might use include bloated, boring, gratuitous and - perhaps especially - uncontrolled. I would, in fact, go so far as to say that infinite Jest is one of the very few novels for which the phrase \"not worth the paper it's printed on\" has real meaning at least in an ecological sense; but to resort to such hyperbole would be to fall into the rut that characterizes many reviews of this novel... I resent the five weeks of my life I gave over to reading the thing; I resent every endlessly over-elaborated gag in the book, like a ten-page riff on why video telephones are unviable, or the dozen pages on the teenager who won all his tennis matches by playing with a pistol held to his head, or the thousands and thousands and thousands of words devoted to pharmaceutical trivia on all sorts of mind-altering drugs.... I could, a la Edward Said, accuseWallace of cultural colonialism in the peppering of his otherwise exclusively white male text with exoticized African-Americans, women, and homosexuals, and, further, I think the case can be made that the narrative technique Wallace has derived from Pynchon is nothing more than a watered-down de(homo)-eroticized style that lives on Sontag's \"barren edge of Camp\". You may not agree with Dale, but I still recommed his book, because for some of us bookish types, it's the nearest thing to a bracing walk in a drench of freezing rain on a cliff path with crumbly edges and no guard rail."

        "text":"At a New York literary event in 2005, Richard Ford, the American fiction aristocrat, stepped up to Colson Whitehead and spat on him. Whitehead, the author of two novels and an emerging African-American voice of some importance, had reviewed Ford's A Multitude of Sins in the New York Times, attributing to it failings in the nature of self-absorption, incompleteness and 'whining.' The incident, as reported in New York Magazine, was just part of a debate over book reviewing that's raging among the literati. Its value as a cultural performance is being questioned, as is its purported pirating by the so-called 'snark' school of reviewers. Two years ago the novelist Heidi Julavits confessed in an interview that while reading reviews of her first book ‘… the tiniest little criticisms in it, and I would be completely under the table for three days.’ She thus set off on a crusade to make literary comment more sensitive, helping launch a new magazine, The Believer; so named, she infers, in the spirit of vanquishing the ‘unbelievers’. Writing in the debut issue Julavits minted the ‘snark’ label for that cadre of nattering nabobs of literary negativism and proclaimed a yearning for a literary culture that supports ‘ambition’. A number of darlings of the publishing world—Dave Eggars, Jonathan Franzen, and Zadie Smith among them—caught up in the notion of this odd immunity-from-literary-prosecution cult, have jumped aboard the seemingly irony-free anti-snark freedom train. Though physical conflict in literary circles is no new thing—Norman Mailer and Gore Vidal haven’t sat close at a dinner party since the nineteen-sixties—the current strain of book-notice venom is felt by many to be more pernicious than ever. Even the snarkers are at each other: Dale Peck, in his splendid new book Hatchet Jobs: Writings on Contemporary Fiction, says of Whitehead’s novel John Henry Days: ‘…(the author’s) ambitions are so vast they seemed to have snowed readers into confusing intended with actual product.’ So far there is no word on Whitehead’s intentions for expectorate vengeance upon Dale Peck. Is all this just a tempest in a Starbuck’s? Should fragile people be writers or vice versa? Should a negative review be a spittle-firing squad offence? Hard to say, sensitivity being universally understood as essential to artistry. But oblivious to whatever damage might come to the egos of his targets or to his own reputation, over the past eight years or so Dale Peck has been leading the charge for what seems to me, having read a number of the authors under his mention, some kind of truth in reviewing. Though on record as being interested only in advancing the art of fiction, Peck here stands as a voice for the reading audience out there who expect a positively-reviewed book of literary fiction to at least be readable, if not entertaining in some way. Hatchet Jobs configures seventeen of Peck’s most erudite reviews into a persuasive anti-pretension polemic. On the firing line are writers such as Rick Moody (…the worst writer of his generation); David Foster Wallace (…proof that the Great American Hype Machine can still work wonders); Jim Crace (…everything I despise about contemporary fiction.); and Julian Barnes (…crawls under your skin and itches like rabies). Snark reviews might simply seem nasty to the average not-looking-for-trouble-reader out there, but Peck notes a distinct damping down of excitement in fiction over the past few years. Among other complaints, he notes an over-dependence upon family history to stand in for and sometimes interfere with actual storytelling (see comments re autobiography below), and the artless application of personal philosophy, sans conceit, thick onto the page. Peck cites Stanley Crouch’s Don’t The Moon Look Lonesome, and The Autobiography of My Mother, by Jamaica Kincaid, as particularly so afflicted. But by the tenor of the mainstream reviews, Peck points out, these pat books might be works of genius. Thus it is not just authors he is after, but critics, who are—as in the past and even more in this age of vocational multitasking—often one and the same. He snorts: ‘…as over-rated and misguided as most of our celebrated novelists are, it seems to me that the fault isn’t entirely theirs, but must be vested to some degree in those who praise them for their efforts.’ Peck strives thus to deflate the puffery of the pretentious, the exclusion-ism of a literary-intellectual cult whose recent efforts have tended to partition general readership from the exalted personages of discernment (i.e. themselves). He sneers at the …pseudo-intellectual artists and critics who think their love of books translates into some kind of knowledge….Chances are they will alienate more and more readers from all fiction. In castigating the novelist\/critic Sven Birkets, whose critical screeds Peck believes aspire vastly beyond the author’s capabilities, he lashes: …with friends like this, literature needs an enema. When fiction is not the subject, Peck takes on those ‘veterans’ of one or two books, mainly writing program grads younger than fifty, with the temerity to be penning exhaustive, finely-facted autobiographies. Peck dismisses Birkets’ My Sky Blue Trades, thusly: …dull from just about anyone, but coming from someone who seems to have done a little bit less than the average man of his day…it was particularly boring. Hatchet Jobs is written with a thoroughgoing aplomb and in a spirit of entertainment no doubt vastly more engaging than the works being discussed. As a novelist himself, Peck is obviously self-interested in promoting the purchase, reading and enjoyment of fiction. And amid the jabs, cuts and slams, it is clear by his extensive research that he fully expects to be examined himself. For every dull book he is paid to read, Peck force-marches himself through the author’s oeuvre, slapping himself alert over many hundreds of doze-inducing pages, just in case there might have been something worthwhile earlier on. He then discusses the work in near excessive detail; these reviews are journal pieces, usually published in places where books are the general subject. They run to quite un-newspaperly lengths, usually three thousands words, some far longer. Though the book is full of biting reductions, Hatchet Jobs is not all nastiness. Almost touching is Peck’s consideration of the fallen career of Kurt Vonnegut; the cult-meister’s albatross-like curse of trying to follow himself; the emptiness of his later fiction. This is a book written so well that it can be enjoyed even if you haven’t read any of the works addressed. If Dale Peck can be critically checked at all in this effort it would be in the choosing of his targets. By the sampling offered in Hatchet Jobs, it is clear he has given the up-and-comers most of his ink; eschewing, or perhaps simply not being assigned, terrific American writers like style-maker Cormac McCarthy, genre-breaker James Elroy, urban-cool master Don DeLillo, or first novelist Charles Frazier, whose Cold Mountain would have blown off Peck’s drowsiness in just a few sentences."

Several of the targets of Peck's criticism (I'm looking at you Sven Birkerts and Stanley Crouch) are overdue for a take-down and, uncharitable blowhards themselves, they'll get no crocodile tears from me. But the net result of reading these relentlessly nasty reviews in a collection was a dislike of Dale Peck that grew with each essay. I guess it's like comic relief in a thriller - the funny parts make the scary parts scarier. Similarly, a little generosity in a critic makes harsh critical judgments seem a little more righteous. The unmixed bile on offer here is a disagreeable read. Peck's self-pitying complaints to the contrary, no one is trying to 'silence' him by labeling him a bitch. His bitchy tone assaults anyone with a metaphorical ear. Straw silencers, be damned! Peck can defend the still-beating heart of literature (his actual image, I kid you not*) with all the catty poison at his command. He may be the very soul of literary rectitude, but I don't like his company and I won't be spending any more time with him. There's entirely too much else to read out there. *For someone with such sniffy, Brahminical sensibilities, Peck's own writing is replete with howlers like this in addition to appalling freshman comp mistakes such as subject\/verb disagreement.

(The one recent book he discusses that I've read, Sven Birkerts' GUTENBERG ELEGIES, I liked more than he did but I have no problem taking his word for how awful most of the others are.) In my view, Peck runs into trouble when he attempts a deeper analysis of what went wrong with fiction, making James Joyce his pet villain. Seems Joyce (so says Peck) showed real promise when he wrote \"The Dead\" but then darn it, he got self-indulgent and blew it with A PORTRAIT and ULYSSES. Peck ignores, or misses, some key points here, such as (A) Joyce wrote only four works of fiction, so rather than having a lot of works to deal with, his readers have a few works to deal with, albeit works that must be dealt with intensely if one is to understand them at all. (B) With Joyce, it's \"in for a penny, in for a pound.\" If you don't want to spend a lot of time on critical thinking you should read other writers. (C) No one had to be influenced by Joyce who didn't want to be. And of course, (D)It's not Joyce's fault if later writers weren't, or aren't as good as he was. Peck is a born hatchet man and that's fine, as long as he doesn't try to be a constructive critic."

Unfortunately these essays are mostly bitter, mean, and stupid, which is a shame, because many of them contain well-reasoned investigations of various authors. The best essay was, to me, a sort of elegy for Kurt Vonnegut (which is strange, because he wasn't dead when this was published). I completely agreed with most of Dale Peck's assessment of Vonnegut, whose characters grapple with the futility of free will in the face of a chaotic and indifferent universe. Peck makes the point that Vonnegut's early novels contain \"tragic heroes\" who refuse to accept the absurdity of their existences, whereas in his later novels his main (often autobiographical) characters mostly surrender to either absurdity or death. Which effectively renders them (and him) impotent. Also, Sapphire got a half a million advance for Push ? Seriously?"

        "text":"This is a companion piece to A Reader's Manifesto: An Attack on the Growing Pretentiousness in American Literary Prose , taking swipe at modern writers and arguing that inn many cases their exalted status is undeserved. It is longer than Myers and tends to group writers as representative of a feted group rather than deal with them individually. As such there is little overlap although if you are Don DeLillo or Rick Moody you must be questioning your life choices right now. Peck’s approach is more chatty, more humorous and while it can seem less scholarly, less intellectually rigorous and easier to read the insight and understanding of literature is no less than Myers and it is Peck’s skill to furnish his mental acuity with accessibility. It is worth reading even if you have very little interest in literature for the cutting comments he peppers the book with, the type you wish you yourself had the wit to make. His take-down of Birkerts My Sky Blue Trades: Growing Up Counter in a Contrary Time is stored in my memory just waiting to be used in the right situation, “Birkets …isn’t re-viewing his life in MSBT, he’s reviewing it in much the same way he reviews fiction, telling his readers what thy can learn from the text of his life. This sort of pedagogy would be dull from just about anyone, but coming form someone who seems to have done a little bit less than the average man of his day…it was particularly boring.” Like Myers he addresses some of the issues that plagued me working in a bookshop – one being if you have a separate gay fiction section you’re effectively cutting out a large swathe of the buying market. It’s not even a deliberate decision, I’ve never read Alan Hollinghurst largely because he has been put on the Gay section shelf and that is not somewhere I’d look. He takes issue with authors who try to deal with societal issues yet only populate their novels with gay characters. Gay fiction and literature that has gay protagonists are different beasts and yet there is a clamour to see them as the same. I could not help but think of my most hated book, A Little Life when he talks of the current trend for gay epics where the epicdom derives “Not from depth of thought but depth-of-book, measured not in pages but inches.” His critique of Like People in History articulates exactly why I hated Yanagihara’s work so much. Both books start with a depressing premise – child abuse or AIDS and shows a main character who suffers but is also so insufferable to everyone around them and both authors duck explaining why anyone is attracted to these emotional black holes. Both run through a series of gimmicks where the events become increasingly horrific and decreasingly believable. Again Peck casts a final killer blow when having revealed the final boss of gimmicks – that a main character, who just happens to be a repeat winner of Mr Gay America, is the offspring of two parents with Down syndrome, ” The threesome [the parents and the son’s lover] have an extended conversation on homosexuality, AIDS and the myth of Achilles and Patroclus, all conducted in a five-year-old’s English , which seems to be a sort of lowest-common-denominator approach to both narrative and morality. In a book already groaning with gimmicks…it backfires because the words and ideas Matt’s retarded parents use are no less sophisticated than those used anywhere else [in the book].” Ouch! Peck then moves on to the power of marketing to package bad books through grouping them as a literary movement. He takes to task three contemporary black women writers who all have ridden the tails of the movement and lack anything fresh or worthwhile. His discussion of Precious by Sapphire highlights how it is in many ways the same skeleton as the gay epics just with a different skin. Again the list of tribulations heaped upon Precious seems more like a shopping list and so loses impact. ”Precious is kicked out of school for her behaviour problems and because she can’t read (it’s not her fault, she’s got troubles, and besides, she’s dyslexic too); then finally she learns she’s HIV positive. Still these tragedies are somehow contextualised…by the fact that Precious is taught to read by a lesbian named Blue Rain. All told, Sapphire has written a slim piece of propaganda designed to deliver the novel message that father-daughter rape is a bad thing and literacy a good thing.” Sapphire also falls into the trap of not knowing how to give voice to her character. She has her speaking in an uneducated , grammatically incorrect slang, yet we know she has educated herself. If she is writing it before education that’s false as she was illiterate and if she is writing it from a future place where she has educated herself why is she using the language of her past giving the book a false naivete. This is the heart of Peck’s argument, that laziness has been rewarded not through talent but purely by fitting the current requirements in the identity politics market. In case you think this book just serves to give a kicking to marginalised groups, Peck directs his steel toe-caps to the lauded old, white men of literature. He has no time for Julian Barnes describing a lot of his work as, “harmless drivel, but it doesn’t explain why Barnes’ writing crawls under your skin and itches like scabies.” and when he quotes sections like the following you have to concede the point even if it is harshly made, ”We are all, are we not, lost. Those who know it not are the more lost. Those who do know it are found, for they have grasped their full lostness.” His issue with Jim Crace is very much like Myers problem with much of modern literature, that in lieu of anything profound to say on the big subjects the smallness of life, the insignificant is imbued with a depth that is undeserving and inappropriate. My point is not that Crace’s new book is bad, but rather that in its exclusively banal view of life, death, sex and art in its solemn pseudominimalist belief that any trivial detail, earnestly presented, is filled with significance, and in its reference-librarian’s elevation of facts to totems, it is so bad that I began to suspect that he might actually have talent.” Peck continues the mauling of Rick Moody where Myers left off. “ …If I follow his reasoning, which can be difficult since it proceeds primarily by rhythm and evocation rather than logic, then this book is meant to tell us what that sin is. By the time I finished reading, I was convinced the book was the sin. …To be an American, Moody writes in one of the few syntactically lucid sentences in the book (unfortunately its also the third to last)… The conclusion arrived at is the same as Myers. That contemporary literary fiction is weak because, “ they write for one another rather than some more or less common reader. Their prose shares a showiness that speaks of solidarity and competition…falsely intellectual.” Where did it all go wrong you may ask. Peck blames Joyce, citing Portrait of the Artist as the chapter by chapter unravelling of a talent and Ulysses as, “nothing more than a hoax upon literature, a joint shenanigan of the author and the critical establishment…” Having read neither I cannot offer an opinion other than to say I have never been interested in reading either because I think deep in my literary instinct I have long suspected it to be the case. Peck is a brilliant critic, a deep understanding of literature and the ability to critique it in a persuasive and entertaining way. If you’ve been toying with whether to kill your literary darlings, save your energy, Peck has already got to them with his keen-edged axe."

Here goes Day 1: Favorite book Bad start - there's no such animal. But let's say Ulysses. Day 2: Least favorite book Oh, I know this one - American Psycho. But Topping from Below runs it close second. Day 3: Book that makes you laugh out loud The Innocent Anthropologist by Nigel Barley will do. Also Trainspotting, Irvine Welsh. Day 4: Book that makes you cry Such a Long Journey, Rohinton Mistry Day 5: Book you wish you could live in The Fermata by Nicholson Baker but only if I could be the despicable Arno Strine. Day 6: Favorite young adult book Titus Groan Day 7: Book that you can quote\/recite Both Incredible String Band songbooks and a bit of Beautiful Losers (Leonard Cohen). Also bits of the Bible. Day 8: Book that scares you American Psycho - it scares me that reasonably intelligent people can think that it's satire and that makes it okay Day 9: Book that makes you sick So many, so many, but let's go for The Protocols of the Elders of Zion, a bit obvious I know. The Mad Man by Samuel Delaney was fairly trying too. Topping from below, of course - the dog scene was a classic. Day 10: Book that changed your life Something Wicked this way Comes by Ray Bradbury. Day 11: Book from your favorite author I suppose Rohinton Mistry is my current favourite author, so A Fine Balance. Day 12: Book that is most like your life In terms of job, and not having read it but read about it, Microserfs by Douglas Coupland. Day 13: Book whose main character is most like you The Bible Part Two (aka New testament) - Doubting Thomas Day 14: Book whose main character you want to marry The Crimson Petal and the White - Sugar - she's so nice - except she turns into a same sex oriented person eventually. So that would be like Ross in Friends. So perhaps not. Okay - I know - Kate from The Country Girls (Edna O'Brien) - she's hilarious and in my mind she's a knockout too. Day 15: First “chapter book” you can remember reading as a child Er - huh? Meaning not a picture book? I think it would be one of the many William books. Day 16: Longest book you’ve read The Quincunx. Day 17: Shortest book you’ve read What a silly question - the shortest book I currently have is Giving Up by Jillian Becker which is about the last week in the life of Sylvia Plath - 48 pages. Big print too. Day 18: Book you’re most embarrassed to say you like True crime , all the way! Hell Ranch! Day 19: Book that turned you on Sigh - do I have to answer this? - no? Okay, next - Day 20: Book you’ve read the most number of times The Circus of Dr Lao by Charles Finney Day 21: Favorite picture book from childhood None, I was very deprived Day 22: Book you plan to read next The Time of our Singing, maybe. Day 23: Book you tell people you’ve read, but haven’t (or haven’t actually finished) As if! What do you take me for! Day 24: Book that contains your favorite scene This is a stupid question - favourite scene? Well, I did think the involuntary Bobbitting of the boyfriend scene in The World According to Garp was extremely memorable. Day 25: Favorite book you read in school Can't remember. Day 26: Favorite nonfiction book The Earth from the Air. Day 27: Favorite fiction book Too many to mention. Day 28: Last book you read Topping from Below Day 29: Book you’re currently reading All Hell Let Loose Day 30: Favorite coffee table book Victorian Painting, Lionel Lambourne ** Wow, that was kind of boring - I could think of better questions than those. Anyone care to do the PB Goodreads Instant Challenge? What's the author you most recently wanted to kill? What's your favourite book cover? What's the ugliest book cover you've seen recently? What's the most ridiculous place you've ever tried to read? Who's the sexiest author? Why do you despair at the state of the contemporary novel? What would YOU have given the Booker to, since you say all the actual winners are such crap? What's the last thing you found squashed between the pages of a book?

        "text":"Here we have Dale Peck doing the fish slapping dance with a few of his literary contemporaries, and I love it. They have to stand there rigid and appearing to be unconcerned while sprightly Dale hops around, derides them horribly, and slaps their chops with a large haddock. I would give this book 5 stars, but mostly, Dale is beating up on authors I haven't read and - now! - have no intention of reading, so it's mostly somebody else's (beautifully invectivised) argument. The authors here dissected, filleted and grossly insulted who I never read are : Sven Birkerts Colson Whitehead Jamaica Kincaid Terry McMillan Jim Crace Stanley Crouch Rick Moody and the ones I have read are DFW Kurt Vonnegut Julian Barnes Sapphire Philip Roth So I guess this is the hipster version of B R Myers' A Reader's Manifesto which denounced certain American literary authors for their pretensions and general wanky unreadability. Here's Dale speaking generally : even taking into consideration the theory that cinematic and virtual media have displaced the printed word as the dominant narrative form and that the novel and its grown-too-big-for-its-britches sibling, the memoir, are only occasionally profitable anachronisms; even recognising that literary standards and technological advances have made it theoretically feasible for just about anyone to write and publish a book [Dale was writing in 2004] - even considering all these factors, the number of Stepford novels that are written, published, reviewed, and read every year is completely out of control. .... Blame the writing programs and the prize committees, blame the deconstructionist literary critics or the back-patting Siamese-twinned professions of writing and reviewing fiction, blame any or all of the identity communities who read and write those ethnic-or-gender-marketed booster books or blame the dead white European males who forced us to resort to Literature as our Daily Affirmation in the first place. And here's a flavour of his specific charges - first, against Stanley Crouch : Crouch is neither virtuosic nor possessed of good marksmanship; he's just another demagogue in an age that confuses demagoguery with honesty; a black man who uses the veil of anti-pc polemic to make criticisms of black culture that white Americans are either too cowed or too smart to put forth themselves... suffice it to say that here is one black man calling other black men monkeys, denying blackness to those African Americans who fail to live up to his standards and conferring it on those who do. ... Don't the Moon Look Lonesome is a terrible novel, badly conceived, badly executed, and put forward in bad faith... and now David Foster Wallace : What makes Infinite Jest's success even more noteworthy is that it is, in a word, terrible. Other words I might use include bloated, boring, gratuitous and - perhaps especially - uncontrolled. I would, in fact, go so far as to say that infinite Jest is one of the very few novels for which the phrase \"not worth the paper it's printed on\" has real meaning at least in an ecological sense; but to resort to such hyperbole would be to fall into the rut that characterizes many reviews of this novel... I resent the five weeks of my life I gave over to reading the thing; I resent every endlessly over-elaborated gag in the book, like a ten-page riff on why video telephones are unviable, or the dozen pages on the teenager who won all his tennis matches by playing with a pistol held to his head, or the thousands and thousands and thousands of words devoted to pharmaceutical trivia on all sorts of mind-altering drugs.... I could, a la Edward Said, accuseWallace of cultural colonialism in the peppering of his otherwise exclusively white male text with exoticized African-Americans, women, and homosexuals, and, further, I think the case can be made that the narrative technique Wallace has derived from Pynchon is nothing more than a watered-down de(homo)-eroticized style that lives on Sontag's \"barren edge of Camp\". You may not agree with Dale, but I still recommed his book, because for some of us bookish types, it's the nearest thing to a bracing walk in a drench of freezing rain on a cliff path with crumbly edges and no guard rail."

        "text":"At a New York literary event in 2005, Richard Ford, the American fiction aristocrat, stepped up to Colson Whitehead and spat on him. Whitehead, the author of two novels and an emerging African-American voice of some importance, had reviewed Ford's A Multitude of Sins in the New York Times, attributing to it failings in the nature of self-absorption, incompleteness and 'whining.' The incident, as reported in New York Magazine, was just part of a debate over book reviewing that's raging among the literati. Its value as a cultural performance is being questioned, as is its purported pirating by the so-called 'snark' school of reviewers. Two years ago the novelist Heidi Julavits confessed in an interview that while reading reviews of her first book ‘… the tiniest little criticisms in it, and I would be completely under the table for three days.’ She thus set off on a crusade to make literary comment more sensitive, helping launch a new magazine, The Believer; so named, she infers, in the spirit of vanquishing the ‘unbelievers’. Writing in the debut issue Julavits minted the ‘snark’ label for that cadre of nattering nabobs of literary negativism and proclaimed a yearning for a literary culture that supports ‘ambition’. A number of darlings of the publishing world—Dave Eggars, Jonathan Franzen, and Zadie Smith among them—caught up in the notion of this odd immunity-from-literary-prosecution cult, have jumped aboard the seemingly irony-free anti-snark freedom train. Though physical conflict in literary circles is no new thing—Norman Mailer and Gore Vidal haven’t sat close at a dinner party since the nineteen-sixties—the current strain of book-notice venom is felt by many to be more pernicious than ever. Even the snarkers are at each other: Dale Peck, in his splendid new book Hatchet Jobs: Writings on Contemporary Fiction, says of Whitehead’s novel John Henry Days: ‘…(the author’s) ambitions are so vast they seemed to have snowed readers into confusing intended with actual product.’ So far there is no word on Whitehead’s intentions for expectorate vengeance upon Dale Peck. Is all this just a tempest in a Starbuck’s? Should fragile people be writers or vice versa? Should a negative review be a spittle-firing squad offence? Hard to say, sensitivity being universally understood as essential to artistry. But oblivious to whatever damage might come to the egos of his targets or to his own reputation, over the past eight years or so Dale Peck has been leading the charge for what seems to me, having read a number of the authors under his mention, some kind of truth in reviewing. Though on record as being interested only in advancing the art of fiction, Peck here stands as a voice for the reading audience out there who expect a positively-reviewed book of literary fiction to at least be readable, if not entertaining in some way. Hatchet Jobs configures seventeen of Peck’s most erudite reviews into a persuasive anti-pretension polemic. On the firing line are writers such as Rick Moody (…the worst writer of his generation); David Foster Wallace (…proof that the Great American Hype Machine can still work wonders); Jim Crace (…everything I despise about contemporary fiction.); and Julian Barnes (…crawls under your skin and itches like rabies). Snark reviews might simply seem nasty to the average not-looking-for-trouble-reader out there, but Peck notes a distinct damping down of excitement in fiction over the past few years. Among other complaints, he notes an over-dependence upon family history to stand in for and sometimes interfere with actual storytelling (see comments re autobiography below), and the artless application of personal philosophy, sans conceit, thick onto the page. Peck cites Stanley Crouch’s Don’t The Moon Look Lonesome, and The Autobiography of My Mother, by Jamaica Kincaid, as particularly so afflicted. But by the tenor of the mainstream reviews, Peck points out, these pat books might be works of genius. Thus it is not just authors he is after, but critics, who are—as in the past and even more in this age of vocational multitasking—often one and the same. He snorts: ‘…as over-rated and misguided as most of our celebrated novelists are, it seems to me that the fault isn’t entirely theirs, but must be vested to some degree in those who praise them for their efforts.’ Peck strives thus to deflate the puffery of the pretentious, the exclusion-ism of a literary-intellectual cult whose recent efforts have tended to partition general readership from the exalted personages of discernment (i.e. themselves). He sneers at the …pseudo-intellectual artists and critics who think their love of books translates into some kind of knowledge….Chances are they will alienate more and more readers from all fiction. In castigating the novelist\/critic Sven Birkets, whose critical screeds Peck believes aspire vastly beyond the author’s capabilities, he lashes: …with friends like this, literature needs an enema. When fiction is not the subject, Peck takes on those ‘veterans’ of one or two books, mainly writing program grads younger than fifty, with the temerity to be penning exhaustive, finely-facted autobiographies. Peck dismisses Birkets’ My Sky Blue Trades, thusly: …dull from just about anyone, but coming from someone who seems to have done a little bit less than the average man of his day…it was particularly boring. Hatchet Jobs is written with a thoroughgoing aplomb and in a spirit of entertainment no doubt vastly more engaging than the works being discussed. As a novelist himself, Peck is obviously self-interested in promoting the purchase, reading and enjoyment of fiction. And amid the jabs, cuts and slams, it is clear by his extensive research that he fully expects to be examined himself. For every dull book he is paid to read, Peck force-marches himself through the author’s oeuvre, slapping himself alert over many hundreds of doze-inducing pages, just in case there might have been something worthwhile earlier on. He then discusses the work in near excessive detail; these reviews are journal pieces, usually published in places where books are the general subject. They run to quite un-newspaperly lengths, usually three thousands words, some far longer. Though the book is full of biting reductions, Hatchet Jobs is not all nastiness. Almost touching is Peck’s consideration of the fallen career of Kurt Vonnegut; the cult-meister’s albatross-like curse of trying to follow himself; the emptiness of his later fiction. This is a book written so well that it can be enjoyed even if you haven’t read any of the works addressed. If Dale Peck can be critically checked at all in this effort it would be in the choosing of his targets. By the sampling offered in Hatchet Jobs, it is clear he has given the up-and-comers most of his ink; eschewing, or perhaps simply not being assigned, terrific American writers like style-maker Cormac McCarthy, genre-breaker James Elroy, urban-cool master Don DeLillo, or first novelist Charles Frazier, whose Cold Mountain would have blown off Peck’s drowsiness in just a few sentences."

Several of the targets of Peck's criticism (I'm looking at you Sven Birkerts and Stanley Crouch) are overdue for a take-down and, uncharitable blowhards themselves, they'll get no crocodile tears from me. But the net result of reading these relentlessly nasty reviews in a collection was a dislike of Dale Peck that grew with each essay. I guess it's like comic relief in a thriller - the funny parts make the scary parts scarier. Similarly, a little generosity in a critic makes harsh critical judgments seem a little more righteous. The unmixed bile on offer here is a disagreeable read. Peck's self-pitying complaints to the contrary, no one is trying to 'silence' him by labeling him a bitch. His bitchy tone assaults anyone with a metaphorical ear. Straw silencers, be damned! Peck can defend the still-beating heart of literature (his actual image, I kid you not*) with all the catty poison at his command. He may be the very soul of literary rectitude, but I don't like his company and I won't be spending any more time with him.

        "text":"I recently purchased the following books: 'The Peron Novel' by Tomas Eloy Martinez, 'I Served the King of England' by Bohumil Hrabal, 'The Language We use Up Here' by Philip Gambone, 'The Diary of an Innocent' by Tony Duvert, 'Whose Song' by Thomas Glave, 'Ourselves' by Jonathan Strong and Yves Navarre 'The Little Rogue in Our Flesh' - about the same time I read an article with a list of 'The Giants of Contemporary Literary Fiction' who were Saul Bellows, Norman Mailer, Philip Roth, John Updike, Sven Birkerts, Colson Whitehead, Jamaica Kincaid, Terry McMillan, Jim Crace, Stanley Crouch, Rick Moody and David Foster Wallace. None of the authors I have chosen to read are on the 'giants' list - at least four of my novels were not originally written in English (I am reading them in translation) so my comparison may be flawed - but even if I replaced those novels with ones written in English I know my list would still not contain any of the 'giants'. Indeed I am sure that amongst the 3,000 odd 'want to read' books I have listed on GoodReads none of the 'giants' appear. I mention all this because I approached this book with some wariness because of my ignorance of so much of the 'contemporary literature' that literary critics regard as important. I needn't have worried - previously I had only Know Mr. Peck as a marvelous novelist; now I respect and admire him for demolishing so many sacred cows and laying bare the dead end road that so much contemporary literature is on. Absolutely well worth reading - I adored what he had to say about Felice Picano's 'Like People in History' and Ethan Morden's 'How Long has this Been Going On' (just in case you imagined it was only SWM (straight white men) that he was knocking off their pedestals) and I wish I could demolition overblown mediocre writing with such style and perception."

        "text":"Some readers have complained that this aptly titled work isn't as meaningful or useful as B. R. Myers' A READER'S MANIFESTO and I agree, but I still enjoy Peck's eviscerations of what passes for contemporary American literature. (The one recent book he discusses that I've read, Sven Birkerts' GUTENBERG ELEGIES, I liked more than he did but I have no problem taking his word for how awful most of the others are.) In my view, Peck runs into trouble when he attempts a deeper analysis of what went wrong with fiction, making James Joyce his pet villain. Seems Joyce (so says Peck) showed real promise when he wrote \"The Dead\" but then darn it, he got self-indulgent and blew it with A PORTRAIT and ULYSSES. Peck ignores, or misses, some key points here, such as (A) Joyce wrote only four works of fiction, so rather than having a lot of works to deal with, his readers have a few works to deal with, albeit works that must be dealt with intensely if one is to understand them at all. (B) With Joyce, it's \"in for a penny, in for a pound.\" If you don't want to spend a lot of time on critical thinking you should read other writers. (C) No one had to be influenced by Joyce who didn't want to be. And of course, (D)It's not Joyce's fault if later writers weren't, or aren't as good as he was. Peck is a born hatchet man and that's fine, as long as he doesn't try to be a constructive critic."

        "text":"I read this book because I dislike most contemporary literary fiction. So does this author. So I was hoping that I would learn more about why I hate most novels published within the last few years. Unfortunately these essays are mostly bitter, mean, and stupid, which is a shame, because many of them contain well-reasoned investigations of various authors. The best essay was, to me, a sort of elegy for Kurt Vonnegut (which is strange, because he wasn't dead when this was published). I completely agreed with most of Dale Peck's assessment of Vonnegut, whose characters grapple with the futility of free will in the face of a chaotic and indifferent universe. Peck makes the point that Vonnegut's early novels contain \"tragic heroes\" who refuse to accept the absurdity of their existences, whereas in his later novels his main (often autobiographical) characters mostly surrender to either absurdity or death. Which effectively renders them (and him) impotent. Also, Sapphire got a half a million advance for Push ? Seriously?"

        "text":"Don't read this and then try to write anything, ever. The first piece is hilarious, a long-deserved crucifixion of the unconscionably boring Sven Birkerts; but then I stopped laughing when I hit the subsequent reviews, in which he CARVES INTO Wallace, Franzen, Moody, DeLillo, et al. Oh, and Joyce. And Faulkner. Also, for someone who's so high and mighty about English syntax, he can at times write confusingly. There are oddly murky places in the prose, in sharp contrast to the sizzling lacerating wit which flares up like moths hitting a live wire. I wish I could corner him at a party and pepper him with all kinds of rude questions. But somehow I don't think Dale gets invited to many parties anymore. Unless as an entrée."

His picking apart of the opening of the Jim Crace novel is done much like an English teacher would, to show that the writing just doesn't make much sense. His high opinion of Vonnegut is a bit odd to me, and I think he misses the point of the narration of American Pastoral, but what he says about Jamaica Kincaid, Terry McMillan and Sapphire seem right on to me. A fairly entertaining read that cuts through a lot of linguistic garbage and speaks directly. He doesn't think much of Ulysses, either, or much of Faulkner. I might look into Rebecca Brown to see if his praise there is worth anything."

For people who pay attention, Peck made a huge name for himself a few years ago when he starting swinging like crazy at writers he thought were wasting their talent, including his infamous line about Rick Moody being \"the worst writer of his generation.\" I like him because, like James Wood, he actually cares about what's going on with books, not just getting a paycheck for writing his essay. This is one of those collections that add up to a mission statement about art instead of a grab bag of one-offs."

        "text":"With ten stories from various authors and genres I'm betting you'll find at least something you like in A Changeling For All Seasons, and may even discover a few things you didn’t realize you enjoyed until now. I know I did. Angela Knight - A Vampire Christmas Picture walking into your home feeling on top of the world knowing your sexy fiancé is waiting with open arms. Only you open the door and instead of the loving man you expected you get a bloodthirsty creature. This is exactly what happens to Amelia. She had no idea what happened, she only knew was that life would never be normal again. I really did enjoy this story because you frequently read about falling in love with a supernatural, but it is rare to read about a character having someone they love changing and having to choose whether to leave them or accept them. One thing I did wish I got more of was David's POV. It was hard to follow the relationship development because I just didn’t know enough about his character to understand his actions. In the end though everything worked itself out and Amelia may not have ended up with the life she dreamed of, but she got one equally rewarding. Sahara Kelly - A Christmas Pageant Joey and Marty sitting in a tree... but they are doing way more that kissing. I really enjoyed this story. It played nicely off of a schoolboy fantasy, which most readers can appreciate. Marty desperately needed change to get past the rut in his life, and Joey definitely changed things for him. All he has to do is get her out of that skimpy outfit and into his bed. Judy Mays - Jingle Balls With a name like Jingle Balls this story has got to be good! Then I started reading it and thought to myself “Uh oh, this is some cheesy play off of Christmas”. Well I should have gone with my original thought because turns out it was good. By the time they made it to the club scene I was sold. The relationship development while a little slow to start but after a while really drew me in. Richard and Jessica definitely do complement each other well including both of their tempers. It seems both characters can go off at any given moment so I know their relationship will be one interesting ride. And yes I even enjoyed the cheesy play off of Christmas. Marteeka Karland - Sealed With A Kiss We have moved from Christmas to Valentine’s Day. I have to admit I have mix feeling about this story. The relationship develop for me was good, but the overall plot of the story just seemed as if it was missing something. I would have liked just a little more excitement or conflict. I prefer a more complex plot, but the relationship itself was good. I liked that it was almost a competition between Marie and Daxon on who could seduce who first. Plus in this relationship you can see the emotional development without being told about it, which I liked. All-in-all it was a story I enjoyed reading. Kate Douglas - My Valentine Ginny is my favorite character within this anthology so far. She suffered greatly in her life and deserved a shot at happiness. Her happiness is in the form of St. Valentine and, as appropriate to the holiday, he sweeps her off her feet and warms her heart and soul in an attempt to show her what life and living should be. This is a short story I can see myself reading over again and still getting that warm fuzzy feeling in my heart every time. Shelby Morgen – Changeling Now it's time for St. Patrick’s day and where better to celebrate than Ireland! This story was an interesting one since we start with Michael, a none believer in all things magical, but drunk enough to explore anyway. I liked the way the relationship between Arien and Michael unraveled especially the twist of them being together. One thing I was disappointed by was the end of the story. I would have liked to have seen a more definitive conclusion, but regardless, I consider this another lovely story. Willa Okati - Elven Enchantment I absolutely adored this story. Ciara had some crappy luck with men until she walks into a bar. Even though there was a band the real show was the two guys who couldn’t keep their hands off each other -- a far better show, and Ciara thought so, too. Even more fun was when Seanan and Ardal invite Ciara for a night of unimaginable pleasure. Who wouldn't jump at the change to join Blondie and Dark & Delicious? Everything about this story was perfect from beginning to end, and I would love to see more of these lovable characters. Kate Hill - Jolene's Pooka Another great story riveted with myth and lore. Larkin is really the stand out character in this story. Athough he came off a little too arrogant and dominant for me, knowing what he is really helps me understand why he acts that way. Apparently it is just what Jolene needs because she falls into his bed, and refuses to leave once she realized how much fun it was. I don't know if the legend of the pooka is true, but I'm sold and would love for one to show up at in front of my house. I wonder if they travel to the city? Lacey Savage - Chemistry to Burn While the beginning of this story confused me a bit I quickly figured out what was going on. Some men will go to any length to get a girl's attention. Griffin is no exception; he refused to play second fiddle to Angelina’s research so he came up with an infallible plan to fix that problem. But he soon realized he may have made a big mistake. I actually liked Griffin once I got to know him, he isn’t as bad of a guy that Angelina thought he was. Griffin, go get your girl and refuse to accept no for an answer! Shelby Morgen - Troll Under The Bridge This story was short enough the characters were able to be fairly anonymous, only going by Troll and Cop. I think this was a nice little encounter at the end of this anthology. The twist at the end made it interesting. This was the shortest story within the anthology so there really wasn’t room for error and the author made sure there were none. All in all I would have to say this was good anthology. I think that it had a nice theme that it continued from beginning to end and while each story was different they complemented each other. As a paranormal erotica fan I was able to read about fairies, shifters, trolls, vampires and other creatures. I discovered some new authors that I would love to read more stories by, which is always a plus and one of the reasons I have always enjoyed anthologies. So I would say, go ahead and read this anthology -- you might be surprised by the creatures you bump into. Originally posted at http:\/\/whippedcream2.blogspot.com\/201..."

It played nicely off of a schoolboy fantasy, which most readers can appreciate. Marty desperately needed change to get past the rut in his life, and Joey definitely changed things for him. All he has to do is get her out of that skimpy outfit and into his bed. Judy Mays - Jingle Balls With a name like Jingle Balls this story has got to be good! Then I started reading it and thought to myself “Uh oh, this is some cheesy play off of Christmas”. Well I should have gone with my original thought because turns out it was good. By the time they made it to the club scene I was sold. The relationship development while a little slow to start but after a while really drew me in. Richard and Jessica definitely do complement each other well including both of their tempers. It seems both characters can go off at any given moment so I know their relationship will be one interesting ride. And yes I even enjoyed the cheesy play off of Christmas. Marteeka Karland - Sealed With A Kiss We have moved from Christmas to Valentine’s Day. I have to admit I have mix feeling about this story. The relationship develop for me was good, but the overall plot of the story just seemed as if it was missing something. I would have liked just a little more excitement or conflict. I prefer a more complex plot, but the relationship itself was good. I liked that it was almost a competition between Marie and Daxon on who could seduce who first. Plus in this relationship you can see the emotional development without being told about it, which I liked. All-in-all it was a story I enjoyed reading. Kate Douglas - My Valentine Ginny is my favorite character within this anthology so far. She suffered greatly in her life and deserved a shot at happiness. Her happiness is in the form of St. Valentine and, as appropriate to the holiday, he sweeps her off her feet and warms her heart and soul in an attempt to show her what life and living should be. This is a short story I can see myself reading over again and still getting that warm fuzzy feeling in my heart every time. Shelby Morgen – Changeling Now it's time for St. Patrick’s day and where better to celebrate than Ireland! This story was an interesting one since we start with Michael, a none believer in all things magical, but drunk enough to explore anyway. I liked the way the relationship between Arien and Michael unraveled especially the twist of them being together. One thing I was disappointed by was the end of the story. I would have liked to have seen a more definitive conclusion, but regardless, I consider this another lovely story. Willa Okati - Elven Enchantment I absolutely adored this story. Ciara had some crappy luck with men until she walks into a bar. Even though there was a band the real show was the two guys who couldn’t keep their hands off each other -- a far better show, and Ciara thought so, too. Even more fun was when Seanan and Ardal invite Ciara for a night of unimaginable pleasure. Who wouldn't jump at the change to join Blondie and Dark & Delicious? Everything about this story was perfect from beginning to end, and I would love to see more of these lovable characters. Kate Hill - Jolene's Pooka Another great story riveted with myth and lore. Larkin is really the stand out character in this story. Athough he came off a little too arrogant and dominant for me, knowing what he is really helps me understand why he acts that way. Apparently it is just what Jolene needs because she falls into his bed, and refuses to leave once she realized how much fun it was. I don't know if the legend of the pooka is true, but I'm sold and would love for one to show up at in front of my house. I wonder if they travel to the city? Lacey Savage - Chemistry to Burn While the beginning of this story confused me a bit I quickly figured out what was going on. Some men will go to any length to get a girl's attention. Griffin is no exception; he refused to play second fiddle to Angelina’s research so he came up with an infallible plan to fix that problem. But he soon realized he may have made a big mistake. I actually liked Griffin once I got to know him, he isn’t as bad of a guy that Angelina thought he was. Griffin, go get your girl and refuse to accept no for an answer! Shelby Morgen - Troll Under The Bridge This story was short enough the characters were able to be fairly anonymous, only going by Troll and Cop. I think this was a nice little encounter at the end of this anthology. The twist at the end made it interesting. This was the shortest story within the anthology so there really wasn’t room for error and the author made sure there were none. All in all I would have to say this was good anthology. I think that it had a nice theme that it continued from beginning to end and while each story was different they complemented each other. As a paranormal erotica fan I was able to read about fairies, shifters, trolls, vampires and other creatures. I discovered some new authors that I would love to read more stories by, which is always a plus and one of the reasons I have always enjoyed anthologies. So I would say, go ahead and read this anthology -- you might be surprised by the creatures you bump into. Originally posted at http:\/\/whippedcream2.blogspot.com\/201..."

        "text":"This was a really fun read. It is structured in your basic 'magical middle grade quest' arc that fans of Rick Riordan will be familiar with, but Changeling and Neef are both characters and I love how they play off each other. I particularly liked how Changeling exhibited several kind of autistic behaviors [even though it's never discussed explicitly in the text] because a lot of the reasons that people historically would accuse someone of being a changeling would be because they were acting 'weird' and expressing behaviors now associated with autism although they obviously didn't have a name for it back then but I thought that was a nice little touch. I also liked how the author updated a lot of the 'classic' fairy tales to fit into modern New York life, like Jack and the Beanstalk became Jack and the Extension ladder, and having fairies hold domain over things like Broadway and Wall Street instead of more traditional fairy knowes. Definitely going to be checking out the next book!"

Fantastic world-building and a smart, self-aware protagonist -- yay! But that protagonist couldn't manage a believable interaction with any of the other people in the book -- boo! Neef had pretty much no empathy for anyone, no sense that she should be concerned in anything but a mechanical how-does-this-affect-me way with other people's feelings. There could have been a great story in there about what emotions really meant for humans raised by fairies and fairies raised by humans, but the opportunity was lost. The author's short story Catnyp , about the same protagonist when she's a bit older, was much more appealing."

The character development and reference to real world myths are guaranteed to satisfy the writers out there, and the beautiful descriptions of characters, wonderful protagonist flaws, and exciting twists will definitely stop you from putting the book down. Personally, I believe this book is slightly better suited for a writer, since it starts a little slow, really has to be read all at once or you forget about it, and has just the perfect blends of character strengths, flaws, dynamics, and development that I loved. The story follows a changeling girl, Neef (not her real name), who lives in an interesting New York that lives between worlds, filled with all the mythical creatures from all your favorite storybooks. Neef is driven by her need for adventure and her desperation for her own kind, being the only changeling as far as she knows in Central Park, her home. Little does she know how much of both she'll get. Join me on this beautiful blend of modern and traditional fantasy that Changeling embodies in full."

        "text":"First, this book is in the same world as Delia Sherman's \"CATNYP\" from the Datlow\/Windling \"The Faery Reel\" anthology & \"Grand Central Park\" from Datlow\/Windling's \"Green Man\". CATNYP introduces us to the protagnonist Neef & her friend Fleet; \"Grand Central Park\" gives us the Central Park Genius Loci (the seriously Big Bad here) & the fairy Bugle (mentioned in passing in Changeling). I liked both those stories; I loved the idea of New York Between. Unfortunately... Like others have stated here, I just couldn't warm up to Neef. Neef is a changeling, a human child stolen by Faery to live in New York Between, the modern day version of the Sidhe Realms, and the Faery left a substitute in the human world in Neef's place. When this story opens, we're thrown right into the Faery Realm & Neef's world right from the start -- she lives with her fairy godmother, a white rat named Astris, and Neef's being a typical human young teen: bored, wanting adventure, and tired of all the obvious secrets the adults aren't telling her. We're never given a reason for the secrets, by the way. When Neef finally finds out that the Ruling Fairy of Central Park has laid a geas on Neef (Neef is not allowed to ever dance at the Summer Solstice, and she finds out about the geas by unwittingly breaking it), it's not only the first time Neef has ever heard about this, but no explanation is ever given for why that rule was so important. Worse, the Central Park Genius (the ruler of the Park area of New York Between) promptly puts Neef under the equivalent of a death sentence for breaking said geas...which Neef never knew about to begin with because all the Faery folks around her won't\/can't tell her, and we're STILL never given a reason why it's so important. I mean, I get it, okay, Faery rules are arbitrary and nonsensical -- but that usually means they're just nonsensical to us humans. The Faery should have a reason for their rules beyond \"just because\": do they hate rudeness? Is politeness mandatory in Faery politicking? Are mortal dangerous to the Solstice? Is it needed because of certain magics? Nope, the Park Genius just laid that geas on Neef when Neef was just a baby, the day she was stolen into Faery, and geased everyone else to never tell why. No reason. Just because. The whole \"just because it's Faery\" reasoning gets damn thin before the first chapter ends. By the time the Park Genius banishes Neef from Central Park for breaking a rule she didn't know about & that no one could even tell her about...couldn't Sherman think of any better explanation than \"just because\"? At that point, I was wondering why Neef even bothered to want to try to lift the banishment, let alone remain in Faery. Sherman unwittingly has shown us that Faery is an abusive home, with Neef being blamed for the Faery's abuse because of \"her actions\" -- Neef doesn't come right out and apologize for making the Faeries abuse her & kick her out of her only home & try to kill her, but dammit, I was fully expecting her to. And since Sherman has Neef putting up with all this & wanting to go home despite everything, with Neef's Faery abusers giving her a big welcome at the end, it's obvious that Sherman had no clue of the abusive subtext in her writing -- this despite writing for several of the Datlow\/Windling anthologies that explicitly posit faery tales as survival stories for abused kids. What's worse? At one point, Neef meets her Changeling, the Fairy made to look like Neef & left in Neef's place in the human world. Neef makes it plain that she considers Changeling to be a useless load. She only helps Changeling escape a nest of monsters because Changeling knows\/shares Neef's True Name; Neef refuses to help any of the other trapped children who are literally **reaching out & begging for help**, and Neef makes it very plain that she simply does not care about them nor feel any sympathy. Not once does Neef show any sympathy for Changeling, either, despite Changling having been stolen from her home & loving parents. Neef considers Changling as a useless annoyance...until Changeling turns out to be able to provide something Neef needs in her quest. By the way, Sherman describes Changeling's quirks and habits in detail, and makes it plain throughout the story that all the other Faeries think Changeling is useless, unfit, & the lowest of the low, implying that's why they stole Neef & left Changeling in the human world. It's very obvious that Changeling is meant to be autistic. So. Implying that the \"true\" Neef isn't autistic? That autistic folks are not only inhuman changelings, but imperfect copies, unwanted in faery & considered useless...until they have something someone wants? Sherman, did you even think about what you were writing? Again, why does Neef want to stay with these unfriendly, arbitrary, sociopathic, abusive Faeries?? The longer the story went on, the more unfair crap that kept getting piled on top of Neef for no reason beyond \"it's just the way the Faery are\" (yeah, and family members justify their abusers' crap with \"it's just the way they are\" in order to make the victims shut up)...jesus christ on his fuckin' pogo stick, I was waiting for Neef to flip off the entire Faery Court & return to our world with Changeling. Look, a \"just because\" works in a short story. There's not much space to explain a lot. But in a novel, it doesn't work. In the short story CATNYP, the Faery Snowbell takes exception to Neef questioning Faery \"love\"; ok, fine, Snow's a prickly, proud faery who felt challenged by Neef. We get that. Then we're told \"the stacks are dangerous\", and we're also told and shown why! So it makes sense when the NYPL Genius tells Neef \"stay out of the stacks\". The other rules he gives her make similar sense: food can damage the books, disturbances interrupt other folks' use of the library. But in \"Changeling\", none of the rules make sense. Neef's blind acceptance of the shit Faery puts on her makes no sense. Neef being told to \"take responsibility\" for something no one could tell her about, something she was actively put to sleep against her will over whenever the situation came up...and then Neef is blamed when Faery wants to kill her over the rules she wasn't allowed to be told?? Yeah, the abuse was all her fault. She was asking for it. Neef needs to apologize to the folks who want to kill her. How dare she not accept responsibility for everyone treating her like shit! Y'know, Sherman, my parents pulled shit like this, too. I got in trouble over weird arbitrary rules that I didn't know existed until the parents were screaming in my face. I got in trouble & punished over things that should've been the adults' reponsibility to take care of, not a young child's. That's called ABUSE, Sherman. It doesn't matter whether it's Faery or Human."

        "text":"Imaginative, playful, and jam packed full of fae mythology— Changeling by Delia Sherman is a middle grade book this adult is not ashamed to admit his bookshelf will always have a place for. If you hadn’t already guessed, this was a reread for me. Changeling is actually the book that made me fall in love with reading. If you can remember the scholastic book fair days, Changeling was a random book I begged my Mom for because the cover art looked cool. I’ve read this book three times throughout my life, but this was the first time reading this book as an adult. This brought back all the nostalgia I could have hoped for and I can see why I loved it so much. I’ve recently just read Emily Wilde’s Encyclopedia of Fairies and Emily Wilde’s Map of the Otherlands (which have now become one of my new favorite book series) and I was surprised to see how many similarities there were. Changeling to me feels like the mischievous middle-grade baby of the Emily Wilde series and Night at the Museum . In Changeling , we follow Neef, the human counterpart of a fae changeling swap, as she traverses the fae world she was stolen away to, New York-Between—a replica of the New York we know, but with a magical twist. I love traveling in this world with Neef, learning more about Fae from different cultures and mythologies. The amount of fae we are introduced to in such a short amount of time and from such a wide range of cultures without finding it confusing is an amazing feat. I feel like there are so many fantasy books that don’t explain themselves well enough to understand how it works, so the concept isn’t given the breathing room for the reader to really take in a proper lung-full. The fae Geniuses and the domains they rule, the hierarchy of the species, and the uniqueness of each area was detailed very well. I knew where I was the entire time and I hardly ever found myself questioning the magic. One of the coolest concepts that Sherman has created in this world are the fae creatures that come from beloved tales, books, or stories. These characters became so well known and are so loved by humans that they poof into the reality of New-York between—they literally are manifested into being from their popularity. A few examples are Stuart Little and Eloise from the book series. How cool is that? There is a darkness to it that I love (one of the reasons I see a similarity to Emily Wilde’s Encyclopedia of Fairies ), at least a darkness that is hinted towards. Neef doesn’t beat around the bush, much like a New Yorker, whether an in-betweener or not. There were too many grammatical mistakes to overlook. A few mistakes can be easy to look past as a reader, but there were so many mistakes here that made me pause and think too often. I was swept out of this world too often. Sherman established Neef as a fairy changeling who was stolen from the human world and therefore doesn’t have an extensive understanding of that world. But, it felt like Sherman picked and chose too often what knowledge Neef has of the human world and what she doesn’t for convenience sake, whether it be a joke or to push the plot forward. This stripped the believability of Neef and the beautiful world has been built. Changeling isn’t the most complicated read, but this isn’t a bad thing. If you can look past the periodic grammatical oversights and the inconsistencies of Neef’s human knowledge, this truly is a fae fantasy book worth reading. I love Sherman's world and I look forward to the next time I need my next hit of fantastical nostalgia. 3.5\/5 stars , worth rounding up to 4 for Goodreads. Would I Recommend this Book: Yes Would I Read Other Works by the Author (Sequels or otherwise): Yes Would I Ever Reread this Book: Yes"

        "text":"I would’ve enjoyed this story more if I was in middle school. As it is, all the right elements were in the story. It just felt a bit shallow, and as an adult I had a hard time getting over this fact. Neef was exiled from the only home she knew. Which, just to be clear, wasn’t really her home since she’d been kidnapped as a child. Either way, she broke a few rules, and the Genius responsible for that area withdrew her protection. As in, allowed the Hunt to hunt (and presumably eat?) her. So, despite the danger, Neef headed back home to her fairy godmother. Luckily, she was able to escape, and through some lucky turn of events was given a way to get back home. All she had to do was go on a magical quest for three impossible-to-retrieve items, and everything would be good again. It was New York, but combined with mythological creatures, impossible fairy rules, and Neef, a human in a world of fairies, which was a great twist. Anyhow, Neef was given three impossible tasks which would allow her to return to her familiar life. These were impossible tasks, supposedly, but she got them so easily. Two days later, it was all behind her. She found an impossible riddle for the mermaid queen that got her a magical mirror. She fixed bugs on a computer (think, real, live, swarming ones) and was awarded the Broadway tickets she needed. And, she went on an impossible quest to get the dragon’s scales. This last one didn’t work out quite as expected, but she was okay because of a technicality in the quest. And, I was left wondering what I missed. Was every other person who hadn’t succeeded in getting these items stupid? Was Neef just lucky? How did it work out so easily? The story was cute, with many references to the real world, and all the right elements that should've made it a success. And, better yet, Neef was a strong character who wasn’t afraid to take risks, did what was right, and didn’t once rely on a handsome hero to get her out of her mess. But - the world felt forced at times, and one-dimensional at others, and I never connected to Neef or the fairy she was switched for, Changeling, and her ASD behaviors . It was all just too easy. Similar recommendations: Content: Scary moments including kids locked in cages, nearly being eaten by monsters, Neef hunted by the Hunt, creatures offering her wish in return for her body parts. The story only happens because Neef was stolen from her parents, which is treated as perfectly normal. Neef lives among and is friendly with mythological creatures, including goddesses such as Bastet, an Egyptian cat goddess. The mermaid queen has tattoos. Neef’s quest involves going to Broadway and meeting aspiring actors and hearing about various movies.[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>"

        "text":"If you're one of the maybe 3 people who actually read my reviews, I'm sure you've realized by now that I am a sucker for any book\/series that involves Faeries and the fair Folk. As a result, I have read various books by various authors about the Fae, and they have ranged from absolutely amazing and unforgettable (looking at you, Holly Black!) to boring, annoying, and agonizing to read (Sarah J. Maas, please stand up). Changeling falls somewhere in the middle. It's not bad, exactly, just... meh. Neef is a mortal child, stolen from her crib as a baby by the Folk and replaced with one of their own. Raised by her fairy godmother Astris in the Fairies' \"in-between\" world of New York's Central Park, she finds herself thrust back into the humans' version of New York after she breaks a fairy law and must complete several tasks in order to clear her name. To be honest, the characters were the single most disappointing aspect of this book. They are just devastatingly dull. How is it possible that Neef is a literal mortal who was ripped from her parents and raised by fairies, surrounded by their customs, following their rules, and yet she is not in the least bit interesting?? That's actually kind of impressive, to fail so utterly at making such a character not at all relatable or engaging. Luckily, Neef wasn't travelling alone. She was accompanied by the fairy that was left in her place all those years ago, simply known as \"Changeling\". Changeling was, hands down, the best character in the book. She was way more interesting than Neef, very relatable, and just felt so real and believable. I also liked how, while she was completely out of her element in many instances, she was still able to contribute and help Neef on her journey. The rest of the characters were pretty meh, which was a real shame, but it can't be helped. The worldbuilding was where the book was really able to shine. Despite the lack of an engaging protagonist, I found myself immensely enjoying their journey and the things they saw. The book does a pretty good job of giving you an idea of what these places they're visiting look like, and what the Fairies look like as well. I also liked that, while these Fairies are much more tame than some other depictions have shown, they still indicate that they are not to be trifled with, such as the Fairy that tells Neef he'll sell her a ticket to a Broadway show in exchange for one of her hands. Very dark! I love it! I won't lie, this book was a definite disappointment, mainly because Holly black herself rated it 5 stars so I was really excited to check it out. And again, it's not bad; I did enjoy reading it for the most part. But Neef was just so... blah. 3 stars."

        "text":"I really wanted to LOVE this book but instead, I just liked it. :( From the time I turned 5 and began reading the Wizard of Oz series (Yes, I taught myself to read at the age of 3 using my brother's comic books and my reading level has always been exceedingly high!), I have loved mystical fantasy. This book had it all or so I thought. The beginning of the book was good but then I began to realize that the fairy kingdom was as arrogant as the humans in the real world. The story got a little confusing when Neef discovered her \"double\" who came from the human world and that it was never truly explained whether Neef was the stolen child or if Changeling was the stolen child. Now I will admit that I would probably have LOVED this book if I had read it in my youth. However, at the age of 64 and having seen a bit more of life than I would have liked, I found the book to be not quite so enchanting. (I did just retead the entire Wizard of Oz Series and was enthralled, so it isn't the fact that my love of fantasy has deserted me). I just didn't feel a kinship with any of the characters. In fact, Neef and Changeling were rather boring. The fact that they were pretty much the only 2 characters that got any action could have been part of the problem for me. A child would enjoy reading this book or having it read to her\/him, I'm sure. But even if you're bored like I was, I would tell you not to read this book and instead give it to someone of the age it was written for."

It is structured in your basic 'magical middle grade quest' arc that fans of Rick Riordan will be familiar with, but Changeling and Neef are both characters and I love how they play off each other. I particularly liked how Changeling exhibited several kind of autistic behaviors [even though it's never discussed explicitly in the text] because a lot of the reasons that people historically would accuse someone of being a changeling would be because they were acting 'weird' and expressing behaviors now associated with autism although they obviously didn't have a name for it back then but I thought that was a nice little touch. I also liked how the author updated a lot of the 'classic' fairy tales to fit into modern New York life, like Jack and the Beanstalk became Jack and the Extension ladder, and having fairies hold domain over things like Broadway and Wall Street instead of more traditional fairy knowes. Definitely going to be checking out the next book!"

The story follows a changeling girl, Neef (not her real name), who lives in an interesting New York that lives between worlds, filled with all the mythical creatures from all your favorite storybooks. Neef is driven by her need for adventure and her desperation for her own kind, being the only changeling as far as she knows in Central Park, her home. Little does she know how much of both she'll get. Join me on this beautiful blend of modern and traditional fantasy that Changeling embodies in full."

        "text":"First, this book is in the same world as Delia Sherman's \"CATNYP\" from the Datlow\/Windling \"The Faery Reel\" anthology & \"Grand Central Park\" from Datlow\/Windling's \"Green Man\". CATNYP introduces us to the protagnonist Neef & her friend Fleet; \"Grand Central Park\" gives us the Central Park Genius Loci (the seriously Big Bad here) & the fairy Bugle (mentioned in passing in Changeling). I liked both those stories; I loved the idea of New York Between. Unfortunately... Like others have stated here, I just couldn't warm up to Neef. Neef is a changeling, a human child stolen by Faery to live in New York Between, the modern day version of the Sidhe Realms, and the Faery left a substitute in the human world in Neef's place. When this story opens, we're thrown right into the Faery Realm & Neef's world right from the start -- she lives with her fairy godmother, a white rat named Astris, and Neef's being a typical human young teen: bored, wanting adventure, and tired of all the obvious secrets the adults aren't telling her. We're never given a reason for the secrets, by the way. When Neef finally finds out that the Ruling Fairy of Central Park has laid a geas on Neef (Neef is not allowed to ever dance at the Summer Solstice, and she finds out about the geas by unwittingly breaking it), it's not only the first time Neef has ever heard about this, but no explanation is ever given for why that rule was so important. Worse, the Central Park Genius (the ruler of the Park area of New York Between) promptly puts Neef under the equivalent of a death sentence for breaking said geas...which Neef never knew about to begin with because all the Faery folks around her won't\/can't tell her, and we're STILL never given a reason why it's so important. I mean, I get it, okay, Faery rules are arbitrary and nonsensical -- but that usually means they're just nonsensical to us humans. The Faery should have a reason for their rules beyond \"just because\": do they hate rudeness? Is politeness mandatory in Faery politicking? Are mortal dangerous to the Solstice? Is it needed because of certain magics? Nope, the Park Genius just laid that geas on Neef when Neef was just a baby, the day she was stolen into Faery, and geased everyone else to never tell why. No reason. Just because. The whole \"just because it's Faery\" reasoning gets damn thin before the first chapter ends. By the time the Park Genius banishes Neef from Central Park for breaking a rule she didn't know about & that no one could even tell her about...couldn't Sherman think of any better explanation than \"just because\"? At that point, I was wondering why Neef even bothered to want to try to lift the banishment, let alone remain in Faery. Sherman unwittingly has shown us that Faery is an abusive home, with Neef being blamed for the Faery's abuse because of \"her actions\" -- Neef doesn't come right out and apologize for making the Faeries abuse her & kick her out of her only home & try to kill her, but dammit, I was fully expecting her to. And since Sherman has Neef putting up with all this & wanting to go home despite everything, with Neef's Faery abusers giving her a big welcome at the end, it's obvious that Sherman had no clue of the abusive subtext in her writing -- this despite writing for several of the Datlow\/Windling anthologies that explicitly posit faery tales as survival stories for abused kids. What's worse? At one point, Neef meets her Changeling, the Fairy made to look like Neef & left in Neef's place in the human world. Neef makes it plain that she considers Changeling to be a useless load. She only helps Changeling escape a nest of monsters because Changeling knows\/shares Neef's True Name; Neef refuses to help any of the other trapped children who are literally **reaching out & begging for help**, and Neef makes it very plain that she simply does not care about them nor feel any sympathy. Not once does Neef show any sympathy for Changeling, either, despite Changling having been stolen from her home & loving parents. Neef considers Changling as a useless annoyance...until Changeling turns out to be able to provide something Neef needs in her quest. By the way, Sherman describes Changeling's quirks and habits in detail, and makes it plain throughout the story that all the other Faeries think Changeling is useless, unfit, & the lowest of the low, implying that's why they stole Neef & left Changeling in the human world. It's very obvious that Changeling is meant to be autistic. So. Implying that the \"true\" Neef isn't autistic? That autistic folks are not only inhuman changelings, but imperfect copies, unwanted in faery & considered useless...until they have something someone wants? Sherman, did you even think about what you were writing? Again, why does Neef want to stay with these unfriendly, arbitrary, sociopathic, abusive Faeries?? The longer the story went on, the more unfair crap that kept getting piled on top of Neef for no reason beyond \"it's just the way the Faery are\" (yeah, and family members justify their abusers' crap with \"it's just the way they are\" in order to make the victims shut up)...jesus christ on his fuckin' pogo stick, I was waiting for Neef to flip off the entire Faery Court & return to our world with Changeling. Look, a \"just because\" works in a short story. There's not much space to explain a lot. But in a novel, it doesn't work. In the short story CATNYP, the Faery Snowbell takes exception to Neef questioning Faery \"love\"; ok, fine, Snow's a prickly, proud faery who felt challenged by Neef. We get that. Then we're told \"the stacks are dangerous\", and we're also told and shown why! So it makes sense when the NYPL Genius tells Neef \"stay out of the stacks\". The other rules he gives her make similar sense: food can damage the books, disturbances interrupt other folks' use of the library. But in \"Changeling\", none of the rules make sense. Neef's blind acceptance of the shit Faery puts on her makes no sense. Neef being told to \"take responsibility\" for something no one could tell her about, something she was actively put to sleep against her will over whenever the situation came up...and then Neef is blamed when Faery wants to kill her over the rules she wasn't allowed to be told?? Yeah, the abuse was all her fault. She was asking for it. Neef needs to apologize to the folks who want to kill her. How dare she not accept responsibility for everyone treating her like shit! Y'know, Sherman, my parents pulled shit like this, too. I got in trouble over weird arbitrary rules that I didn't know existed until the parents were screaming in my face. I got in trouble & punished over things that should've been the adults' reponsibility to take care of, not a young child's. That's called ABUSE, Sherman. It doesn't matter whether it's Faery or Human."

        "text":"Imaginative, playful, and jam packed full of fae mythology— Changeling by Delia Sherman is a middle grade book this adult is not ashamed to admit his bookshelf will always have a place for. If you hadn’t already guessed, this was a reread for me. Changeling is actually the book that made me fall in love with reading. If you can remember the scholastic book fair days, Changeling was a random book I begged my Mom for because the cover art looked cool. I’ve read this book three times throughout my life, but this was the first time reading this book as an adult. This brought back all the nostalgia I could have hoped for and I can see why I loved it so much. I’ve recently just read Emily Wilde’s Encyclopedia of Fairies and Emily Wilde’s Map of the Otherlands (which have now become one of my new favorite book series) and I was surprised to see how many similarities there were. Changeling to me feels like the mischievous middle-grade baby of the Emily Wilde series and Night at the Museum . In Changeling , we follow Neef, the human counterpart of a fae changeling swap, as she traverses the fae world she was stolen away to, New York-Between—a replica of the New York we know, but with a magical twist. I love traveling in this world with Neef, learning more about Fae from different cultures and mythologies. The amount of fae we are introduced to in such a short amount of time and from such a wide range of cultures without finding it confusing is an amazing feat. I feel like there are so many fantasy books that don’t explain themselves well enough to understand how it works, so the concept isn’t given the breathing room for the reader to really take in a proper lung-full. The fae Geniuses and the domains they rule, the hierarchy of the species, and the uniqueness of each area was detailed very well. I knew where I was the entire time and I hardly ever found myself questioning the magic. One of the coolest concepts that Sherman has created in this world are the fae creatures that come from beloved tales, books, or stories. These characters became so well known and are so loved by humans that they poof into the reality of New-York between—they literally are manifested into being from their popularity. A few examples are Stuart Little and Eloise from the book series. How cool is that? There is a darkness to it that I love (one of the reasons I see a similarity to Emily Wilde’s Encyclopedia of Fairies ), at least a darkness that is hinted towards. Neef doesn’t beat around the bush, much like a New Yorker, whether an in-betweener or not. There were too many grammatical mistakes to overlook. A few mistakes can be easy to look past as a reader, but there were so many mistakes here that made me pause and think too often. I was swept out of this world too often. Sherman established Neef as a fairy changeling who was stolen from the human world and therefore doesn’t have an extensive understanding of that world. But, it felt like Sherman picked and chose too often what knowledge Neef has of the human world and what she doesn’t for convenience sake, whether it be a joke or to push the plot forward. This stripped the believability of Neef and the beautiful world has been built. Changeling isn’t the most complicated read, but this isn’t a bad thing. If you can look past the periodic grammatical oversights and the inconsistencies of Neef’s human knowledge, this truly is a fae fantasy book worth reading. I love Sherman's world and I look forward to the next time I need my next hit of fantastical nostalgia. 3.5\/5 stars , worth rounding up to 4 for Goodreads. Would I Recommend this Book: Yes Would I Read Other Works by the Author (Sequels or otherwise): Yes Would I Ever Reread this Book: Yes"

        "text":"I would’ve enjoyed this story more if I was in middle school. As it is, all the right elements were in the story. It just felt a bit shallow, and as an adult I had a hard time getting over this fact. Neef was exiled from the only home she knew. Which, just to be clear, wasn’t really her home since she’d been kidnapped as a child. Either way, she broke a few rules, and the Genius responsible for that area withdrew her protection. As in, allowed the Hunt to hunt (and presumably eat?) her. So, despite the danger, Neef headed back home to her fairy godmother. Luckily, she was able to escape, and through some lucky turn of events was given a way to get back home. All she had to do was go on a magical quest for three impossible-to-retrieve items, and everything would be good again. It was New York, but combined with mythological creatures, impossible fairy rules, and Neef, a human in a world of fairies, which was a great twist. Anyhow, Neef was given three impossible tasks which would allow her to return to her familiar life. These were impossible tasks, supposedly, but she got them so easily. Two days later, it was all behind her. She found an impossible riddle for the mermaid queen that got her a magical mirror. She fixed bugs on a computer (think, real, live, swarming ones) and was awarded the Broadway tickets she needed. And, she went on an impossible quest to get the dragon’s scales. This last one didn’t work out quite as expected, but she was okay because of a technicality in the quest. And, I was left wondering what I missed. Was every other person who hadn’t succeeded in getting these items stupid? Was Neef just lucky? How did it work out so easily? The story was cute, with many references to the real world, and all the right elements that should've made it a success. And, better yet, Neef was a strong character who wasn’t afraid to take risks, did what was right, and didn’t once rely on a handsome hero to get her out of her mess. But - the world felt forced at times, and one-dimensional at others, and I never connected to Neef or the fairy she was switched for, Changeling, and her ASD behaviors . It was all just too easy. Similar recommendations: Content: Scary moments including kids locked in cages, nearly being eaten by monsters, Neef hunted by the Hunt, creatures offering her wish in return for her body parts. The story only happens because Neef was stolen from her parents, which is treated as perfectly normal. Neef lives among and is friendly with mythological creatures, including goddesses such as Bastet, an Egyptian cat goddess. The mermaid queen has tattoos. Neef’s quest involves going to Broadway and meeting aspiring actors and hearing about various movies.[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>"

        "text":"If you're one of the maybe 3 people who actually read my reviews, I'm sure you've realized by now that I am a sucker for any book\/series that involves Faeries and the fair Folk. As a result, I have read various books by various authors about the Fae, and they have ranged from absolutely amazing and unforgettable (looking at you, Holly Black!) to boring, annoying, and agonizing to read (Sarah J. Maas, please stand up). Changeling falls somewhere in the middle. It's not bad, exactly, just... meh. Neef is a mortal child, stolen from her crib as a baby by the Folk and replaced with one of their own. Raised by her fairy godmother Astris in the Fairies' \"in-between\" world of New York's Central Park, she finds herself thrust back into the humans' version of New York after she breaks a fairy law and must complete several tasks in order to clear her name. To be honest, the characters were the single most disappointing aspect of this book. They are just devastatingly dull. How is it possible that Neef is a literal mortal who was ripped from her parents and raised by fairies, surrounded by their customs, following their rules, and yet she is not in the least bit interesting?? That's actually kind of impressive, to fail so utterly at making such a character not at all relatable or engaging. Luckily, Neef wasn't travelling alone. She was accompanied by the fairy that was left in her place all those years ago, simply known as \"Changeling\". Changeling was, hands down, the best character in the book. She was way more interesting than Neef, very relatable, and just felt so real and believable. I also liked how, while she was completely out of her element in many instances, she was still able to contribute and help Neef on her journey. The rest of the characters were pretty meh, which was a real shame, but it can't be helped. The worldbuilding was where the book was really able to shine. Despite the lack of an engaging protagonist, I found myself immensely enjoying their journey and the things they saw. The book does a pretty good job of giving you an idea of what these places they're visiting look like, and what the Fairies look like as well. I also liked that, while these Fairies are much more tame than some other depictions have shown, they still indicate that they are not to be trifled with, such as the Fairy that tells Neef he'll sell her a ticket to a Broadway show in exchange for one of her hands. Very dark! I love it! I won't lie, this book was a definite disappointment, mainly because Holly black herself rated it 5 stars so I was really excited to check it out. And again, it's not bad; I did enjoy reading it for the most part. But Neef was just so... blah. 3 stars."

        "text":"I really wanted to LOVE this book but instead, I just liked it. :( From the time I turned 5 and began reading the Wizard of Oz series (Yes, I taught myself to read at the age of 3 using my brother's comic books and my reading level has always been exceedingly high!), I have loved mystical fantasy. This book had it all or so I thought. The beginning of the book was good but then I began to realize that the fairy kingdom was as arrogant as the humans in the real world. The story got a little confusing when Neef discovered her \"double\" who came from the human world and that it was never truly explained whether Neef was the stolen child or if Changeling was the stolen child. Now I will admit that I would probably have LOVED this book if I had read it in my youth. However, at the age of 64 and having seen a bit more of life than I would have liked, I found the book to be not quite so enchanting. (I did just retead the entire Wizard of Oz Series and was enthralled, so it isn't the fact that my love of fantasy has deserted me). I just didn't feel a kinship with any of the characters. In fact, Neef and Changeling were rather boring. The fact that they were pretty much the only 2 characters that got any action could have been part of the problem for me. A child would enjoy reading this book or having it read to her\/him, I'm sure. But even if you're bored like I was, I would tell you not to read this book and instead give it to someone of the age it was written for."

It is structured in your basic 'magical middle grade quest' arc that fans of Rick Riordan will be familiar with, but Changeling and Neef are both characters and I love how they play off each other. I particularly liked how Changeling exhibited several kind of autistic behaviors [even though it's never discussed explicitly in the text] because a lot of the reasons that people historically would accuse someone of being a changeling would be because they were acting 'weird' and expressing behaviors now associated with autism although they obviously didn't have a name for it back then but I thought that was a nice little touch. I also liked how the author updated a lot of the 'classic' fairy tales to fit into modern New York life, like Jack and the Beanstalk became Jack and the Extension ladder, and having fairies hold domain over things like Broadway and Wall Street instead of more traditional fairy knowes. Definitely going to be checking out the next book!"

The story follows a changeling girl, Neef (not her real name), who lives in an interesting New York that lives between worlds, filled with all the mythical creatures from all your favorite storybooks. Neef is driven by her need for adventure and her desperation for her own kind, being the only changeling as far as she knows in Central Park, her home. Little does she know how much of both she'll get. Join me on this beautiful blend of modern and traditional fantasy that Changeling embodies in full."

        "text":"First, this book is in the same world as Delia Sherman's \"CATNYP\" from the Datlow\/Windling \"The Faery Reel\" anthology & \"Grand Central Park\" from Datlow\/Windling's \"Green Man\". CATNYP introduces us to the protagnonist Neef & her friend Fleet; \"Grand Central Park\" gives us the Central Park Genius Loci (the seriously Big Bad here) & the fairy Bugle (mentioned in passing in Changeling). I liked both those stories; I loved the idea of New York Between. Unfortunately... Like others have stated here, I just couldn't warm up to Neef. Neef is a changeling, a human child stolen by Faery to live in New York Between, the modern day version of the Sidhe Realms, and the Faery left a substitute in the human world in Neef's place. When this story opens, we're thrown right into the Faery Realm & Neef's world right from the start -- she lives with her fairy godmother, a white rat named Astris, and Neef's being a typical human young teen: bored, wanting adventure, and tired of all the obvious secrets the adults aren't telling her. We're never given a reason for the secrets, by the way. When Neef finally finds out that the Ruling Fairy of Central Park has laid a geas on Neef (Neef is not allowed to ever dance at the Summer Solstice, and she finds out about the geas by unwittingly breaking it), it's not only the first time Neef has ever heard about this, but no explanation is ever given for why that rule was so important. Worse, the Central Park Genius (the ruler of the Park area of New York Between) promptly puts Neef under the equivalent of a death sentence for breaking said geas...which Neef never knew about to begin with because all the Faery folks around her won't\/can't tell her, and we're STILL never given a reason why it's so important. I mean, I get it, okay, Faery rules are arbitrary and nonsensical -- but that usually means they're just nonsensical to us humans. The Faery should have a reason for their rules beyond \"just because\": do they hate rudeness? Is politeness mandatory in Faery politicking? Are mortal dangerous to the Solstice? Is it needed because of certain magics? Nope, the Park Genius just laid that geas on Neef when Neef was just a baby, the day she was stolen into Faery, and geased everyone else to never tell why. No reason. Just because. The whole \"just because it's Faery\" reasoning gets damn thin before the first chapter ends. By the time the Park Genius banishes Neef from Central Park for breaking a rule she didn't know about & that no one could even tell her about...couldn't Sherman think of any better explanation than \"just because\"? At that point, I was wondering why Neef even bothered to want to try to lift the banishment, let alone remain in Faery. Sherman unwittingly has shown us that Faery is an abusive home, with Neef being blamed for the Faery's abuse because of \"her actions\" -- Neef doesn't come right out and apologize for making the Faeries abuse her & kick her out of her only home & try to kill her, but dammit, I was fully expecting her to. And since Sherman has Neef putting up with all this & wanting to go home despite everything, with Neef's Faery abusers giving her a big welcome at the end, it's obvious that Sherman had no clue of the abusive subtext in her writing -- this despite writing for several of the Datlow\/Windling anthologies that explicitly posit faery tales as survival stories for abused kids. What's worse? At one point, Neef meets her Changeling, the Fairy made to look like Neef & left in Neef's place in the human world. Neef makes it plain that she considers Changeling to be a useless load. She only helps Changeling escape a nest of monsters because Changeling knows\/shares Neef's True Name; Neef refuses to help any of the other trapped children who are literally **reaching out & begging for help**, and Neef makes it very plain that she simply does not care about them nor feel any sympathy. Not once does Neef show any sympathy for Changeling, either, despite Changling having been stolen from her home & loving parents. Neef considers Changling as a useless annoyance...until Changeling turns out to be able to provide something Neef needs in her quest. By the way, Sherman describes Changeling's quirks and habits in detail, and makes it plain throughout the story that all the other Faeries think Changeling is useless, unfit, & the lowest of the low, implying that's why they stole Neef & left Changeling in the human world. It's very obvious that Changeling is meant to be autistic. So. Implying that the \"true\" Neef isn't autistic? That autistic folks are not only inhuman changelings, but imperfect copies, unwanted in faery & considered useless...until they have something someone wants? Sherman, did you even think about what you were writing? Again, why does Neef want to stay with these unfriendly, arbitrary, sociopathic, abusive Faeries?? The longer the story went on, the more unfair crap that kept getting piled on top of Neef for no reason beyond \"it's just the way the Faery are\" (yeah, and family members justify their abusers' crap with \"it's just the way they are\" in order to make the victims shut up)...jesus christ on his fuckin' pogo stick, I was waiting for Neef to flip off the entire Faery Court & return to our world with Changeling. Look, a \"just because\" works in a short story. There's not much space to explain a lot. But in a novel, it doesn't work. In the short story CATNYP, the Faery Snowbell takes exception to Neef questioning Faery \"love\"; ok, fine, Snow's a prickly, proud faery who felt challenged by Neef. We get that. Then we're told \"the stacks are dangerous\", and we're also told and shown why! So it makes sense when the NYPL Genius tells Neef \"stay out of the stacks\". The other rules he gives her make similar sense: food can damage the books, disturbances interrupt other folks' use of the library. But in \"Changeling\", none of the rules make sense. Neef's blind acceptance of the shit Faery puts on her makes no sense. Neef being told to \"take responsibility\" for something no one could tell her about, something she was actively put to sleep against her will over whenever the situation came up...and then Neef is blamed when Faery wants to kill her over the rules she wasn't allowed to be told?? Yeah, the abuse was all her fault. She was asking for it. Neef needs to apologize to the folks who want to kill her. How dare she not accept responsibility for everyone treating her like shit! Y'know, Sherman, my parents pulled shit like this, too. I got in trouble over weird arbitrary rules that I didn't know existed until the parents were screaming in my face. I got in trouble & punished over things that should've been the adults' reponsibility to take care of, not a young child's. That's called ABUSE, Sherman. It doesn't matter whether it's Faery or Human."

        "text":"Imaginative, playful, and jam packed full of fae mythology— Changeling by Delia Sherman is a middle grade book this adult is not ashamed to admit his bookshelf will always have a place for. If you hadn’t already guessed, this was a reread for me. Changeling is actually the book that made me fall in love with reading. If you can remember the scholastic book fair days, Changeling was a random book I begged my Mom for because the cover art looked cool. I’ve read this book three times throughout my life, but this was the first time reading this book as an adult. This brought back all the nostalgia I could have hoped for and I can see why I loved it so much. I’ve recently just read Emily Wilde’s Encyclopedia of Fairies and Emily Wilde’s Map of the Otherlands (which have now become one of my new favorite book series) and I was surprised to see how many similarities there were. Changeling to me feels like the mischievous middle-grade baby of the Emily Wilde series and Night at the Museum . In Changeling , we follow Neef, the human counterpart of a fae changeling swap, as she traverses the fae world she was stolen away to, New York-Between—a replica of the New York we know, but with a magical twist. I love traveling in this world with Neef, learning more about Fae from different cultures and mythologies. The amount of fae we are introduced to in such a short amount of time and from such a wide range of cultures without finding it confusing is an amazing feat. I feel like there are so many fantasy books that don’t explain themselves well enough to understand how it works, so the concept isn’t given the breathing room for the reader to really take in a proper lung-full. The fae Geniuses and the domains they rule, the hierarchy of the species, and the uniqueness of each area was detailed very well. I knew where I was the entire time and I hardly ever found myself questioning the magic. One of the coolest concepts that Sherman has created in this world are the fae creatures that come from beloved tales, books, or stories. These characters became so well known and are so loved by humans that they poof into the reality of New-York between—they literally are manifested into being from their popularity. A few examples are Stuart Little and Eloise from the book series. How cool is that? There is a darkness to it that I love (one of the reasons I see a similarity to Emily Wilde’s Encyclopedia of Fairies ), at least a darkness that is hinted towards. Neef doesn’t beat around the bush, much like a New Yorker, whether an in-betweener or not. There were too many grammatical mistakes to overlook. A few mistakes can be easy to look past as a reader, but there were so many mistakes here that made me pause and think too often. I was swept out of this world too often. Sherman established Neef as a fairy changeling who was stolen from the human world and therefore doesn’t have an extensive understanding of that world. But, it felt like Sherman picked and chose too often what knowledge Neef has of the human world and what she doesn’t for convenience sake, whether it be a joke or to push the plot forward. This stripped the believability of Neef and the beautiful world has been built. Changeling isn’t the most complicated read, but this isn’t a bad thing. If you can look past the periodic grammatical oversights and the inconsistencies of Neef’s human knowledge, this truly is a fae fantasy book worth reading. I love Sherman's world and I look forward to the next time I need my next hit of fantastical nostalgia. 3.5\/5 stars , worth rounding up to 4 for Goodreads. Would I Recommend this Book: Yes Would I Read Other Works by the Author (Sequels or otherwise): Yes Would I Ever Reread this Book: Yes"

        "text":"I would’ve enjoyed this story more if I was in middle school. As it is, all the right elements were in the story. It just felt a bit shallow, and as an adult I had a hard time getting over this fact. Neef was exiled from the only home she knew. Which, just to be clear, wasn’t really her home since she’d been kidnapped as a child. Either way, she broke a few rules, and the Genius responsible for that area withdrew her protection. As in, allowed the Hunt to hunt (and presumably eat?) her. So, despite the danger, Neef headed back home to her fairy godmother. Luckily, she was able to escape, and through some lucky turn of events was given a way to get back home. All she had to do was go on a magical quest for three impossible-to-retrieve items, and everything would be good again. It was New York, but combined with mythological creatures, impossible fairy rules, and Neef, a human in a world of fairies, which was a great twist. Anyhow, Neef was given three impossible tasks which would allow her to return to her familiar life. These were impossible tasks, supposedly, but she got them so easily. Two days later, it was all behind her. She found an impossible riddle for the mermaid queen that got her a magical mirror. She fixed bugs on a computer (think, real, live, swarming ones) and was awarded the Broadway tickets she needed. And, she went on an impossible quest to get the dragon’s scales. This last one didn’t work out quite as expected, but she was okay because of a technicality in the quest. And, I was left wondering what I missed. Was every other person who hadn’t succeeded in getting these items stupid? Was Neef just lucky? How did it work out so easily? The story was cute, with many references to the real world, and all the right elements that should've made it a success. And, better yet, Neef was a strong character who wasn’t afraid to take risks, did what was right, and didn’t once rely on a handsome hero to get her out of her mess. But - the world felt forced at times, and one-dimensional at others, and I never connected to Neef or the fairy she was switched for, Changeling, and her ASD behaviors . It was all just too easy. Similar recommendations: Content: Scary moments including kids locked in cages, nearly being eaten by monsters, Neef hunted by the Hunt, creatures offering her wish in return for her body parts. The story only happens because Neef was stolen from her parents, which is treated as perfectly normal. Neef lives among and is friendly with mythological creatures, including goddesses such as Bastet, an Egyptian cat goddess. The mermaid queen has tattoos. Neef’s quest involves going to Broadway and meeting aspiring actors and hearing about various movies.[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>"

        "text":"If you're one of the maybe 3 people who actually read my reviews, I'm sure you've realized by now that I am a sucker for any book\/series that involves Faeries and the fair Folk. As a result, I have read various books by various authors about the Fae, and they have ranged from absolutely amazing and unforgettable (looking at you, Holly Black!) to boring, annoying, and agonizing to read (Sarah J. Maas, please stand up). Changeling falls somewhere in the middle. It's not bad, exactly, just... meh. Neef is a mortal child, stolen from her crib as a baby by the Folk and replaced with one of their own. Raised by her fairy godmother Astris in the Fairies' \"in-between\" world of New York's Central Park, she finds herself thrust back into the humans' version of New York after she breaks a fairy law and must complete several tasks in order to clear her name. To be honest, the characters were the single most disappointing aspect of this book. They are just devastatingly dull. How is it possible that Neef is a literal mortal who was ripped from her parents and raised by fairies, surrounded by their customs, following their rules, and yet she is not in the least bit interesting?? That's actually kind of impressive, to fail so utterly at making such a character not at all relatable or engaging. Luckily, Neef wasn't travelling alone. She was accompanied by the fairy that was left in her place all those years ago, simply known as \"Changeling\". Changeling was, hands down, the best character in the book. She was way more interesting than Neef, very relatable, and just felt so real and believable. I also liked how, while she was completely out of her element in many instances, she was still able to contribute and help Neef on her journey. The rest of the characters were pretty meh, which was a real shame, but it can't be helped. The worldbuilding was where the book was really able to shine. Despite the lack of an engaging protagonist, I found myself immensely enjoying their journey and the things they saw. The book does a pretty good job of giving you an idea of what these places they're visiting look like, and what the Fairies look like as well. I also liked that, while these Fairies are much more tame than some other depictions have shown, they still indicate that they are not to be trifled with, such as the Fairy that tells Neef he'll sell her a ticket to a Broadway show in exchange for one of her hands. Very dark! I love it! I won't lie, this book was a definite disappointment, mainly because Holly black herself rated it 5 stars so I was really excited to check it out. And again, it's not bad; I did enjoy reading it for the most part. But Neef was just so... blah. 3 stars."

        "text":"I really wanted to LOVE this book but instead, I just liked it. :( From the time I turned 5 and began reading the Wizard of Oz series (Yes, I taught myself to read at the age of 3 using my brother's comic books and my reading level has always been exceedingly high!), I have loved mystical fantasy. This book had it all or so I thought. The beginning of the book was good but then I began to realize that the fairy kingdom was as arrogant as the humans in the real world. The story got a little confusing when Neef discovered her \"double\" who came from the human world and that it was never truly explained whether Neef was the stolen child or if Changeling was the stolen child. Now I will admit that I would probably have LOVED this book if I had read it in my youth. However, at the age of 64 and having seen a bit more of life than I would have liked, I found the book to be not quite so enchanting. (I did just retead the entire Wizard of Oz Series and was enthralled, so it isn't the fact that my love of fantasy has deserted me). I just didn't feel a kinship with any of the characters. In fact, Neef and Changeling were rather boring. The fact that they were pretty much the only 2 characters that got any action could have been part of the problem for me. A child would enjoy reading this book or having it read to her\/him, I'm sure. But even if you're bored like I was, I would tell you not to read this book and instead give it to someone of the age it was written for."

This is the book that made me fall in love with reading, the very first one I bought with my own savings, more than 10 years ago. It took me half an afternoon to finish it and, once I was done, I immediately went and reread it, skipping homework and totally forgetting about the world outside. I've read it so many times through the years, the pages eventually started to fall off. I remember I found it magical and beautiful, simple and yet complex and intense in its semplicity. It gave me such strong feelings, made my mind and heart travel to places I never thought existed. I often reread it, every now and then, and every time it's like the first time. No matter how great or famous or brilliant or heartbreaking a book is, it will never be as important to me as this one is. I still cherish it and forever will, too.

        "text":"\"What have you done?\" she asked herself aloud. \"What have you done?\" She answered herself a few moments later. \"I've gone and fallen in love with the sea.\" Flawless! Patricia McKillip should give lessons in how to write fantasy romance - imaginative, charming, balancing a tear with a smile, loneliness with selflessness, poetry with the prose of day to day living. She is one of the most consistent writers of modern fairytales I have come across, her lyrical style immediately identifiable, yet bringing something fresh and original with each new book she writes. She infuses even the darker stories with beauty and a sense of wonder, and she turns a deft hand at light comedy when the situation requires it. She felt as if she had stepped into some dream where anything might happen: Her head might float away and turn into the moon; starfish might walk upright onto the sand and dance a courtly dance. Peri, as in Periwinkle, is a young girl who lives in a small village by the sea. When she loses her father in a violent storm, she puts a curse on the cruel sea, throwing into the waves some of her amateurish magical wreaths. Who would believe that a simple scullion girl in the local inn might have the power to awaken terrible forces from their deep blue slumber? Yet soon enough, a magical dragon starts to haunt the sea near the village, a magnificent multicolored beast that is chained to the bottom of the sea by a heavy gold chain. A young man, the obligatory \"tall, dark stranger\", is also haunting the beaches, always looking out to the sea. Pretty soon, another young man will mirror the first one by gazing longingly from the beach towards dry lands. Both of the boys find refuge in the humble hovel of the girl Peri. And spring is coming to the world, awakening in the three young hearts the thoughts of romance. The air was warm, silken, promising longer, lazy days, more light, promising all the soft, mysterious smells and colors of spring after the harsh gray winter. The sand itself was streaked with colors from the sunset. Love triangles have been done to the death in the genre, so expect McKillip to not be satisfied with this classical set-up, and to make Peri a girl with her head screwed the right way onto her shoulders, not too easily swayed by the Heathcliff vibe of tragic destiny in the young bucks coming to her door. Read on, and you might find the resolution of romance to be a logical, if unconventional one. There's a third young man, a young wizard named Lyo, who waits quietly in the background for Peri to realize there's somebody who is not a prince or a tragic hero, yet wants to spend his whole life by her side. The plot is inspired by the old Celtic legends of the Changeling, by the magical realm of the faeries existing hidden beside our own reality, and by the dangers of crossing this invisible barrier between the real and the magical realms. There's a legend like this in the kingdom where Peri lives, a mystery that she unwittingly steps into and must now help to unravel. Once upon a time there was a king who had two sons: one by the young queen, his wife, and one by a woman out of the sea. The sons were born at the same time, and when the queen died in child-bed, her human son was stolen away, and the sea-born son left in his place. Why? No one truly knows, only the woman hidden in the sea, and the king. And perhaps the king does not even know. Why? Why is the wind, why is the sea, why is a long road between the world and me. I believe I have said enough about the plot for now. I would like to add, as usual, that one of the reasons I love McKillip stories is the treatment of magic in her imagined worlds. Like Guy Gavriel Kay, she considers magic not as a mechanical, learn spells by the rote and cast them whenever you need them, sort of Force. Magical is a secret and wild thing, elusive and unpredictable, a talent that requires an open mind and a lot of patience to develop. Kyo, the young magician hired by the villagers to recover the huge gold chain holding down the dragon, explains to Peri how he experiences magic: Slowly you learn to turn the dark into shapes, colors ... It's like a second dawn breaking over the world. You see something most people can't see and yet it seems clear as the nose on your face. That there's nothing in the world that doesn't possess its share of magic. Even an empty shell, a lump of lead, an old dead leaf - you look at them and learn to see, and then to use, and after a while you can't remember ever seeing the world any other way. Everything connects to something else. In the current novel, this majesty, mystery and danger of magic is symbolized by the sea, a fickle mistress that can in the blink of an eye turn from coy to murderous. Lyo, with his magical eye, can unveil the poetry of the sea in a way that the gold crazed locals have long forgotten in their daily drudge of earning a living. He seemed delighted by the sea life, as if he had seen little of it, yet he rowed fearlessly farther than Peri had ever gone, out to where the very surface of the world was fluid and dangerous, where the sea was the ruling kingdom they trespassed upon in their tiny, fragile boats, and the life and beauty in it lay far beneath them, in places forbidden to their eyes. The Changeling Sea is one of the novels I would love to see turned into a movie (especially after watching the horrible example of what passes for rom-com today with \"Trainwreck\"). It may not be action filled or grimdark or even epic, but it has style and charm enough to put me in a good mood, more inclined to see the wonder of the world around me instead of its dinginess. It's an odd thing, happiness. Some people take happiness from gold. Or black pearls. And some of us, far more fortunate, take their happiness from periwinkles.

I hope I find more authors like this while achieving my goal! I don't normally like books with romance in them. Especially romance books that are also Young Adult. This book was way out of my comfort zone being shelved under both. But the writing was so well done and the tale so beautiful that I enjoyed this one immensely. Everyone who tells the tale of a sea- journey, or listens to it, travels there safely and comes back again. The story is about a girl named Periwinkle who has lost both her parents to the sea - her father who disappeared while fishing and her mother who stares at the sea all day mourning his loss. Using spells taught to her by an old lady before she too mysteriously disappears, Peri hexes the sea. \"I hex you. I hate you, I curse you, I lay a hex on you, Sea so that all your spellbindings will unravel, and all your magic is confused, and so that you never again take anything or anyone who belongs to us, and you let go of whatever you have.\" And thus begins a whirlwind story of two princes, a King, a magician, love and the land under the sea. I highly recommend this book, and I am looking forward to exploring this author's other works."

A Menina do Mar comes to mind, and though it's a children's book it's absolutely perfect, perhaps because I read it when I was a little girl and those books always have a special place in our hearts. The Changeling Sea through what I can only assume to be some freaky magical powers Patricia McKillip possesses, managed to be placed into that same corner of my heart even though I've read it as an adult.

There's something delightful and magical about the way she writes that pulls me into her stories, and I don't surface until the last page is turned. It doesn't happen often to me, but once in awhile I come across a book and wish I was young again to enjoy it with an open, less burdened mind, and to enjoy it in the spirit it was written and, just for a moment, be its target audience again. This is one of those rare books in which the magic is real; I just can't feel it anymore. Even though I enjoy it now and really like the writing, it's a cold, intellectual kind of enjoyment. Lovely prose, lovely story. I love the way it reads on the page and can methodically deconstruct all the things that I like about it and appreciate the parts as much as the whole story, but it doesn't hit me right in the feels like The Forgotten Beasts of Eld . Yet I'm certain I would have loved this book more when I was younger, when I would have been eager to be fully immersed in the mystique of the sea and its mysterious magical pull. I think, back then, I would have been able to hear it calling as clearly as Peri. \"Be happy now,\" she whispered, aware of all the shining waves behind him reaching toward him, withdrawing, beckoning again. She added, feeling the pain again in her throat, \"When I'm old--older than the old women who taught me to make the hexes--come for me then.\" \"I will.\" \"Promise me. That you will bring me black pearls and sing me into the sea when I am old.\" \"I promise.\" [...] \"Your heart sang to the sea. I heard it, deep in my coral tower, and followed the singing. Humans say the sea sings to them and traps them, but sometimes it is the human song that traps the sea. Who knows where the land ends and the sea begins?\" \"The land begins where time begins.\" [...] \"It's an odd thing, happiness. Some people take happiness from gold. Or black pearls.

I didn't like the other book by this author I've read nearly as much -- perhaps not at all, I can't remember. But this is lovely. It's a story about longing, really, longing and love. It spellbound me, and managed to capture something I love about the sea: its beauty, humans' fascination with it, its danger... Dar Williams' The Ocean comes to mind here, somewhat. It's not really a story tied together by plot, but by emotion, and Kir's longing, Peri's love and hope, the king's sadness, it all got to me. The book is short, but I'll be thinking about it for a while. Another comparison that comes to mind is Susan Cooper's Seaward."

A lowly scullery maid, who's fisher father died at sea and who's mother is psychologically lost to the sea, hates the ocean and tries to put a hex on it but ends up becoming embroiled in powerful magic and the King's family who's one time tryst with the sea queen is coming back to haunt him. Those who have read McKillip before will find the evocative prose and the opaque dialogue, in which the characters seem to talk around each other, quite familiar. Once again the emphasis is not on action but rather the emotional conflict and tension. Not quite up to the standard of The Forgotten Beasts of Eld but a very good book nonetheless."

        "text":"This is a lovely little story. There’s something of the fairytale about it, the ordinary young woman caught up in a story of kings and magic and sea-people, especially when delivered in McKillip’s polished, timeless prose. But there’s also an essential groundedness to her writing, particularly here, that makes it all feel real: the sensory details of life at the edge of the sea, the practicalities of cleaning. I loved the sheer ordinariness of our heroine, Peri, a 15-year-old girl from a small fishing village. Her father was recently lost at sea and her mother sunk into depression; Peri has responded by moving into an abandoned house, and rarely interacts with others except as required by her job scrubbing floors at the local inn. Most fantasy protagonists are portrayed as better than those around them, whether through lineage or abilities or personality or some combination, which is a rather toxic worldview if imbibed too often and uncritically. Peri is decidedly not, though some unusual things happen to her and she does discover her magical talent (which is not the story’s focus). She’s believable as a poor villager: she doesn’t have a big dreams, she doesn’t read for enjoyment, she works for a living and is often seen doing so. Her firmer and more articulate coworker, Mare, seems perhaps the more natural heroine. But in the context of this story, Peri’s baffled acceptance of whatever comes works well; she’s endearing and easy to sympathize with. The supporting characters meanwhile are deftly drawn and engaging, and their dialogue brings them to life despite the book’s short length. Though at 137 pages this is a very short novel, it feels complete, and probably double the length of recent novelettes that are stretched through various formatting tricks to reach that same page count. It also has that ageless quality of books written from before YA was an established genre with its own expectations and tropes. Peri is 15, but I think this could be enjoyed at any age and isn’t written specifically to teen concerns. Indeed, Peri ultimately moves back in with her mom, rather than out as one might expect in a teen novel! Notably for me, this is my fifth McKillip, and her writing hasn’t gone sour for me yet! The climax and ending here make perfect sense, unlike some of her others, although I wasn’t thrilled with the idea of Peri’s getting romantically involved with Lyo; the age and experience gap feels very large. I’d rank those of her books I’ve read as follows: 1) The Forgotten Beasts of Eld 2) The Changeling Sea 3 & 4) Ombria in Shadow and Alphabet of Thorn 5) The Bards of Bone Plain (the only dud so far) While I don’t expect this book to stick with me, it’s beautiful and bittersweet and expertly written, and I didn’t want it to end. A little gem of a story."

Her writing has such luscious descriptions you just want to gather them all up and devour them like precious edible gold. It’s just amazing how she manages to spill her wonderful imagination out into the pages and spin a story with the skills to back it up. Sure this novel (a novella almost, really) is short but I really loved how she takes a familiar aspect in fairy lore (the switching of babies) and places it in an entirely different setting. Her transformation of it is fabulous and I thought worked really well with the sea backdrop. The characters may not be so deeply explored but we see them shine on the pages that they are on. The ending of this book was very quiet compared to the mysterious and overwhelming sense of mystery and pull we had at the beginning, which I think made for a nice contrast. It’s almost bittersweet but we are left with such pleased emotions after. I know everyone has said this already but this tale is exactly that: lovely. A lovely, lovely tale with some of the most beautiful writing published."

        "text":"Its my second book by Patricia McKillip after the The Riddle-Master of Hed . I liked that book but I loved this one. It is a short, simple and beautifully written book. It is a story of a girl, two princes, one magician and a sea dragon. After Perriwinkle's father's death, her mother is in a deep depression. Peri has stopped living with her mother and has started living in an old woman's abandoned house near the sea. Though she visits her mother occasionally but her mother rarely acknowledge her presence. With each passing day Peri is getting more and more frustrated. One day when she couldn't bear anymore. She uses a little magic and hexes the sea and curses it. This sets a series of events in motion and Peri finds herself between two princes and their wishes to live in a place they crave for. Peri is a very intriguing character. She is introvert and alone, a girl craving her mother's love and attention. When her father who was a fisher dies in the sea, her mother starts thinking that her father is alive and is in a Kingdom that exist under the sea. That is one of the reason that she wants to unravel the mystery of the sea. She is a brave girl and her courage earns her the trust and respect of the men around her. Its a fairy tale kind of story and McKillip has told this in a wonderful way. Her writing has lyrical feel to it. The story is short yet it has a great character development. All in all its a story of magic, mystery, fear, courage, hope and love."

        "text":"Originally reviewed on The Book Smugglers In a small fishing village on the coast of the wide, stormy sea, a bright-eyed young woman named Periwinkle makes her home. After her father, a fisherman, rows out his ship and never returns, Peri's mother lapses into quiet despair, forgetting to talk and always staring out at the roiling sea and fantasizing about the people that live in its depths. Without her parents to watch over her or remind her to do things like brush her hair or hem her clothes, Peri grows from a quiet child to a wild and somewhat neglected young woman - her hair always a tangle, her dresses bleached of all color, too tight in some places, too loose in others. Even the old wise woman who used to brush Peri's hair in her small cottage disappears one day, leaving Peri without anyone to care for her at all. During the day, she works at the local inn, scrubbing floors and cleaning rooms; by night, she returns to the old woman's cottage and makes her own isolated home where she plots her revenge against the sea. Hateful of the ocean that has taken both of her parents away, Peri crafts three crude hexes to curse the sea - it is here that she meets Prince Kir, who also knew the wise woman and years for her counsel. Kir has deep troubles of his own, also connected to the watery depths, and hopes that Peri can help him make his peace with the ocean that haunts his every waking moment. When Peri finishes her hexes and throws them deep into the great water, she also includes an offering from Kir - and to Peri's great astonishment, her hexes start to work . A great sea dragon starts to appear amongst the fishermen's boats on the sea, with an impossibly large gold chain around its neck. Then, a magician comes to town, promising that he will be able to remove the chain and give the gold to the villagers - for a price. And most importantly, Kir's dreams of the sea grow more fevered and frantic, as his own unknown, hidden past catches up to him. And it is all up to Periwinkle to set everything back to rights. To date, I've only read a handful of books and short stories from Patricia McKillip, mostly her recent releases. The Changeling Sea , however, is one of McKillip's earlier works, originally published in the 1980s and instantly endeared itself to me - a changeling fable that takes place by the stormy sea? What better place to jump into McKillip's rich and extensive backlist? And you know what? I absolutely loved this book. Shortly put: The Changeling Sea is another gorgeous, wonderful book from the incredibly talented McKillip. I'm going to say something that sounds incredibly cheesy, but it is so very true: Patricia McKillip has a way with words that is simply magical. Like The Bell at Sealey Head or The Bards of Bone Plain , The Changeling Sea is a slender book, but one written with lush and evocative prose that is as beautiful as it is simple. For example: A sigh, smelling of shrimp and seaweed, wafted over the water... In the deep waters beyond the stones, a great flaming sea-thing gazed back at her, big as a house or two, its mouth a strainer like the mouth of a baleen whale, its translucent fiery streamers coiling and uncoiling languorously in the warm waters. The brow fins over its wide eyes gave it a surprised expression. Around its neck, like a dog collar, was a massive chain of pure gold. Beautiful, no? Such is McKillip's writing, littered throughout with these gleaming gems of description and story. Love and anger are like land and sea: They meet at many different places. As the title suggests, The Changeling Sea is a fable about a changeling, and a story whose heart is inextricably tied to the sea. It's a book about love - no, scratch that. It's actually a book about yearning for what once was, and what can never be again. It's the book of a King that yearns for the beauty of the sea queen in all her splendor, the story of two brothers crossed at birth that yearn for their true homes on sea and on land. It's the story of a wild haired, barefooted fisherman's daughter that dares hex the spiteful sea, and yearns for the love of one that can never return it. Aren't these some of the best of all? These stories of want and hate and love, all jumbled up into one powerful package of emotion? And then there are the characters! Periwinkle, our heroine, is a pinched and angry character at first, who scowls at the ocean but refuses to leave its shores despite her hate. She's bold and wild, who cares little about the conventions that bind others - she doesn't have secret dreams of catching the prince's eye like the other girls who work at the inn, and she doesn't pay attention to her clothes or her hair. She's smart but rough around the edges, passionate but obstinate - and for all that, a character you cannot help but love, flaws and all. There is the tortured Kir, who is...well, defined by his yearning for the ocean and his feeling that he does not belong on dry land. There's also the sea dragon himself, who is not at all what he seems, and a king that has made mistakes in his past but loves his children and lovers dearly. But for all that, my other favorite character in this beautiful little book is Lyo - the canny magician, with his smiling face and his penchant for twisting magic in delightful, unexpected ways. All in all, I loved The Changeling Sea , and absolutely recommend it. I cannot wait to try more of Patricia McKillip's work - now, any suggestions on where to go next?"

As the story progressed, though, I found that it seemed to lack the depth that I was hoping it would have. It could have been really good, but I found myself unable to connect with any of the characters. I liked that Kir was so desperate to get into the sea, but he was also aloof and unreachable, and I found his relationship with Peri rather forced. What reason did he have to love her, or her him? It seemed to be convenient for the author for them to be in love, but the story didn't back it up, and because of that, any sense of loss that should have come at the end of the story was missing, and I found the end rather unsatisfying, since the whole book pointed to exactly what would happen (but not how) all along, and there weren't any surprises once we got there, except perhaps, for the magician's sudden attraction to Peri."

        "text":"The sea has always fascinated me, mayhap because I was born near one and usually went to sleep lulled by the sound of its waves. It could also be because I have loved its might, which made me feel totally insignificant in the entire realm of things or maybe because I always stood tall before the sea, almost as if I were challenging it to do its worst, while it gently responded to me by lapping at my feet, almost caressing me and soothing away my pain and anger. I will never know the exact reason but I believe that it is a combination of all this and more, which makes the sea a special entity in my life. Are you wondering why I am waxing poetry about the sea? Don’t worry, I have not gone completely nutty, it’s just that this book is set in a place by the sea and deals with both the magic as well as the mysterious nature of the sea. This is my first book by the author and I must take time to point out that she definitely writes a lyrical story, one that is both high on imagination as well as story building. A true page turner that leaves you spellbound at every moment. It was almost as if the author had a magical romantic tryst with herself while writing this book, her love and passion flows through the pages and the story, leaving the reader feeling warm and yet seeking an unknown that is both within reach as well as beyond. The story is about a girl, Peri or Periwinkle, a floor scrubber in an inn, who loses her father to the sea. Her mother, devastated by this loss is almost like a mute sculpture, which adds to the loss felt by Peri. She hates the sea for the loss of her loved ones and with the help of an old woman in the village, she manages to hex the sea. Of course, she doesn’t believe that her hexes will come true and goes about her work as usual. During this period, she meets the Prince Kir, son of the King of that country, who truly yearns for the sea as no one else can. The story moves onto include a magician Lyo, a sea dragon and some wonderful twists and turns, ultimately leading to a wonderful story, which is both romantic and poignant. Where the story starts with a very light and sweet note, it quickly takes its turn to the mysterious and magical. What made me really like this book was the fact that the twists and turns do not seem to be forced or a farce. You move with it, experiencing the pain, angst, love, magic and all other elements that are thrown in together and faced by the characters. Each character is extremely believable and well developed. Whether it is the anguished Prince Kir or the lost sea dragon or the beguiling magician or even Peri, the main heroine, they are all believable and definitely characters that you can relate to. I loved the writing, which as I mentioned earlier is totally magical. I usually don’t have favourite quotes or passages from the books I read or rather don’t usually mention them but there were two in this book that really struck me, which makes me want to share it here to explain just how poetic the writing can be. Of course, I can be accused of liking cheesy writing by some, but honestly to me it was magical. When asked to explain what magic was, the magician Lyo says these words: “Magic is like night, when you first encounter it. A vast black full of shapes… slowly you learn to turn the dark into shapes, colors… it’s like a second dawn is breaking over the world. You see something most people can’t see and yet it seems clear as the nose on your face. That there’s nothing in the world that doesn’t possess its share of magic.” And at a later stage when explaining how he knows when Peri calls him, he tells her this “I listen,” he said obscurely. “If you listen hard enough, you begin to hear things… the sorrow beneath the smile, the voice within the fire dragon, the secret in the young floor-scrubber’s voice, behind all the talk of gold…” Overall this is a simple story that is told beautifully, full of magic that makes you feel as if you are being soothed and rioted by the waves of the sea. So if you are in a mood to relax and enjoy a simple story, with some magic and beautiful presentation, do pick this one up and I can guarantee that you will enjoy it."

        "text":"\"Only the black pearl in her pocket told her that mystery had come into her life and gone, leaving her stranded at the tide's edge, yearning.\" The Changeling Sea was absolutely mesmerising. It was actually one of the earliest books recommended to me here on GoodReads, along with the author Patricia McKillip in general. For some reason, I've always felt rather reluctant to read her books. The summaries, cover arts and reviews of all her works seemed as though they held stories I would love - but for some unexplainable reason, I always felt worried that I wouldn't. If The Changeling Sea is anything to go by, I have absolutely no more fear of venturing into more of McKillip's tales! The Changeling Sea is short - part of me wishes there were more, but then it is perfect as it is. I seem to have fallen in love with the characters just as they fell in love with the sea. I can't quite put my finger on it - despite the short time spent with them, I found myself caring for them deeply and wishing for them all to find their happiness - which at times did not always seem likely. The narration is hauntingly beautiful - there are only a few books (interestingly, all short ones) that I have come across with a similar dream-like and magical atmosphere. It was almost a little melancholic at times but it had enough magic, wonder and a little humour to keep you hopeful. I've only recently finished the book and I already feel like reading it again. I don't even know how else to put it - I just absolutely loved it."

        "text":"It's no secret that Patricia McKillip is a most beloved author for so many fantasy readers. I discovered her late in the game, when I ran across a beautiful reissued omnibus edition of The Riddle-master Trilogy in a Barnes & Noble several years ago. After finishing that excellent trilogy, I went looking for any other McKillip books I could get my hands on. The result was a binge, of sorts, in which I blew through six or seven titles without a by-your-leave. And it was an immensely good time. But it did result in a little bit of fatigue, as her writing style is very specific and lyrical and I wound up needing to cleanse my palate a little after. Since then I've re-read a few of my favorites here and there, particularly the Riddle-Master and The Book of Atrix Wolfe , but not since The Tower at Stony Wood 's release have I picked up one of her new ones. While I was perusing the McKillip section on my shelves the other night, the slender little volume THE CHANGELING SEA caught my eye and I got to thinking it might be time to get back on the McKillip wagon. Originally published in 1988, this young adult fantasy has stood the test of time. Firebird put out the pretty little edition pictured on the right in 2003 and, having worked hard to find my own used copy, I was happy to see new life breathed into it. I also think it's the most accurate artistic representation of Peri herself and the spiraling, mesmerizing tone of the novel. Nobody ever really noticed Periwinkle. She and her small family have always been a bit on their own, quietly living out their lives in their sleepy fishing village. And then the year she turns fifteen, Peri is suddenly really and truly alone for the first time in her young life. It seems the sea has taken everything that she loves. First her father who drowned and now her mother who failed to get over her father's death to the point where she no longer talks to Peri at all. And so Peri spends her days working as a chamber maid, scrubbing floors at the local inn, and her nights trying desperately to curse the sea that's been the source of all her sorrow. Magic has always been a part of Peri's world, though it's never made itself known with quite such a presence as it does the day the King arrives in town with his son Prince Kir. The unhappy prince has a problem that plagues him, a problem he hopes Peri may be able to help him with. If she will just include something of his in her latest curse, perhaps the longing that rides him will abate. Neither of them expect the sea monster who rises as a result. A sea monster bound by a golden chain and from that point on, nothing is the same in Peri's life, and it is with gratitude she accepts the help of the wizard Lyo--a sort of local wise man. Between the four of them--the girl, the prince, the wizard, and the dragon--they piece together the mystery of what happened in that same place so many years ago and why it's rearing its ugly head now. I loved Peri instantly and without reserve. From the very first page, she is not your classic fairy tale heroine. The opening lines: No one really knew where Peri lived the year after the sea took her father and cast his boat, shrouded in a tangle of fishing net, like an empty shell back onto the beach. She came home when she chose to, sat at her mother's hearth without talking, brooding sullenly at the small, quiet house with the glass floats her father had found, colored bubbles of light, still lying on the dusty windowsill, and the same crazy quilt he had slept under still on the bed, and the door open on quiet evenings to the same view of the village and the harbor with the fishing boats homing in on the incoming tide. Sometimes her mother would rouse herself and cook; sometimes Peri would eat, sometimes she wouldn't. She hated the vague, lost expression on her mother's face, her weary movements. Her hair had begun to gray; she never smiled, she never sang. The sea, it seemed to Peri, had taken her mother as well as her father, and left some stranger wandering despairingly among her cooking pots. She is not beautiful or poised or charming or sweet. But she is kind and determined and involved in unraveling the mystery from beginning to end. She earns the trust of the men around her before (if) she earns their love and we (and they) are frequently reminded of her flaws, from scraped knees to a nose on the large side. Urchin from top to bottom, it is most definitely what's inside that matters with this girl. And it matters quite a lot as so many come to depend on her, including the unusual and wondrous creature from the sea who is himself not exactly what he seems. As is always the case with a McKillip tale, the poetic language and gracefully interwoven magic lend a golden glow to the whole. At the same time, this is one of her more \"real\" stories. Peri is so real. Cloaked in the unreal and unbelievable elements around her, she remains focused and bright. Clocking in at a scant 144 pages, it is also a prime (and all-too- rare) example of a book I don't wish longer. It's perfect just as it is, especially the ending. The briefness only accentuates the sweetness and strangeness and I never fail to finish it at ease with my world and hers."

The half-human\/half-otherwordly love triangle reminds me more than a little of Robin McKinley's Hero and the Crown , particularly in the way the afterlife is evoked to allow for a layered resolution; the debonair young wizard character has a whiff of Diana Wynne Jones's Howl about him, and the rustically witchy protagonist a whiff of Jones's Sophie, with her talent for \"talking life into things\"; the heart-tugging minor chords of the story's emotional palette, revolving around the inexorable power of the sea to take and keep what it pleases, put me in mind of John Allison's The Case of the Fire Inside , among other great selkie stories. This is a book with something to say about bereavement, mourning, and closure, and also about literature\/storytelling\/writing, which seems to be the true subject of this passage that is nominally about magic: He smiled, his eyes, facing the sun, full of light. “Magic is like night, when you first encounter it.” “Night?” she said doubtfully. She skipped a beat with one oar and the Sea Urchin spun a half-circle. “A vast black full of shapes . . .” He trailed his fingers overboard and the Sea Urchin turned its bow toward the horizon again. “Slowly you learn to turn the dark into shapes, colors. . . . It’s like a second dawn breaking over the world. You see something most people can’t see and yet it seems clear as the nose on your face. That there’s nothing in the world that doesn’t possess its share of magic. Even an empty shell, a lump of lead, an old dead leaf—you look at them and learn to see, and then to use, and after a while you can’t remember ever seeing the world any other way. Everything connects to something else....” This was my third McKillip novel after Winter Rose , which was very formative for me, and The Book of Atrix Wolfe , which I honestly don't remember at all. I would rank it somewhere between the two -- quite satisfying."

What's more, her imagination reads like a fairy tale--vivid descriptions, half folk-lore, half reality itself. Yet, the romance is key in The Changeling Sea --key to feeling that bittersweet ache at the close of the novel. And, as you may be able to imagine, I felt very little. With older fantasy tales, a love story usually consists of a form of insta-love: one or two friendly interactions before BAM! true love hits. McKillip's brand of fantasy romance just didn't work for me. I suspect, much like Robin McKinley, here lies another wonderful author whose works will simply continue to elude me."

It's the perfect introduction for anyone new to McKillip's work: it's short but absolutely amazing, it's in print, and it's inexpensive! \"The old woman had made her living weaving. When Peri was younger, she would come to sit at the woman's side and watch the shuttle dart in and out of the loom. The old woman told stories then, strange, wonderful tales of a land beneath the sea where houses were built of pearls, and a constant, powdery shower of gold fell like light through the deep water from the sunken wrecks of mortals' ships.\" (3) \" Come out of the sea and into my heart My dark, my shining love. Promise we shall never part, My dark, my singing love...\" (italics and ellipsis original, 6) This slim little book - a mere 137 pages! - is a masterwork of storytelling. For years, I'd mistakenly thought that this was a children's story, but it's perfect for any age and I'm so glad I finally bought a copy! I'm a huge McKillip fan, and I collect her work. Unfortunately, so much of it is out of print these days. Periwinkle, whimsically named for the way she'd pluck winkles from her father's drying fishing nets as a child, is grieving. Her father has been lost at sea, and her mother's heart and mind have followed him. Peri is 15, and works as a maid at the local inn. Left to her own devices, she dwells mostly in the shack by the sea owned by the local wise woman, who fancied herself a witch. She was like a second mother to Peri, and she too has recently disappeared, yet another loss. Peri is incredibly angry at the sea, and in her hurt, she crafts willow hexes and throws them into the waves. Little does she know that the curses she learned from the wise woman are far more powerful than she ever could have imagined! They bring a gold-chained sea dragon and the King's dark, handsomely brooding son to her door, along with an old mystery. The townsfolk forget their fear of the dragon, dazzled by greed for its chain and the freedom that much gold would bring. They constantly speculate on the best way to take the chain, and the rumour of their desire reaches a young magician, Lyo, who is very good at listening and senses a deeper story in the captivity of the sea dragon. Together, Peri and Lyo unravel the secrets of the kingdom, and of the land beneath the sea. For anyone who loves the ocean as I do, this is a treat! You can almost smell the salt sea air and hear the waves break on the shore. A truly touching story to treasure, of love, loss and letting go."

This is the book that made me fall in love with reading, the very first one I bought with my own savings, more than 10 years ago. It took me half an afternoon to finish it and, once I was done, I immediately went and reread it, skipping homework and totally forgetting about the world outside. I've read it so many times through the years, the pages eventually started to fall off. I remember I found it magical and beautiful, simple and yet complex and intense in its semplicity. It gave me such strong feelings, made my mind and heart travel to places I never thought existed. I often reread it, every now and then, and every time it's like the first time. No matter how great or famous or brilliant or heartbreaking a book is, it will never be as important to me as this one is. I still cherish it and forever will, too. Because it's my most precious treasure and it taught me how to dream."

        "text":"\"What have you done?\" she asked herself aloud. \"What have you done?\" She answered herself a few moments later. \"I've gone and fallen in love with the sea.\" Flawless! Patricia McKillip should give lessons in how to write fantasy romance - imaginative, charming, balancing a tear with a smile, loneliness with selflessness, poetry with the prose of day to day living. She is one of the most consistent writers of modern fairytales I have come across, her lyrical style immediately identifiable, yet bringing something fresh and original with each new book she writes. She infuses even the darker stories with beauty and a sense of wonder, and she turns a deft hand at light comedy when the situation requires it. She felt as if she had stepped into some dream where anything might happen: Her head might float away and turn into the moon; starfish might walk upright onto the sand and dance a courtly dance. Peri, as in Periwinkle, is a young girl who lives in a small village by the sea. When she loses her father in a violent storm, she puts a curse on the cruel sea, throwing into the waves some of her amateurish magical wreaths. Who would believe that a simple scullion girl in the local inn might have the power to awaken terrible forces from their deep blue slumber? Yet soon enough, a magical dragon starts to haunt the sea near the village, a magnificent multicolored beast that is chained to the bottom of the sea by a heavy gold chain. A young man, the obligatory \"tall, dark stranger\", is also haunting the beaches, always looking out to the sea. Pretty soon, another young man will mirror the first one by gazing longingly from the beach towards dry lands. Both of the boys find refuge in the humble hovel of the girl Peri. And spring is coming to the world, awakening in the three young hearts the thoughts of romance. The air was warm, silken, promising longer, lazy days, more light, promising all the soft, mysterious smells and colors of spring after the harsh gray winter. The sand itself was streaked with colors from the sunset. Love triangles have been done to the death in the genre, so expect McKillip to not be satisfied with this classical set-up, and to make Peri a girl with her head screwed the right way onto her shoulders, not too easily swayed by the Heathcliff vibe of tragic destiny in the young bucks coming to her door. Read on, and you might find the resolution of romance to be a logical, if unconventional one. There's a third young man, a young wizard named Lyo, who waits quietly in the background for Peri to realize there's somebody who is not a prince or a tragic hero, yet wants to spend his whole life by her side. The plot is inspired by the old Celtic legends of the Changeling, by the magical realm of the faeries existing hidden beside our own reality, and by the dangers of crossing this invisible barrier between the real and the magical realms. There's a legend like this in the kingdom where Peri lives, a mystery that she unwittingly steps into and must now help to unravel. Once upon a time there was a king who had two sons: one by the young queen, his wife, and one by a woman out of the sea. The sons were born at the same time, and when the queen died in child-bed, her human son was stolen away, and the sea-born son left in his place. Why? No one truly knows, only the woman hidden in the sea, and the king. And perhaps the king does not even know. Why? Why is the wind, why is the sea, why is a long road between the world and me. I believe I have said enough about the plot for now. I would like to add, as usual, that one of the reasons I love McKillip stories is the treatment of magic in her imagined worlds. Like Guy Gavriel Kay, she considers magic not as a mechanical, learn spells by the rote and cast them whenever you need them, sort of Force. Magical is a secret and wild thing, elusive and unpredictable, a talent that requires an open mind and a lot of patience to develop. Kyo, the young magician hired by the villagers to recover the huge gold chain holding down the dragon, explains to Peri how he experiences magic: Slowly you learn to turn the dark into shapes, colors ... It's like a second dawn breaking over the world. You see something most people can't see and yet it seems clear as the nose on your face. That there's nothing in the world that doesn't possess its share of magic. Even an empty shell, a lump of lead, an old dead leaf - you look at them and learn to see, and then to use, and after a while you can't remember ever seeing the world any other way. Everything connects to something else. In the current novel, this majesty, mystery and danger of magic is symbolized by the sea, a fickle mistress that can in the blink of an eye turn from coy to murderous. Lyo, with his magical eye, can unveil the poetry of the sea in a way that the gold crazed locals have long forgotten in their daily drudge of earning a living. He seemed delighted by the sea life, as if he had seen little of it, yet he rowed fearlessly farther than Peri had ever gone, out to where the very surface of the world was fluid and dangerous, where the sea was the ruling kingdom they trespassed upon in their tiny, fragile boats, and the life and beauty in it lay far beneath them, in places forbidden to their eyes. The Changeling Sea is one of the novels I would love to see turned into a movie (especially after watching the horrible example of what passes for rom-com today with \"Trainwreck\"). It may not be action filled or grimdark or even epic, but it has style and charm enough to put me in a good mood, more inclined to see the wonder of the world around me instead of its dinginess. It's an odd thing, happiness. Some people take happiness from gold. Or black pearls. And some of us, far more fortunate, take their happiness from periwinkles.

I hope I find more authors like this while achieving my goal! I don't normally like books with romance in them. Especially romance books that are also Young Adult. This book was way out of my comfort zone being shelved under both. But the writing was so well done and the tale so beautiful that I enjoyed this one immensely. Everyone who tells the tale of a sea- journey, or listens to it, travels there safely and comes back again. The story is about a girl named Periwinkle who has lost both her parents to the sea - her father who disappeared while fishing and her mother who stares at the sea all day mourning his loss. Using spells taught to her by an old lady before she too mysteriously disappears, Peri hexes the sea. \"I hex you. I hate you, I curse you, I lay a hex on you, Sea so that all your spellbindings will unravel, and all your magic is confused, and so that you never again take anything or anyone who belongs to us, and you let go of whatever you have.\" And thus begins a whirlwind story of two princes, a King, a magician, love and the land under the sea. I highly recommend this book, and I am looking forward to exploring this author's other works."

A Menina do Mar comes to mind, and though it's a children's book it's absolutely perfect, perhaps because I read it when I was a little girl and those books always have a special place in our hearts. The Changeling Sea through what I can only assume to be some freaky magical powers Patricia McKillip possesses, managed to be placed into that same corner of my heart even though I've read it as an adult.

        "text":"Another winning tale by Patricia McKillip. This is only the second book I've read by her, but I'm convinced she can do no wrong. There's something delightful and magical about the way she writes that pulls me into her stories, and I don't surface until the last page is turned. It doesn't happen often to me, but once in awhile I come across a book and wish I was young again to enjoy it with an open, less burdened mind, and to enjoy it in the spirit it was written and, just for a moment, be its target audience again. This is one of those rare books in which the magic is real; I just can't feel it anymore. Even though I enjoy it now and really like the writing, it's a cold, intellectual kind of enjoyment. Lovely prose, lovely story. I love the way it reads on the page and can methodically deconstruct all the things that I like about it and appreciate the parts as much as the whole story, but it doesn't hit me right in the feels like The Forgotten Beasts of Eld . Yet I'm certain I would have loved this book more when I was younger, when I would have been eager to be fully immersed in the mystique of the sea and its mysterious magical pull. I think, back then, I would have been able to hear it calling as clearly as Peri. \"Be happy now,\" she whispered, aware of all the shining waves behind him reaching toward him, withdrawing, beckoning again. She added, feeling the pain again in her throat, \"When I'm old--older than the old women who taught me to make the hexes--come for me then.\" \"I will.\" \"Promise me. That you will bring me black pearls and sing me into the sea when I am old.\" \"I promise.\" [...] \"Your heart sang to the sea. I heard it, deep in my coral tower, and followed the singing. Humans say the sea sings to them and traps them, but sometimes it is the human song that traps the sea. Who knows where the land ends and the sea begins?\" \"The land begins where time begins.\" [...] \"It's an odd thing, happiness. Some people take happiness from gold. Or black pearls.

I didn't like the other book by this author I've read nearly as much -- perhaps not at all, I can't remember. But this is lovely. It's a story about longing, really, longing and love. It spellbound me, and managed to capture something I love about the sea: its beauty, humans' fascination with it, its danger... Dar Williams' The Ocean comes to mind here, somewhat. It's not really a story tied together by plot, but by emotion, and Kir's longing, Peri's love and hope, the king's sadness, it all got to me. The book is short, but I'll be thinking about it for a while. Another comparison that comes to mind is Susan Cooper's Seaward."

A lowly scullery maid, who's fisher father died at sea and who's mother is psychologically lost to the sea, hates the ocean and tries to put a hex on it but ends up becoming embroiled in powerful magic and the King's family who's one time tryst with the sea queen is coming back to haunt him. Those who have read McKillip before will find the evocative prose and the opaque dialogue, in which the characters seem to talk around each other, quite familiar. Once again the emphasis is not on action but rather the emotional conflict and tension. Not quite up to the standard of The Forgotten Beasts of Eld but a very good book nonetheless."

        "text":"This is a lovely little story. There’s something of the fairytale about it, the ordinary young woman caught up in a story of kings and magic and sea-people, especially when delivered in McKillip’s polished, timeless prose. But there’s also an essential groundedness to her writing, particularly here, that makes it all feel real: the sensory details of life at the edge of the sea, the practicalities of cleaning. I loved the sheer ordinariness of our heroine, Peri, a 15-year-old girl from a small fishing village. Her father was recently lost at sea and her mother sunk into depression; Peri has responded by moving into an abandoned house, and rarely interacts with others except as required by her job scrubbing floors at the local inn. Most fantasy protagonists are portrayed as better than those around them, whether through lineage or abilities or personality or some combination, which is a rather toxic worldview if imbibed too often and uncritically. Peri is decidedly not, though some unusual things happen to her and she does discover her magical talent (which is not the story’s focus). She’s believable as a poor villager: she doesn’t have a big dreams, she doesn’t read for enjoyment, she works for a living and is often seen doing so. Her firmer and more articulate coworker, Mare, seems perhaps the more natural heroine. But in the context of this story, Peri’s baffled acceptance of whatever comes works well; she’s endearing and easy to sympathize with. The supporting characters meanwhile are deftly drawn and engaging, and their dialogue brings them to life despite the book’s short length. Though at 137 pages this is a very short novel, it feels complete, and probably double the length of recent novelettes that are stretched through various formatting tricks to reach that same page count. It also has that ageless quality of books written from before YA was an established genre with its own expectations and tropes. Peri is 15, but I think this could be enjoyed at any age and isn’t written specifically to teen concerns. Indeed, Peri ultimately moves back in with her mom, rather than out as one might expect in a teen novel! Notably for me, this is my fifth McKillip, and her writing hasn’t gone sour for me yet! The climax and ending here make perfect sense, unlike some of her others, although I wasn’t thrilled with the idea of Peri’s getting romantically involved with Lyo; the age and experience gap feels very large. I’d rank those of her books I’ve read as follows: 1) The Forgotten Beasts of Eld 2) The Changeling Sea 3 & 4) Ombria in Shadow and Alphabet of Thorn 5) The Bards of Bone Plain (the only dud so far) While I don’t expect this book to stick with me, it’s beautiful and bittersweet and expertly written, and I didn’t want it to end. A little gem of a story."

Her writing has such luscious descriptions you just want to gather them all up and devour them like precious edible gold. It’s just amazing how she manages to spill her wonderful imagination out into the pages and spin a story with the skills to back it up. Sure this novel (a novella almost, really) is short but I really loved how she takes a familiar aspect in fairy lore (the switching of babies) and places it in an entirely different setting. Her transformation of it is fabulous and I thought worked really well with the sea backdrop. The characters may not be so deeply explored but we see them shine on the pages that they are on. The ending of this book was very quiet compared to the mysterious and overwhelming sense of mystery and pull we had at the beginning, which I think made for a nice contrast. It’s almost bittersweet but we are left with such pleased emotions after. I know everyone has said this already but this tale is exactly that: lovely. A lovely, lovely tale with some of the most beautiful writing published."

        "text":"Its my second book by Patricia McKillip after the The Riddle-Master of Hed . I liked that book but I loved this one. It is a short, simple and beautifully written book. It is a story of a girl, two princes, one magician and a sea dragon. After Perriwinkle's father's death, her mother is in a deep depression. Peri has stopped living with her mother and has started living in an old woman's abandoned house near the sea. Though she visits her mother occasionally but her mother rarely acknowledge her presence. With each passing day Peri is getting more and more frustrated. One day when she couldn't bear anymore. She uses a little magic and hexes the sea and curses it. This sets a series of events in motion and Peri finds herself between two princes and their wishes to live in a place they crave for. Peri is a very intriguing character. She is introvert and alone, a girl craving her mother's love and attention. When her father who was a fisher dies in the sea, her mother starts thinking that her father is alive and is in a Kingdom that exist under the sea. That is one of the reason that she wants to unravel the mystery of the sea. She is a brave girl and her courage earns her the trust and respect of the men around her. Its a fairy tale kind of story and McKillip has told this in a wonderful way. Her writing has lyrical feel to it. The story is short yet it has a great character development. All in all its a story of magic, mystery, fear, courage, hope and love."

        "text":"Originally reviewed on The Book Smugglers In a small fishing village on the coast of the wide, stormy sea, a bright-eyed young woman named Periwinkle makes her home. After her father, a fisherman, rows out his ship and never returns, Peri's mother lapses into quiet despair, forgetting to talk and always staring out at the roiling sea and fantasizing about the people that live in its depths. Without her parents to watch over her or remind her to do things like brush her hair or hem her clothes, Peri grows from a quiet child to a wild and somewhat neglected young woman - her hair always a tangle, her dresses bleached of all color, too tight in some places, too loose in others. Even the old wise woman who used to brush Peri's hair in her small cottage disappears one day, leaving Peri without anyone to care for her at all. During the day, she works at the local inn, scrubbing floors and cleaning rooms; by night, she returns to the old woman's cottage and makes her own isolated home where she plots her revenge against the sea. Hateful of the ocean that has taken both of her parents away, Peri crafts three crude hexes to curse the sea - it is here that she meets Prince Kir, who also knew the wise woman and years for her counsel. Kir has deep troubles of his own, also connected to the watery depths, and hopes that Peri can help him make his peace with the ocean that haunts his every waking moment. When Peri finishes her hexes and throws them deep into the great water, she also includes an offering from Kir - and to Peri's great astonishment, her hexes start to work . A great sea dragon starts to appear amongst the fishermen's boats on the sea, with an impossibly large gold chain around its neck. Then, a magician comes to town, promising that he will be able to remove the chain and give the gold to the villagers - for a price. And most importantly, Kir's dreams of the sea grow more fevered and frantic, as his own unknown, hidden past catches up to him. And it is all up to Periwinkle to set everything back to rights. To date, I've only read a handful of books and short stories from Patricia McKillip, mostly her recent releases. The Changeling Sea , however, is one of McKillip's earlier works, originally published in the 1980s and instantly endeared itself to me - a changeling fable that takes place by the stormy sea? What better place to jump into McKillip's rich and extensive backlist? And you know what? I absolutely loved this book. Shortly put: The Changeling Sea is another gorgeous, wonderful book from the incredibly talented McKillip. I'm going to say something that sounds incredibly cheesy, but it is so very true: Patricia McKillip has a way with words that is simply magical. Like The Bell at Sealey Head or The Bards of Bone Plain , The Changeling Sea is a slender book, but one written with lush and evocative prose that is as beautiful as it is simple. For example: A sigh, smelling of shrimp and seaweed, wafted over the water... In the deep waters beyond the stones, a great flaming sea-thing gazed back at her, big as a house or two, its mouth a strainer like the mouth of a baleen whale, its translucent fiery streamers coiling and uncoiling languorously in the warm waters. The brow fins over its wide eyes gave it a surprised expression. Around its neck, like a dog collar, was a massive chain of pure gold. Beautiful, no? Such is McKillip's writing, littered throughout with these gleaming gems of description and story. Love and anger are like land and sea: They meet at many different places. As the title suggests, The Changeling Sea is a fable about a changeling, and a story whose heart is inextricably tied to the sea. It's a book about love - no, scratch that. It's actually a book about yearning for what once was, and what can never be again. It's the book of a King that yearns for the beauty of the sea queen in all her splendor, the story of two brothers crossed at birth that yearn for their true homes on sea and on land. It's the story of a wild haired, barefooted fisherman's daughter that dares hex the spiteful sea, and yearns for the love of one that can never return it. Aren't these some of the best of all? These stories of want and hate and love, all jumbled up into one powerful package of emotion? And then there are the characters! Periwinkle, our heroine, is a pinched and angry character at first, who scowls at the ocean but refuses to leave its shores despite her hate. She's bold and wild, who cares little about the conventions that bind others - she doesn't have secret dreams of catching the prince's eye like the other girls who work at the inn, and she doesn't pay attention to her clothes or her hair. She's smart but rough around the edges, passionate but obstinate - and for all that, a character you cannot help but love, flaws and all. There is the tortured Kir, who is...well, defined by his yearning for the ocean and his feeling that he does not belong on dry land. There's also the sea dragon himself, who is not at all what he seems, and a king that has made mistakes in his past but loves his children and lovers dearly. But for all that, my other favorite character in this beautiful little book is Lyo - the canny magician, with his smiling face and his penchant for twisting magic in delightful, unexpected ways. All in all, I loved The Changeling Sea , and absolutely recommend it. I cannot wait to try more of Patricia McKillip's work - now, any suggestions on where to go next?"

As the story progressed, though, I found that it seemed to lack the depth that I was hoping it would have. It could have been really good, but I found myself unable to connect with any of the characters. I liked that Kir was so desperate to get into the sea, but he was also aloof and unreachable, and I found his relationship with Peri rather forced. What reason did he have to love her, or her him? It seemed to be convenient for the author for them to be in love, but the story didn't back it up, and because of that, any sense of loss that should have come at the end of the story was missing, and I found the end rather unsatisfying, since the whole book pointed to exactly what would happen (but not how) all along, and there weren't any surprises once we got there, except perhaps, for the magician's sudden attraction to Peri."

        "text":"The sea has always fascinated me, mayhap because I was born near one and usually went to sleep lulled by the sound of its waves. It could also be because I have loved its might, which made me feel totally insignificant in the entire realm of things or maybe because I always stood tall before the sea, almost as if I were challenging it to do its worst, while it gently responded to me by lapping at my feet, almost caressing me and soothing away my pain and anger. I will never know the exact reason but I believe that it is a combination of all this and more, which makes the sea a special entity in my life. Are you wondering why I am waxing poetry about the sea? Don’t worry, I have not gone completely nutty, it’s just that this book is set in a place by the sea and deals with both the magic as well as the mysterious nature of the sea. This is my first book by the author and I must take time to point out that she definitely writes a lyrical story, one that is both high on imagination as well as story building. A true page turner that leaves you spellbound at every moment. It was almost as if the author had a magical romantic tryst with herself while writing this book, her love and passion flows through the pages and the story, leaving the reader feeling warm and yet seeking an unknown that is both within reach as well as beyond. The story is about a girl, Peri or Periwinkle, a floor scrubber in an inn, who loses her father to the sea. Her mother, devastated by this loss is almost like a mute sculpture, which adds to the loss felt by Peri. She hates the sea for the loss of her loved ones and with the help of an old woman in the village, she manages to hex the sea. Of course, she doesn’t believe that her hexes will come true and goes about her work as usual. During this period, she meets the Prince Kir, son of the King of that country, who truly yearns for the sea as no one else can. The story moves onto include a magician Lyo, a sea dragon and some wonderful twists and turns, ultimately leading to a wonderful story, which is both romantic and poignant. Where the story starts with a very light and sweet note, it quickly takes its turn to the mysterious and magical. What made me really like this book was the fact that the twists and turns do not seem to be forced or a farce. You move with it, experiencing the pain, angst, love, magic and all other elements that are thrown in together and faced by the characters. Each character is extremely believable and well developed. Whether it is the anguished Prince Kir or the lost sea dragon or the beguiling magician or even Peri, the main heroine, they are all believable and definitely characters that you can relate to. I loved the writing, which as I mentioned earlier is totally magical. I usually don’t have favourite quotes or passages from the books I read or rather don’t usually mention them but there were two in this book that really struck me, which makes me want to share it here to explain just how poetic the writing can be. Of course, I can be accused of liking cheesy writing by some, but honestly to me it was magical. When asked to explain what magic was, the magician Lyo says these words: “Magic is like night, when you first encounter it. A vast black full of shapes… slowly you learn to turn the dark into shapes, colors… it’s like a second dawn is breaking over the world. You see something most people can’t see and yet it seems clear as the nose on your face. That there’s nothing in the world that doesn’t possess its share of magic.” And at a later stage when explaining how he knows when Peri calls him, he tells her this “I listen,” he said obscurely. “If you listen hard enough, you begin to hear things… the sorrow beneath the smile, the voice within the fire dragon, the secret in the young floor-scrubber’s voice, behind all the talk of gold…” Overall this is a simple story that is told beautifully, full of magic that makes you feel as if you are being soothed and rioted by the waves of the sea. So if you are in a mood to relax and enjoy a simple story, with some magic and beautiful presentation, do pick this one up and I can guarantee that you will enjoy it."

        "text":"\"Only the black pearl in her pocket told her that mystery had come into her life and gone, leaving her stranded at the tide's edge, yearning.\" The Changeling Sea was absolutely mesmerising. It was actually one of the earliest books recommended to me here on GoodReads, along with the author Patricia McKillip in general. For some reason, I've always felt rather reluctant to read her books. The summaries, cover arts and reviews of all her works seemed as though they held stories I would love - but for some unexplainable reason, I always felt worried that I wouldn't. If The Changeling Sea is anything to go by, I have absolutely no more fear of venturing into more of McKillip's tales! The Changeling Sea is short - part of me wishes there were more, but then it is perfect as it is. I seem to have fallen in love with the characters just as they fell in love with the sea. I can't quite put my finger on it - despite the short time spent with them, I found myself caring for them deeply and wishing for them all to find their happiness - which at times did not always seem likely. The narration is hauntingly beautiful - there are only a few books (interestingly, all short ones) that I have come across with a similar dream-like and magical atmosphere. It was almost a little melancholic at times but it had enough magic, wonder and a little humour to keep you hopeful. I've only recently finished the book and I already feel like reading it again. I don't even know how else to put it - I just absolutely loved it."

        "text":"It's no secret that Patricia McKillip is a most beloved author for so many fantasy readers. I discovered her late in the game, when I ran across a beautiful reissued omnibus edition of The Riddle-master Trilogy in a Barnes & Noble several years ago. After finishing that excellent trilogy, I went looking for any other McKillip books I could get my hands on. The result was a binge, of sorts, in which I blew through six or seven titles without a by-your-leave. And it was an immensely good time. But it did result in a little bit of fatigue, as her writing style is very specific and lyrical and I wound up needing to cleanse my palate a little after. Since then I've re-read a few of my favorites here and there, particularly the Riddle-Master and The Book of Atrix Wolfe , but not since The Tower at Stony Wood 's release have I picked up one of her new ones. While I was perusing the McKillip section on my shelves the other night, the slender little volume THE CHANGELING SEA caught my eye and I got to thinking it might be time to get back on the McKillip wagon. Originally published in 1988, this young adult fantasy has stood the test of time. Firebird put out the pretty little edition pictured on the right in 2003 and, having worked hard to find my own used copy, I was happy to see new life breathed into it. I also think it's the most accurate artistic representation of Peri herself and the spiraling, mesmerizing tone of the novel. Nobody ever really noticed Periwinkle. She and her small family have always been a bit on their own, quietly living out their lives in their sleepy fishing village. And then the year she turns fifteen, Peri is suddenly really and truly alone for the first time in her young life. It seems the sea has taken everything that she loves. First her father who drowned and now her mother who failed to get over her father's death to the point where she no longer talks to Peri at all. And so Peri spends her days working as a chamber maid, scrubbing floors at the local inn, and her nights trying desperately to curse the sea that's been the source of all her sorrow. Magic has always been a part of Peri's world, though it's never made itself known with quite such a presence as it does the day the King arrives in town with his son Prince Kir. The unhappy prince has a problem that plagues him, a problem he hopes Peri may be able to help him with. If she will just include something of his in her latest curse, perhaps the longing that rides him will abate. Neither of them expect the sea monster who rises as a result. A sea monster bound by a golden chain and from that point on, nothing is the same in Peri's life, and it is with gratitude she accepts the help of the wizard Lyo--a sort of local wise man. Between the four of them--the girl, the prince, the wizard, and the dragon--they piece together the mystery of what happened in that same place so many years ago and why it's rearing its ugly head now. I loved Peri instantly and without reserve. From the very first page, she is not your classic fairy tale heroine. The opening lines: No one really knew where Peri lived the year after the sea took her father and cast his boat, shrouded in a tangle of fishing net, like an empty shell back onto the beach. She came home when she chose to, sat at her mother's hearth without talking, brooding sullenly at the small, quiet house with the glass floats her father had found, colored bubbles of light, still lying on the dusty windowsill, and the same crazy quilt he had slept under still on the bed, and the door open on quiet evenings to the same view of the village and the harbor with the fishing boats homing in on the incoming tide. Sometimes her mother would rouse herself and cook; sometimes Peri would eat, sometimes she wouldn't. She hated the vague, lost expression on her mother's face, her weary movements. Her hair had begun to gray; she never smiled, she never sang. The sea, it seemed to Peri, had taken her mother as well as her father, and left some stranger wandering despairingly among her cooking pots. She is not beautiful or poised or charming or sweet. But she is kind and determined and involved in unraveling the mystery from beginning to end. She earns the trust of the men around her before (if) she earns their love and we (and they) are frequently reminded of her flaws, from scraped knees to a nose on the large side. Urchin from top to bottom, it is most definitely what's inside that matters with this girl. And it matters quite a lot as so many come to depend on her, including the unusual and wondrous creature from the sea who is himself not exactly what he seems. As is always the case with a McKillip tale, the poetic language and gracefully interwoven magic lend a golden glow to the whole. At the same time, this is one of her more \"real\" stories. Peri is so real. Cloaked in the unreal and unbelievable elements around her, she remains focused and bright. Clocking in at a scant 144 pages, it is also a prime (and all-too- rare) example of a book I don't wish longer. It's perfect just as it is, especially the ending. The briefness only accentuates the sweetness and strangeness and I never fail to finish it at ease with my world and hers."

        "text":"An emotionally rich, well-plotted sea yarn from a generally excellent fantasy author. The half-human\/half-otherwordly love triangle reminds me more than a little of Robin McKinley's Hero and the Crown , particularly in the way the afterlife is evoked to allow for a layered resolution; the debonair young wizard character has a whiff of Diana Wynne Jones's Howl about him, and the rustically witchy protagonist a whiff of Jones's Sophie, with her talent for \"talking life into things\"; the heart-tugging minor chords of the story's emotional palette, revolving around the inexorable power of the sea to take and keep what it pleases, put me in mind of John Allison's The Case of the Fire Inside , among other great selkie stories. This is a book with something to say about bereavement, mourning, and closure, and also about literature\/storytelling\/writing, which seems to be the true subject of this passage that is nominally about magic: He smiled, his eyes, facing the sun, full of light. “Magic is like night, when you first encounter it.” “Night?” she said doubtfully. She skipped a beat with one oar and the Sea Urchin spun a half-circle. “A vast black full of shapes . . .” He trailed his fingers overboard and the Sea Urchin turned its bow toward the horizon again. “Slowly you learn to turn the dark into shapes, colors. . . . It’s like a second dawn breaking over the world. You see something most people can’t see and yet it seems clear as the nose on your face. That there’s nothing in the world that doesn’t possess its share of magic. Even an empty shell, a lump of lead, an old dead leaf—you look at them and learn to see, and then to use, and after a while you can’t remember ever seeing the world any other way. Everything connects to something else....” This was my third McKillip novel after Winter Rose , which was very formative for me, and The Book of Atrix Wolfe , which I honestly don't remember at all. I would rank it somewhere between the two -- quite satisfying."

What's more, her imagination reads like a fairy tale--vivid descriptions, half folk-lore, half reality itself. Yet, the romance is key in The Changeling Sea --key to feeling that bittersweet ache at the close of the novel. And, as you may be able to imagine, I felt very little. With older fantasy tales, a love story usually consists of a form of insta-love: one or two friendly interactions before BAM! true love hits. McKillip's brand of fantasy romance just didn't work for me. I suspect, much like Robin McKinley, here lies another wonderful author whose works will simply continue to elude me."

It's the perfect introduction for anyone new to McKillip's work: it's short but absolutely amazing, it's in print, and it's inexpensive! \"The old woman had made her living weaving. When Peri was younger, she would come to sit at the woman's side and watch the shuttle dart in and out of the loom. The old woman told stories then, strange, wonderful tales of a land beneath the sea where houses were built of pearls, and a constant, powdery shower of gold fell like light through the deep water from the sunken wrecks of mortals' ships.\" (3) \" Come out of the sea and into my heart My dark, my shining love. Promise we shall never part, My dark, my singing love...\" (italics and ellipsis original, 6) This slim little book - a mere 137 pages! - is a masterwork of storytelling. For years, I'd mistakenly thought that this was a children's story, but it's perfect for any age and I'm so glad I finally bought a copy! I'm a huge McKillip fan, and I collect her work. Unfortunately, so much of it is out of print these days. Periwinkle, whimsically named for the way she'd pluck winkles from her father's drying fishing nets as a child, is grieving. Her father has been lost at sea, and her mother's heart and mind have followed him. Peri is 15, and works as a maid at the local inn. Left to her own devices, she dwells mostly in the shack by the sea owned by the local wise woman, who fancied herself a witch. She was like a second mother to Peri, and she too has recently disappeared, yet another loss. Peri is incredibly angry at the sea, and in her hurt, she crafts willow hexes and throws them into the waves. Little does she know that the curses she learned from the wise woman are far more powerful than she ever could have imagined! They bring a gold-chained sea dragon and the King's dark, handsomely brooding son to her door, along with an old mystery. The townsfolk forget their fear of the dragon, dazzled by greed for its chain and the freedom that much gold would bring. They constantly speculate on the best way to take the chain, and the rumour of their desire reaches a young magician, Lyo, who is very good at listening and senses a deeper story in the captivity of the sea dragon. Together, Peri and Lyo unravel the secrets of the kingdom, and of the land beneath the sea. For anyone who loves the ocean as I do, this is a treat! You can almost smell the salt sea air and hear the waves break on the shore. A truly touching story to treasure, of love, loss and letting go."

        "text":"\"What have you done?\" she asked herself aloud. \"What have you done?\" She answered herself a few moments later. \"I've gone and fallen in love with the sea.\" Flawless! Patricia McKillip should give lessons in how to write fantasy romance - imaginative, charming, balancing a tear with a smile, loneliness with selflessness, poetry with the prose of day to day living. She is one of the most consistent writers of modern fairytales I have come across, her lyrical style immediately identifiable, yet bringing something fresh and original with each new book she writes. She infuses even the darker stories with beauty and a sense of wonder, and she turns a deft hand at light comedy when the situation requires it. She felt as if she had stepped into some dream where anything might happen: Her head might float away and turn into the moon; starfish might walk upright onto the sand and dance a courtly dance. Peri, as in Periwinkle, is a young girl who lives in a small village by the sea. When she loses her father in a violent storm, she puts a curse on the cruel sea, throwing into the waves some of her amateurish magical wreaths. Who would believe that a simple scullion girl in the local inn might have the power to awaken terrible forces from their deep blue slumber? Yet soon enough, a magical dragon starts to haunt the sea near the village, a magnificent multicolored beast that is chained to the bottom of the sea by a heavy gold chain. A young man, the obligatory \"tall, dark stranger\", is also haunting the beaches, always looking out to the sea. Pretty soon, another young man will mirror the first one by gazing longingly from the beach towards dry lands. Both of the boys find refuge in the humble hovel of the girl Peri. And spring is coming to the world, awakening in the three young hearts the thoughts of romance. The air was warm, silken, promising longer, lazy days, more light, promising all the soft, mysterious smells and colors of spring after the harsh gray winter. The sand itself was streaked with colors from the sunset. Love triangles have been done to the death in the genre, so expect McKillip to not be satisfied with this classical set-up, and to make Peri a girl with her head screwed the right way onto her shoulders, not too easily swayed by the Heathcliff vibe of tragic destiny in the young bucks coming to her door. Read on, and you might find the resolution of romance to be a logical, if unconventional one. There's a third young man, a young wizard named Lyo, who waits quietly in the background for Peri to realize there's somebody who is not a prince or a tragic hero, yet wants to spend his whole life by her side. The plot is inspired by the old Celtic legends of the Changeling, by the magical realm of the faeries existing hidden beside our own reality, and by the dangers of crossing this invisible barrier between the real and the magical realms. There's a legend like this in the kingdom where Peri lives, a mystery that she unwittingly steps into and must now help to unravel. Once upon a time there was a king who had two sons: one by the young queen, his wife, and one by a woman out of the sea. The sons were born at the same time, and when the queen died in child-bed, her human son was stolen away, and the sea-born son left in his place. Why? No one truly knows, only the woman hidden in the sea, and the king. And perhaps the king does not even know. Why? Why is the wind, why is the sea, why is a long road between the world and me. I believe I have said enough about the plot for now. I would like to add, as usual, that one of the reasons I love McKillip stories is the treatment of magic in her imagined worlds. Like Guy Gavriel Kay, she considers magic not as a mechanical, learn spells by the rote and cast them whenever you need them, sort of Force. Magical is a secret and wild thing, elusive and unpredictable, a talent that requires an open mind and a lot of patience to develop. Kyo, the young magician hired by the villagers to recover the huge gold chain holding down the dragon, explains to Peri how he experiences magic: Slowly you learn to turn the dark into shapes, colors ... It's like a second dawn breaking over the world. You see something most people can't see and yet it seems clear as the nose on your face. That there's nothing in the world that doesn't possess its share of magic. Even an empty shell, a lump of lead, an old dead leaf - you look at them and learn to see, and then to use, and after a while you can't remember ever seeing the world any other way. Everything connects to something else. In the current novel, this majesty, mystery and danger of magic is symbolized by the sea, a fickle mistress that can in the blink of an eye turn from coy to murderous. Lyo, with his magical eye, can unveil the poetry of the sea in a way that the gold crazed locals have long forgotten in their daily drudge of earning a living. He seemed delighted by the sea life, as if he had seen little of it, yet he rowed fearlessly farther than Peri had ever gone, out to where the very surface of the world was fluid and dangerous, where the sea was the ruling kingdom they trespassed upon in their tiny, fragile boats, and the life and beauty in it lay far beneath them, in places forbidden to their eyes. The Changeling Sea is one of the novels I would love to see turned into a movie (especially after watching the horrible example of what passes for rom-com today with \"Trainwreck\"). It may not be action filled or grimdark or even epic, but it has style and charm enough to put me in a good mood, more inclined to see the wonder of the world around me instead of its dinginess. It's an odd thing, happiness. Some people take happiness from gold. Or black pearls. And some of us, far more fortunate, take their happiness from periwinkles.

I hope I find more authors like this while achieving my goal! I don't normally like books with romance in them. Especially romance books that are also Young Adult. This book was way out of my comfort zone being shelved under both. But the writing was so well done and the tale so beautiful that I enjoyed this one immensely. Everyone who tells the tale of a sea- journey, or listens to it, travels there safely and comes back again. The story is about a girl named Periwinkle who has lost both her parents to the sea - her father who disappeared while fishing and her mother who stares at the sea all day mourning his loss. Using spells taught to her by an old lady before she too mysteriously disappears, Peri hexes the sea. \"I hex you. I hate you, I curse you, I lay a hex on you, Sea so that all your spellbindings will unravel, and all your magic is confused, and so that you never again take anything or anyone who belongs to us, and you let go of whatever you have.\" And thus begins a whirlwind story of two princes, a King, a magician, love and the land under the sea. I highly recommend this book, and I am looking forward to exploring this author's other works."

Sometimes people ask me to recommend a book and it usually goes a bit like this: Hipster girl: Hey do you know which book I shoul-- Me: The Changeling Sea ! ~*~ Metalhead dude: Hey, I've been thinking about readi-- Me: The Changeling Sea ! ~*~ Mum: Any books you-- Me: The Changeling Sea ! ~*~ Some friend: Got any books yo-- Me: The Changeling Sea ! Some friend. You always say that! I've already read it! Me: READ IT AGAIN. Anyone who's lived their whole life by the sea will tell you that it's hard to successfully write a story that will give you the sense of wonder and possibility it brings. A Menina do Mar comes to mind, and though it's a children's book it's absolutely perfect, perhaps because I read it when I was a little girl and those books always have a special place in our hearts. The Changeling Sea through what I can only assume to be some freaky magical powers Patricia McKillip possesses, managed to be placed into that same corner of my heart even though I've read it as an adult. I guess that's the highest praise a book can get."

        "text":"Another winning tale by Patricia McKillip. This is only the second book I've read by her, but I'm convinced she can do no wrong. There's something delightful and magical about the way she writes that pulls me into her stories, and I don't surface until the last page is turned. It doesn't happen often to me, but once in awhile I come across a book and wish I was young again to enjoy it with an open, less burdened mind, and to enjoy it in the spirit it was written and, just for a moment, be its target audience again. This is one of those rare books in which the magic is real; I just can't feel it anymore. Even though I enjoy it now and really like the writing, it's a cold, intellectual kind of enjoyment. Lovely prose, lovely story. I love the way it reads on the page and can methodically deconstruct all the things that I like about it and appreciate the parts as much as the whole story, but it doesn't hit me right in the feels like The Forgotten Beasts of Eld . Yet I'm certain I would have loved this book more when I was younger, when I would have been eager to be fully immersed in the mystique of the sea and its mysterious magical pull. I think, back then, I would have been able to hear it calling as clearly as Peri. \"Be happy now,\" she whispered, aware of all the shining waves behind him reaching toward him, withdrawing, beckoning again. She added, feeling the pain again in her throat, \"When I'm old--older than the old women who taught me to make the hexes--come for me then.\" \"I will.\" \"Promise me. That you will bring me black pearls and sing me into the sea when I am old.\" \"I promise.\" [...] \"Your heart sang to the sea. I heard it, deep in my coral tower, and followed the singing. Humans say the sea sings to them and traps them, but sometimes it is the human song that traps the sea. Who knows where the land ends and the sea begins?\" \"The land begins where time begins.\" [...] \"It's an odd thing, happiness. Some people take happiness from gold. Or black pearls. And some of us, far more fortunate, take their happiness from periwinkles.\" Cross-posted at https:\/\/covers2covers.wordpress.com\/2..."

        "text":"This is a gorgeous, bittersweet, perfect, completely unsatisfying story. It's a fairytale that feels real. All of those things at once? Yes. I didn't like the other book by this author I've read nearly as much -- perhaps not at all, I can't remember. But this is lovely. It's a story about longing, really, longing and love. It spellbound me, and managed to capture something I love about the sea: its beauty, humans' fascination with it, its danger... Dar Williams' The Ocean comes to mind here, somewhat. It's not really a story tied together by plot, but by emotion, and Kir's longing, Peri's love and hope, the king's sadness, it all got to me. The book is short, but I'll be thinking about it for a while. Another comparison that comes to mind is Susan Cooper's Seaward."

It doesn't need three hundred or four hundred pages, much of them filled with boring details to tell its story. It slowly arrives, it tells its tale, it imprints it in our hearts and minds, and calmly goes away... A coming of age punctuated by loss and finding what's important in one's live. \"It’s an odd thing, happiness. Some people take happiness from gold. Or black pearls. And some of us, far more fortunate, take their happiness from periwinkles.”"

        "text":"This short, standalone novel (a novella really) written in McKillip's usual beautiful yet elliptical style is exactly the sort of thing that I come to expect from her work. A lowly scullery maid, who's fisher father died at sea and who's mother is psychologically lost to the sea, hates the ocean and tries to put a hex on it but ends up becoming embroiled in powerful magic and the King's family who's one time tryst with the sea queen is coming back to haunt him. Those who have read McKillip before will find the evocative prose and the opaque dialogue, in which the characters seem to talk around each other, quite familiar. Once again the emphasis is not on action but rather the emotional conflict and tension. Not quite up to the standard of The Forgotten Beasts of Eld but a very good book nonetheless."

        "text":"This is a lovely little story. There’s something of the fairytale about it, the ordinary young woman caught up in a story of kings and magic and sea-people, especially when delivered in McKillip’s polished, timeless prose. But there’s also an essential groundedness to her writing, particularly here, that makes it all feel real: the sensory details of life at the edge of the sea, the practicalities of cleaning. I loved the sheer ordinariness of our heroine, Peri, a 15-year-old girl from a small fishing village. Her father was recently lost at sea and her mother sunk into depression; Peri has responded by moving into an abandoned house, and rarely interacts with others except as required by her job scrubbing floors at the local inn. Most fantasy protagonists are portrayed as better than those around them, whether through lineage or abilities or personality or some combination, which is a rather toxic worldview if imbibed too often and uncritically. Peri is decidedly not, though some unusual things happen to her and she does discover her magical talent (which is not the story’s focus). She’s believable as a poor villager: she doesn’t have a big dreams, she doesn’t read for enjoyment, she works for a living and is often seen doing so. Her firmer and more articulate coworker, Mare, seems perhaps the more natural heroine. But in the context of this story, Peri’s baffled acceptance of whatever comes works well; she’s endearing and easy to sympathize with. The supporting characters meanwhile are deftly drawn and engaging, and their dialogue brings them to life despite the book’s short length. Though at 137 pages this is a very short novel, it feels complete, and probably double the length of recent novelettes that are stretched through various formatting tricks to reach that same page count. It also has that ageless quality of books written from before YA was an established genre with its own expectations and tropes. Peri is 15, but I think this could be enjoyed at any age and isn’t written specifically to teen concerns. Indeed, Peri ultimately moves back in with her mom, rather than out as one might expect in a teen novel! Notably for me, this is my fifth McKillip, and her writing hasn’t gone sour for me yet! The climax and ending here make perfect sense, unlike some of her others, although I wasn’t thrilled with the idea of Peri’s getting romantically involved with Lyo; the age and experience gap feels very large. I’d rank those of her books I’ve read as follows: 1) The Forgotten Beasts of Eld 2) The Changeling Sea 3 & 4) Ombria in Shadow and Alphabet of Thorn 5) The Bards of Bone Plain (the only dud so far) While I don’t expect this book to stick with me, it’s beautiful and bittersweet and expertly written, and I didn’t want it to end. A little gem of a story."

Her writing has such luscious descriptions you just want to gather them all up and devour them like precious edible gold. It’s just amazing how she manages to spill her wonderful imagination out into the pages and spin a story with the skills to back it up. Sure this novel (a novella almost, really) is short but I really loved how she takes a familiar aspect in fairy lore (the switching of babies) and places it in an entirely different setting. Her transformation of it is fabulous and I thought worked really well with the sea backdrop. The characters may not be so deeply explored but we see them shine on the pages that they are on. The ending of this book was very quiet compared to the mysterious and overwhelming sense of mystery and pull we had at the beginning, which I think made for a nice contrast. It’s almost bittersweet but we are left with such pleased emotions after. I know everyone has said this already but this tale is exactly that: lovely. A lovely, lovely tale with some of the most beautiful writing published."

        "text":"Its my second book by Patricia McKillip after the The Riddle-Master of Hed . I liked that book but I loved this one. It is a short, simple and beautifully written book. It is a story of a girl, two princes, one magician and a sea dragon. After Perriwinkle's father's death, her mother is in a deep depression. Peri has stopped living with her mother and has started living in an old woman's abandoned house near the sea. Though she visits her mother occasionally but her mother rarely acknowledge her presence. With each passing day Peri is getting more and more frustrated. One day when she couldn't bear anymore. She uses a little magic and hexes the sea and curses it. This sets a series of events in motion and Peri finds herself between two princes and their wishes to live in a place they crave for. Peri is a very intriguing character. She is introvert and alone, a girl craving her mother's love and attention. When her father who was a fisher dies in the sea, her mother starts thinking that her father is alive and is in a Kingdom that exist under the sea. That is one of the reason that she wants to unravel the mystery of the sea. She is a brave girl and her courage earns her the trust and respect of the men around her. Its a fairy tale kind of story and McKillip has told this in a wonderful way. Her writing has lyrical feel to it. The story is short yet it has a great character development. All in all its a story of magic, mystery, fear, courage, hope and love."

        "text":"Originally reviewed on The Book Smugglers In a small fishing village on the coast of the wide, stormy sea, a bright-eyed young woman named Periwinkle makes her home. After her father, a fisherman, rows out his ship and never returns, Peri's mother lapses into quiet despair, forgetting to talk and always staring out at the roiling sea and fantasizing about the people that live in its depths. Without her parents to watch over her or remind her to do things like brush her hair or hem her clothes, Peri grows from a quiet child to a wild and somewhat neglected young woman - her hair always a tangle, her dresses bleached of all color, too tight in some places, too loose in others. Even the old wise woman who used to brush Peri's hair in her small cottage disappears one day, leaving Peri without anyone to care for her at all. During the day, she works at the local inn, scrubbing floors and cleaning rooms; by night, she returns to the old woman's cottage and makes her own isolated home where she plots her revenge against the sea. Hateful of the ocean that has taken both of her parents away, Peri crafts three crude hexes to curse the sea - it is here that she meets Prince Kir, who also knew the wise woman and years for her counsel. Kir has deep troubles of his own, also connected to the watery depths, and hopes that Peri can help him make his peace with the ocean that haunts his every waking moment. When Peri finishes her hexes and throws them deep into the great water, she also includes an offering from Kir - and to Peri's great astonishment, her hexes start to work . A great sea dragon starts to appear amongst the fishermen's boats on the sea, with an impossibly large gold chain around its neck. Then, a magician comes to town, promising that he will be able to remove the chain and give the gold to the villagers - for a price. And most importantly, Kir's dreams of the sea grow more fevered and frantic, as his own unknown, hidden past catches up to him. And it is all up to Periwinkle to set everything back to rights. To date, I've only read a handful of books and short stories from Patricia McKillip, mostly her recent releases. The Changeling Sea , however, is one of McKillip's earlier works, originally published in the 1980s and instantly endeared itself to me - a changeling fable that takes place by the stormy sea? What better place to jump into McKillip's rich and extensive backlist? And you know what? I absolutely loved this book. Shortly put: The Changeling Sea is another gorgeous, wonderful book from the incredibly talented McKillip. I'm going to say something that sounds incredibly cheesy, but it is so very true: Patricia McKillip has a way with words that is simply magical. Like The Bell at Sealey Head or The Bards of Bone Plain , The Changeling Sea is a slender book, but one written with lush and evocative prose that is as beautiful as it is simple. For example: A sigh, smelling of shrimp and seaweed, wafted over the water... In the deep waters beyond the stones, a great flaming sea-thing gazed back at her, big as a house or two, its mouth a strainer like the mouth of a baleen whale, its translucent fiery streamers coiling and uncoiling languorously in the warm waters. The brow fins over its wide eyes gave it a surprised expression. Around its neck, like a dog collar, was a massive chain of pure gold. Beautiful, no? Such is McKillip's writing, littered throughout with these gleaming gems of description and story. Love and anger are like land and sea: They meet at many different places. As the title suggests, The Changeling Sea is a fable about a changeling, and a story whose heart is inextricably tied to the sea. It's a book about love - no, scratch that. It's actually a book about yearning for what once was, and what can never be again. It's the book of a King that yearns for the beauty of the sea queen in all her splendor, the story of two brothers crossed at birth that yearn for their true homes on sea and on land. It's the story of a wild haired, barefooted fisherman's daughter that dares hex the spiteful sea, and yearns for the love of one that can never return it. Aren't these some of the best of all? These stories of want and hate and love, all jumbled up into one powerful package of emotion? And then there are the characters! Periwinkle, our heroine, is a pinched and angry character at first, who scowls at the ocean but refuses to leave its shores despite her hate. She's bold and wild, who cares little about the conventions that bind others - she doesn't have secret dreams of catching the prince's eye like the other girls who work at the inn, and she doesn't pay attention to her clothes or her hair. She's smart but rough around the edges, passionate but obstinate - and for all that, a character you cannot help but love, flaws and all. There is the tortured Kir, who is...well, defined by his yearning for the ocean and his feeling that he does not belong on dry land. There's also the sea dragon himself, who is not at all what he seems, and a king that has made mistakes in his past but loves his children and lovers dearly. But for all that, my other favorite character in this beautiful little book is Lyo - the canny magician, with his smiling face and his penchant for twisting magic in delightful, unexpected ways. All in all, I loved The Changeling Sea , and absolutely recommend it. I cannot wait to try more of Patricia McKillip's work - now, any suggestions on where to go next?"

As the story progressed, though, I found that it seemed to lack the depth that I was hoping it would have. It could have been really good, but I found myself unable to connect with any of the characters. I liked that Kir was so desperate to get into the sea, but he was also aloof and unreachable, and I found his relationship with Peri rather forced. What reason did he have to love her, or her him? It seemed to be convenient for the author for them to be in love, but the story didn't back it up, and because of that, any sense of loss that should have come at the end of the story was missing, and I found the end rather unsatisfying, since the whole book pointed to exactly what would happen (but not how) all along, and there weren't any surprises once we got there, except perhaps, for the magician's sudden attraction to Peri."

        "text":"The sea has always fascinated me, mayhap because I was born near one and usually went to sleep lulled by the sound of its waves. It could also be because I have loved its might, which made me feel totally insignificant in the entire realm of things or maybe because I always stood tall before the sea, almost as if I were challenging it to do its worst, while it gently responded to me by lapping at my feet, almost caressing me and soothing away my pain and anger. I will never know the exact reason but I believe that it is a combination of all this and more, which makes the sea a special entity in my life. Are you wondering why I am waxing poetry about the sea? Don’t worry, I have not gone completely nutty, it’s just that this book is set in a place by the sea and deals with both the magic as well as the mysterious nature of the sea. This is my first book by the author and I must take time to point out that she definitely writes a lyrical story, one that is both high on imagination as well as story building. A true page turner that leaves you spellbound at every moment. It was almost as if the author had a magical romantic tryst with herself while writing this book, her love and passion flows through the pages and the story, leaving the reader feeling warm and yet seeking an unknown that is both within reach as well as beyond. The story is about a girl, Peri or Periwinkle, a floor scrubber in an inn, who loses her father to the sea. Her mother, devastated by this loss is almost like a mute sculpture, which adds to the loss felt by Peri. She hates the sea for the loss of her loved ones and with the help of an old woman in the village, she manages to hex the sea. Of course, she doesn’t believe that her hexes will come true and goes about her work as usual. During this period, she meets the Prince Kir, son of the King of that country, who truly yearns for the sea as no one else can. The story moves onto include a magician Lyo, a sea dragon and some wonderful twists and turns, ultimately leading to a wonderful story, which is both romantic and poignant. Where the story starts with a very light and sweet note, it quickly takes its turn to the mysterious and magical. What made me really like this book was the fact that the twists and turns do not seem to be forced or a farce. You move with it, experiencing the pain, angst, love, magic and all other elements that are thrown in together and faced by the characters. Each character is extremely believable and well developed. Whether it is the anguished Prince Kir or the lost sea dragon or the beguiling magician or even Peri, the main heroine, they are all believable and definitely characters that you can relate to. I loved the writing, which as I mentioned earlier is totally magical. I usually don’t have favourite quotes or passages from the books I read or rather don’t usually mention them but there were two in this book that really struck me, which makes me want to share it here to explain just how poetic the writing can be. Of course, I can be accused of liking cheesy writing by some, but honestly to me it was magical. When asked to explain what magic was, the magician Lyo says these words: “Magic is like night, when you first encounter it. A vast black full of shapes… slowly you learn to turn the dark into shapes, colors… it’s like a second dawn is breaking over the world. You see something most people can’t see and yet it seems clear as the nose on your face. That there’s nothing in the world that doesn’t possess its share of magic.” And at a later stage when explaining how he knows when Peri calls him, he tells her this “I listen,” he said obscurely. “If you listen hard enough, you begin to hear things… the sorrow beneath the smile, the voice within the fire dragon, the secret in the young floor-scrubber’s voice, behind all the talk of gold…” Overall this is a simple story that is told beautifully, full of magic that makes you feel as if you are being soothed and rioted by the waves of the sea. So if you are in a mood to relax and enjoy a simple story, with some magic and beautiful presentation, do pick this one up and I can guarantee that you will enjoy it."

        "text":"\"Only the black pearl in her pocket told her that mystery had come into her life and gone, leaving her stranded at the tide's edge, yearning.\" The Changeling Sea was absolutely mesmerising. It was actually one of the earliest books recommended to me here on GoodReads, along with the author Patricia McKillip in general. For some reason, I've always felt rather reluctant to read her books. The summaries, cover arts and reviews of all her works seemed as though they held stories I would love - but for some unexplainable reason, I always felt worried that I wouldn't. If The Changeling Sea is anything to go by, I have absolutely no more fear of venturing into more of McKillip's tales! The Changeling Sea is short - part of me wishes there were more, but then it is perfect as it is. I seem to have fallen in love with the characters just as they fell in love with the sea. I can't quite put my finger on it - despite the short time spent with them, I found myself caring for them deeply and wishing for them all to find their happiness - which at times did not always seem likely. The narration is hauntingly beautiful - there are only a few books (interestingly, all short ones) that I have come across with a similar dream-like and magical atmosphere. It was almost a little melancholic at times but it had enough magic, wonder and a little humour to keep you hopeful. I've only recently finished the book and I already feel like reading it again. I don't even know how else to put it - I just absolutely loved it."

        "text":"It's no secret that Patricia McKillip is a most beloved author for so many fantasy readers. I discovered her late in the game, when I ran across a beautiful reissued omnibus edition of The Riddle-master Trilogy in a Barnes & Noble several years ago. After finishing that excellent trilogy, I went looking for any other McKillip books I could get my hands on. The result was a binge, of sorts, in which I blew through six or seven titles without a by-your-leave. And it was an immensely good time. But it did result in a little bit of fatigue, as her writing style is very specific and lyrical and I wound up needing to cleanse my palate a little after. Since then I've re-read a few of my favorites here and there, particularly the Riddle-Master and The Book of Atrix Wolfe , but not since The Tower at Stony Wood 's release have I picked up one of her new ones. While I was perusing the McKillip section on my shelves the other night, the slender little volume THE CHANGELING SEA caught my eye and I got to thinking it might be time to get back on the McKillip wagon. Originally published in 1988, this young adult fantasy has stood the test of time. Firebird put out the pretty little edition pictured on the right in 2003 and, having worked hard to find my own used copy, I was happy to see new life breathed into it. I also think it's the most accurate artistic representation of Peri herself and the spiraling, mesmerizing tone of the novel. Nobody ever really noticed Periwinkle. She and her small family have always been a bit on their own, quietly living out their lives in their sleepy fishing village. And then the year she turns fifteen, Peri is suddenly really and truly alone for the first time in her young life. It seems the sea has taken everything that she loves. First her father who drowned and now her mother who failed to get over her father's death to the point where she no longer talks to Peri at all. And so Peri spends her days working as a chamber maid, scrubbing floors at the local inn, and her nights trying desperately to curse the sea that's been the source of all her sorrow. Magic has always been a part of Peri's world, though it's never made itself known with quite such a presence as it does the day the King arrives in town with his son Prince Kir. The unhappy prince has a problem that plagues him, a problem he hopes Peri may be able to help him with. If she will just include something of his in her latest curse, perhaps the longing that rides him will abate. Neither of them expect the sea monster who rises as a result. A sea monster bound by a golden chain and from that point on, nothing is the same in Peri's life, and it is with gratitude she accepts the help of the wizard Lyo--a sort of local wise man. Between the four of them--the girl, the prince, the wizard, and the dragon--they piece together the mystery of what happened in that same place so many years ago and why it's rearing its ugly head now. I loved Peri instantly and without reserve. From the very first page, she is not your classic fairy tale heroine. The opening lines: No one really knew where Peri lived the year after the sea took her father and cast his boat, shrouded in a tangle of fishing net, like an empty shell back onto the beach. She came home when she chose to, sat at her mother's hearth without talking, brooding sullenly at the small, quiet house with the glass floats her father had found, colored bubbles of light, still lying on the dusty windowsill, and the same crazy quilt he had slept under still on the bed, and the door open on quiet evenings to the same view of the village and the harbor with the fishing boats homing in on the incoming tide. Sometimes her mother would rouse herself and cook; sometimes Peri would eat, sometimes she wouldn't. She hated the vague, lost expression on her mother's face, her weary movements. Her hair had begun to gray; she never smiled, she never sang. The sea, it seemed to Peri, had taken her mother as well as her father, and left some stranger wandering despairingly among her cooking pots. She is not beautiful or poised or charming or sweet. But she is kind and determined and involved in unraveling the mystery from beginning to end. She earns the trust of the men around her before (if) she earns their love and we (and they) are frequently reminded of her flaws, from scraped knees to a nose on the large side. Urchin from top to bottom, it is most definitely what's inside that matters with this girl. And it matters quite a lot as so many come to depend on her, including the unusual and wondrous creature from the sea who is himself not exactly what he seems. As is always the case with a McKillip tale, the poetic language and gracefully interwoven magic lend a golden glow to the whole. At the same time, this is one of her more \"real\" stories. Peri is so real. Cloaked in the unreal and unbelievable elements around her, she remains focused and bright. Clocking in at a scant 144 pages, it is also a prime (and all-too- rare) example of a book I don't wish longer. It's perfect just as it is, especially the ending. The briefness only accentuates the sweetness and strangeness and I never fail to finish it at ease with my world and hers."

        "text":"An emotionally rich, well-plotted sea yarn from a generally excellent fantasy author. The half-human\/half-otherwordly love triangle reminds me more than a little of Robin McKinley's Hero and the Crown , particularly in the way the afterlife is evoked to allow for a layered resolution; the debonair young wizard character has a whiff of Diana Wynne Jones's Howl about him, and the rustically witchy protagonist a whiff of Jones's Sophie, with her talent for \"talking life into things\"; the heart-tugging minor chords of the story's emotional palette, revolving around the inexorable power of the sea to take and keep what it pleases, put me in mind of John Allison's The Case of the Fire Inside , among other great selkie stories. This is a book with something to say about bereavement, mourning, and closure, and also about literature\/storytelling\/writing, which seems to be the true subject of this passage that is nominally about magic: He smiled, his eyes, facing the sun, full of light. “Magic is like night, when you first encounter it.” “Night?” she said doubtfully. She skipped a beat with one oar and the Sea Urchin spun a half-circle. “A vast black full of shapes . . .” He trailed his fingers overboard and the Sea Urchin turned its bow toward the horizon again. “Slowly you learn to turn the dark into shapes, colors. . . . It’s like a second dawn breaking over the world. You see something most people can’t see and yet it seems clear as the nose on your face. That there’s nothing in the world that doesn’t possess its share of magic. Even an empty shell, a lump of lead, an old dead leaf—you look at them and learn to see, and then to use, and after a while you can’t remember ever seeing the world any other way. Everything connects to something else....” This was my third McKillip novel after Winter Rose , which was very formative for me, and The Book of Atrix Wolfe , which I honestly don't remember at all. I would rank it somewhere between the two -- quite satisfying."

What's more, her imagination reads like a fairy tale--vivid descriptions, half folk-lore, half reality itself. Yet, the romance is key in The Changeling Sea --key to feeling that bittersweet ache at the close of the novel. And, as you may be able to imagine, I felt very little. With older fantasy tales, a love story usually consists of a form of insta-love: one or two friendly interactions before BAM! true love hits. McKillip's brand of fantasy romance just didn't work for me. I suspect, much like Robin McKinley, here lies another wonderful author whose works will simply continue to elude me."

        "text":"I'd give this all the starfish in the sea if I could! It's the perfect introduction for anyone new to McKillip's work: it's short but absolutely amazing, it's in print, and it's inexpensive! \"The old woman had made her living weaving. When Peri was younger, she would come to sit at the woman's side and watch the shuttle dart in and out of the loom. The old woman told stories then, strange, wonderful tales of a land beneath the sea where houses were built of pearls, and a constant, powdery shower of gold fell like light through the deep water from the sunken wrecks of mortals' ships.\" (3) \" Come out of the sea and into my heart My dark, my shining love. Promise we shall never part, My dark, my singing love...\" (italics and ellipsis original, 6) This slim little book - a mere 137 pages! - is a masterwork of storytelling. For years, I'd mistakenly thought that this was a children's story, but it's perfect for any age and I'm so glad I finally bought a copy! I'm a huge McKillip fan, and I collect her work. Unfortunately, so much of it is out of print these days. Periwinkle, whimsically named for the way she'd pluck winkles from her father's drying fishing nets as a child, is grieving. Her father has been lost at sea, and her mother's heart and mind have followed him. Peri is 15, and works as a maid at the local inn. Left to her own devices, she dwells mostly in the shack by the sea owned by the local wise woman, who fancied herself a witch. She was like a second mother to Peri, and she too has recently disappeared, yet another loss. Peri is incredibly angry at the sea, and in her hurt, she crafts willow hexes and throws them into the waves. Little does she know that the curses she learned from the wise woman are far more powerful than she ever could have imagined! They bring a gold-chained sea dragon and the King's dark, handsomely brooding son to her door, along with an old mystery. The townsfolk forget their fear of the dragon, dazzled by greed for its chain and the freedom that much gold would bring. They constantly speculate on the best way to take the chain, and the rumour of their desire reaches a young magician, Lyo, who is very good at listening and senses a deeper story in the captivity of the sea dragon. Together, Peri and Lyo unravel the secrets of the kingdom, and of the land beneath the sea. For anyone who loves the ocean as I do, this is a treat! You can almost smell the salt sea air and hear the waves break on the shore. A truly touching story to treasure, of love, loss and letting go."

        "text":"If you've ever flirted with the possibility of taking on a reading challenge or a reading project (either self-imposed or group generated), I can't be enthusiastic enough in encouraging you to do so. My self-imposed “70 from the 70s” project (my third reading project in two years), that I started this past summer, has introduced me to three new writers who have quickly become “top 10” favorites of mine and has also opened the door to several handfuls of riveting “new” reads. Zilpha Keatley Snyder is one of these three “new” writers. Even though Ms. Snyder lived to be almost 90-years-old and wrote FORTY-SIX books between 1964 and 2011, I wasn't familiar with her, until about two years ago, when some Goodreads friends put her on my radar (thank you!). Wow. When I think of how much nonsense I read in my school library while these books lurked in the background. . . As far as I'm concerned, Ms. Snyder's books are right up there with Beverly Cleary's and Judy Blume's. She has a rare gift of turning a middle grades read into a young adult read (there is a strong distinction between these two genres that is often overlooked on here), and an even more rare gift of making all of her reads as appealing to the adult as to the child. I know this may feel like a cryptic reading response, but I'm not sure that I can go any further with this work of fiction without either spoiling it for you or bursting out crying. Let's just say that Ms. Snyder explores class differences and generational poverty here, and when one girl named Ivy can't bear the weight of being made to feel “low class” and “worthless,” she embraces the idea that she is a changeling , a child switched at birth by some enchanted folk. And now I'm a changeling . I'm forever changed by this story."

        "text":"This is a wonderful book, we were instantly drawn in to the story, the characters, the plot, the friendship, the imaginary games, all really appealed to us. Two seven year old girls meet and they are from contrasting backgrounds. Martha's family is highly respectable whereas Ivy's family have problems, mum drinks too much, brothers in jail etc. Ivy has an Aunt who sometimes looks after her when things get bad, she sounds lovely, but poor Martha, despite their outward show of respectability, her family ridicule and neglect her and care more about what others think than if Martha is happy. I appreciated this author's awareness that behind the facade of respectability, the wealthy family were awful to their children in other ways. The story focuses on the girls friendship and imaginary play, they spend their time outdoors and make a world of their own. I loved this, and just as this book shows children are pressured into appearing to be grown up and not behaving like children, what could be more natural and healthy than 7yr olds playing imaginary games ? The character of Kelly is a good example in my opinion of what happens to children who don't do this, there is a character like Kelly in most schools unfortunately. The observations of this character were accurate and how true that adults and teachers often are mislead by the chatty, popular, Kellys of this world. We loved the way the girls were so caring to each other, and helped each other stand up to the bullies, how they also cared for animals and tried to help and rescue ones in need of help. This was a 5 star story for us, but although the climax was fitting for the story Kelly says she overheard Martha and Ivy talk about being responsible for a break in at the school, and because she is a favourite she is believed. We felt this was tied up too quickly by her brothers admission and reasons why he did it. Tom's involvement with drugs seemed a sudden addition to the story. The ending was good but it seemed as though several years were condensed into a chapter or two. Ending problems aside this was a beautiful book, and the girls thoughts on the term 'changeling' was an appropriate ending for the story."

What a writer! The Changeling remains, along with \"The Velvet room\", another one by this author, one of my all time faves. Have you ever felt like a \"Changeling\"? Did you feel like when in childhood? Even for a moment? I think most of us have. In the case of Ivy and Martha..WELL..I am not going to say! This book is a celebration of Martha, of Ivy and all the Changelings here, there and everywhere. It is worth noting, if you missed this one in childhood no matter. I did a reread recently..the person who had it before me had written in the book \"This is a good book!\". I do not even know that person. So then I reread, loaned it to a friend and she loved it too. The Changeling transcends age and time. Will always be a classic."

        "text":"Buddy read with Hilary, here's Hilary's Review (it's better than mine :D) It may not be obvious from title and the blurb, but this story is not Fantasy, nor Magical Realism. Even as a kid I was not much of a reader of realistic fiction, I preferred Fantasy stories. But there were a few exceptions, and I think this would have been one of them, if I'd read it as a young person. Since I've read books by this author before, including another that is realistic fiction, The Velvet Room (which was one of my favorites as a kid), I was not surprised how well she really captures the thoughts and feelings of childhood, the experience from the perspective of a kid, but I was very delighted by it here. This story really captures how magical shared imagination is in childhood with a good friend. The make-believe, the magical thinking - even when knowing it's make believe, the close bond of friendship and how impactful that can be, helping to shape who we grow up to be. For parents: While playing and imagining the girls do mention things about being someone else in a past life, and create make believe spells, etc. If you're particular about that sort of thing, be aware. Also, there are a couple mentions of High School students doing drugs. In one place it's pills (non-specified), in another it's pot. It's not delved into, and doesn't involve the MC, but it is there. So, this one might be better for MG readers who are on the older side of that range."

        "text":"The Book Gods sent THE CHANGELING to me at precisely the right time in life. I was a lonely little girl who loved to dream, hated sports, and cried easily. Not surprisingly, I was widely hated by my peers, and sought refuge in books. And while I loved being transported to magical places like Oz and Narnia, I was intensely aware that these books had little bearing on \"real life.\" THE CHANGELING was different. It was about a young girl growing up in a status-conscious family. Her older brother and sister were terribly popular, while her parents were successful and sophisticated. Naturally, Martha feels like an ugly duckling surrounded by swans. Then Ivy Carson comes to town. Ivy's family is utterly disreputable and lets her run wild. Soon, Ivy recruits Martha as her best friend, confiding that she's actually not a Carson, but a changeling -- an child of magical origin who was switched at birth. Soon, the girls are performing witchy ceremonies and create a fantasy realm to which they escape on a regular basis. Not surprisingly, their friendship becomes a lightning rod for school bullies, and is nearly torn apart when Ivy is forced to admit that she isn't a changeling, but an ordinary girl who can't vanquish her real-life enemies. Although I was disappointed that Ivy wasn't truly a changeling, I took comfort in this story, which depicts a girl who uses the idea of magic to realize her creative talent. It's beautiful to see how Ivy's friendship transforms Martha into a shy mouse into a talented actress. If that's not magic, I don't know what is. This book is also beautifully illustrated by Alton Raible. It's lovely to see an illustrator that perfectly captures the spirit of a book. I wish more books had interior illustrations...this seems to becoming a lost art. Thank heavens somebody had the sense to put this book back in print. It's a real gem and deserves your time if you're seeking to make a personal transformation of your own."

        "text":"Writing a review for this treasured volume from my childhood seems impossible. Since first making the attempt, I have spent hours staring at the blank screen in front of me, have begun in a hundred different ways - \"Some books aren't books at all, but mirrors...\" \/ \"Zilpha Keatley Snyder may not know it, but she wrote this book about me...\" - but have always ended with the same admission of failure, with the same deletion of whatever facile comments I had typed, whatever little bits of text I had produced - text that had inevitably failed to capture the terrible beauty and power of The Changeling , its strange and elusive appeal, its unshakable hold on me. I am haunted by this book, and although I pride myself on being able to articulate even the most difficult of thoughts and emotions, I find it impossible to say why. Just as it once saved me, this seemingly simple children's novel now defeats me. Again and again. I am too close to it, perhaps... I grew up in a beautiful old house on a hill, with a rundown old carriage house behind it, where my sisters and I were wont to play in younger days. A dreamer, always, I lived in my own world, dividing my time between the pages of whatever book I was devouring, and my imaginary (year-round) outdoor games. Naturally, I had a country of my own - ironically, given my childhood ignorance of the word \"arcane,\" it was named Arcania - with its own intricate history, customs and culture. I spent hours creating the Arcanian language, and crafting its script (sadly, all lost to me today), with its superfluity of vowel forms. Arcania was my retreat and my stronghold, in a world that was beginning - just as I was starting to search for meaning in it - to make no sense, and was as real to me as anything I experienced in my more mundane, \"workday\" life. No author has ever captured - for me - that reality of the imaginary, that power of childhood make-believe, with the same skill as Zilpha Keatly Snyder, in The Changeling . The story of two very different young girls - shy crybaby Martha, so worried about fitting in with her successful family, and wildly idiosyncratic Ivy Carson, daughter of the town's local criminal element - whose friendship is the salvation of both, it perfectly embodies one of the key realities of my own childhood: the role of imagination, and of the internal world, in creating a safe place in a decidedly unsafe existence. Like Ivy and Martha, whose created world was known as Green Sky - a world that Snyder would later use, in creating her brilliant dystopian Green Sky trilogy ( Below the Root , And All Between , Until the Celebration ) - I too enacted a complicated series of rituals and plays surrounding my imagined world. Like them, this had extraordinary meaning for me, and is, to this day, terribly precious to me. One of my favorite works of literature, of ANY kind, The Changeling is a book that has become entwined with my memories of my childhood, to the point that I cannot separate it out. I have lived in this book, as surely as Ivy and Martha did, and while I wouldn't venture to guarantee that it will speak to every young reader as it did (and does) to me, can readily attest to the fact that every word in it is true ."

        "text":"Snyder understands imaginative play and is able to convey the enchanted mood of creative children having their own special world. She has been recognized for doing this in her Newbery Honor book The Egypt Game , but I think it is handled even better in this book. This is a world that does not follow the conventional rules of established games and is kept separate from most grown-ups and children. The fantasy world that Ivy Carson (the self-proclaimed changeling) and her close friend Martha Abbott develop over years, however, is not the only side to this story. A great deal is about real-world activities that hinge upon Ivy's family and how they are received in the town and on how a family name can tar with a broad brush, sometimes unjustly. Both Ivy and Martha are misfits, out of place in their own families, but often swept along by the perceptions and prejudices of others (both within and outside of these families). I suspect that most readers identify with Martha than with Ivy. Hers is the perspective we get on the various happenings of the story (sometimes we get more with the convention of \"Martha heard about it later in bits and pieces\"), and I think this creates an intimacy where we, as readers, understand and sympathize with Martha while everyone else doesn't. Ivy, on the other hand, is a mystery - we know what she tells Martha, but is it true? The story has a timeless feel to some degree, although some specifics of the real-world happenings ground it in a late 1960s to early 1970s timeframe. I think it's set in southern California, like many of Snyder's books (and I think there is a connection to her earlier book The Velvet Room - both make reference to a Montoya family, with an old house surrounded by a fruit orchard). I could see it being rewritten to set it in a different time, but I don't think there is any need to update it to make it relevant for youngsters to whom 1970 is the time of their grandparents. What really matters about this book goes beyond its setting. By and large, the supporting characters are not wooden stereotypes that you know from other books; they behave realistically with their own idiosyncrasies. Only Kelly fits the \"popular mean girl\" mold, but even she is someone you have probably met in your own life, not an exaggeration or a caricature. I especially appreciated the inclusion of Mrs. Smith, an older woman who is nevertheless something of a kindred spirit to the young girls. The book covers a number of years (from Martha in second to tenth grade), and what is particularly unusual about it is how Ivy unexpectedly disappears for long stretches of time, eventually returning just as unexpectedly. In the meantime we continue following Martha, seeing how she reacts to the absence and how she develops on her own. Then we see the two friends reunite, sometimes as if no time had passed, sometimes unsurely. Their fantasy talk and play develops, and I especially liked how it developed in middle school when they reviewed their older activities and \"curated\" them into presentations for younger children. After a bit of a surprise climax, we learn of how Martha matures. We are given a little glimpse of new things in her life that could be big changes. In some ways this feels like a very satisfying wrap up. But then there is yet another final chapter that adds more information and suggests other possibilities. This is another example of how Snyder refuses to give us a conventional cookie-cutter story. In addition to the connections to The Velvet Room and The Egypt Game , there's also a link to Snyder's Green Sky trilogy (beginning with Below the Root ), which is an entirely fantastical tale, developing out of the stories and situations that Ivy and Martha create. I don't think there are prerequisites for reading and enjoying any of these books, but those who have experience with more of Snyder's catalog may be rewarded with additional insights. I have found Madeleine L'Engle to be another author where this is true. Illustrations by Snyder's frequent collaborator Alton Raible are distinctive and add to the mood."

I'm sure, in fact I hope, that she didn't marry Rufus. That she moved to New York City, and became a Broadway actress. Hung out with Andy Warhol, went to Studio 54. In the late 80s, she gave it all up and moved to Vermont, where she opened a small theater that did summer stock. Or maybe an acting school. In her 50s, she's made a comeback on Broadway. Or she's doing voice over work for an animated superhero series. Or she starred in Company as Joanne. Or more likely, she moved to San Francisco, where she had lots of gay friends who died of AIDs in the 80s, became politically active, started an underground theater group, married the guy of her dreams, had some fabulous children, outshone Cath and Tom (who are in their sixties now; her parents are at least in their 80s, probably in their 90s). Ivy became a modern ballet dancer, moved to New York. Or Paris. Had a string of lovers. Flirted with bisexuality. Knew and was known by everyone. Currently writing her memoir, where she will reveal everything. Kelly Peters is fat and lives in Modesto. The Changeling is a really terrific book, and hasn't really grown stale with age. It's still just as poignant as when I first read it, so many years ago."

The girl friendship\/coming of age theme is nothing new, but if ZKS had written for an adult audience, she could have been the Elena Ferrante of her time. ZKS creates that perfect blend of mostly realism, with just a whisper of magic. I would still love to join Martha and Ivy and the Tree People at Bent Oaks Grove. I had forgotten (or maybe my childhood self didn't quite get) just how funny young Martha and Ivy are. The porkchop\/paint scene and the attempted rescue of Dolly are hysterical. Although my heart aches for Ivy, I am so impressed with how ZKS captures Martha's social anxiety and introverted nature: \"...but a lot of things that seemed as simple as breathing to other people, still seemed as far away as the stars for Martha.\" In an interesting way, the climactic reveal with Tom is both dated and not dated."

But then Ivy Carson shows up. The Carsons are not a respectable kind of family, and the father and sons are regularly in trouble with the law. They move often, but just as often return to the dilapidated old family home nearby. But Ivy is nice in a strange sort of away and she has a vivid imagination, even believing herself to be a \"changeling\" (\"I think I might be a wood nymph or water sprite or something like that.\"). And she's just the sort of friend Martha needs. This was a really sweet book about childhood friendship through the years. Not only do we get Martha's perspective of being something of a disappointment to her family, but we eventually get Ivy's frustrations of the way she's treated because of hers. It's one of those middle-grade books that just feels mature and even important - not silly or action-packed - just nice. I was a bit surprised at how casually drug use was discussed at one point in the story, but I guess since the book was written in 1970 the author was trying to be \"hip\" to all that. But other than that weirdness, it was a really nice story."

I think I got it from the Scholastic Book Company when I was in second grade (1971 or 1972); we lived in a very rural area in northern New Mexico and my mother basically allowed me to order every book I wanted when the Scholastic catalog came. I know I then read it many, many times over the years that followed... and then, of course, at some point it got packed away with the rest of my \"kid's books\" and I haven't touched it in ages. But now, as it goes, I'm \"old enough for fairy tales again\" (not that I really ever stopped - I'm not a Gryffindor for nothing), and I found it again when I was recommended other books by Keatley-Snyder. While looking those up, I found \"The Changeling\" again. I knew this book had been very formative for my young mind, I just had forgotten quite how MUCH. I was Martha -- chubby, frightened of everything, burst into tears at the slightest thing; the main difference was I was the oldest child in the family, and, of course, I never had an Ivy. I wanted to be like Martha when I was young, because I was sure I would grow up like she did, tall and slim and loved by everyone... but I never made it THERE. I stayed chubby, but I did end up in all the plays in high school, as a character actor. I made up stories, I wrote them down, I dreamed and wished and never wanted to grow up (and really, that spell DOES work)... I never got thin, but I eventually met my own \"Ivy.\" I didn't meet her early enough to dream with me on that childhood level, but we plan on growing old together, if possibly never grown UP together (because she loved the book, too). I know I don't say a whole lot about the actual book here, but my review is based on feelings and impressions rather than the events in the story. Needless to say, it still holds up just as beautifully as it did then -- sure, now it only took me about two hours to read instead of weeks... but I still lost myself just as deeply within the beautiful lines that Keatley-Snyder wove here. I only wish I could be as brilliant a storyteller (not to say I don't TRY). I still love this book - I love the story, the characters, my feelings and impressions when I read it and how it makes me feel afterward. Beautiful, dreamy, mystic, alien, lost, found, sure of myself, unsure, scared, exhilarated, joyous... everything. Everything. I think this book may have been everything to my growing up. I've never lost it. Know all the questions, but never the answers."

Magic in the story, and in the reshaping of their realities into what they wanted, and needed, them to be, and magic in their friendship. This is a beautiful book about the power of imagination, and female friendship, and those crazy years between being a kid and being a teenager. Martha is every kid who feels like they don't belong and Ivy is the one kid who has never been concerned with belonging. I think Ivy is the kid adults wish they had been... not in such a hurry to grow up, continuing to believe in magic long after most had given it up, and who dreams and runs and dances with joy and without caring what the world thinks. I read this with my 11 year-old daughter and I want those things for her. To have an Ivy or to BE an Ivy. To play and dream and create and to just be a kid, as long as possible."

This has an episodic structure that threatens to be overbearing: the adventures of two imaginative outsiders are charming, evocative, sympathetic, but also frivolous. It's the cumulative effect which matters more, and while Martha's arc is dated (fat reader surrogates are fantastic; fat reader surrogates who lose weight while gaining confidence is problematic) her emotional growth still resonates and the relationship between the girls has sincere chemistry. Ivy is by far the more interesting, dynamic character; Martha is a conservative PoV choice, but Snyder's compassion prevents Ivy's story from becoming a morality lesson and off-centering the most thoughtful parts of the narrative is something I suspect would age well with the reader. I would have liked this more as a younger reader; the restrained, episodic style means there's nothing especially engaging for an incoming adult reader. But I think I would have liked it very much indeed, and still appreciate Snyder's humor and humanity."

My self-imposed “70 from the 70s” project (my third reading project in two years), that I started this past summer, has introduced me to three new writers who have quickly become “top 10” favorites of mine and has also opened the door to several handfuls of riveting “new” reads. Zilpha Keatley Snyder is one of these three “new” writers. Even though Ms. Snyder lived to be almost 90-years-old and wrote FORTY-SIX books between 1964 and 2011, I wasn't familiar with her, until about two years ago, when some Goodreads friends put her on my radar (thank you!). Wow. When I think of how much nonsense I read in my school library while these books lurked in the background. . . As far as I'm concerned, Ms. Snyder's books are right up there with Beverly Cleary's and Judy Blume's. She has a rare gift of turning a middle grades read into a young adult read (there is a strong distinction between these two genres that is often overlooked on here), and an even more rare gift of making all of her reads as appealing to the adult as to the child. I know this may feel like a cryptic reading response, but I'm not sure that I can go any further with this work of fiction without either spoiling it for you or bursting out crying. Let's just say that Ms. Snyder explores class differences and generational poverty here, and when one girl named Ivy can't bear the weight of being made to feel “low class” and “worthless,” she embraces the idea that she is a changeling , a child switched at birth by some enchanted folk. And now I'm a changeling . I'm forever changed by this story."

        "text":"This is a wonderful book, we were instantly drawn in to the story, the characters, the plot, the friendship, the imaginary games, all really appealed to us. Two seven year old girls meet and they are from contrasting backgrounds. Martha's family is highly respectable whereas Ivy's family have problems, mum drinks too much, brothers in jail etc. Ivy has an Aunt who sometimes looks after her when things get bad, she sounds lovely, but poor Martha, despite their outward show of respectability, her family ridicule and neglect her and care more about what others think than if Martha is happy. I appreciated this author's awareness that behind the facade of respectability, the wealthy family were awful to their children in other ways. The story focuses on the girls friendship and imaginary play, they spend their time outdoors and make a world of their own. I loved this, and just as this book shows children are pressured into appearing to be grown up and not behaving like children, what could be more natural and healthy than 7yr olds playing imaginary games ? The character of Kelly is a good example in my opinion of what happens to children who don't do this, there is a character like Kelly in most schools unfortunately. The observations of this character were accurate and how true that adults and teachers often are mislead by the chatty, popular, Kellys of this world. We loved the way the girls were so caring to each other, and helped each other stand up to the bullies, how they also cared for animals and tried to help and rescue ones in need of help. This was a 5 star story for us, but although the climax was fitting for the story Kelly says she overheard Martha and Ivy talk about being responsible for a break in at the school, and because she is a favourite she is believed. We felt this was tied up too quickly by her brothers admission and reasons why he did it. Tom's involvement with drugs seemed a sudden addition to the story. The ending was good but it seemed as though several years were condensed into a chapter or two. Ending problems aside this was a beautiful book, and the girls thoughts on the term 'changeling' was an appropriate ending for the story."

This book is a celebration of Martha, of Ivy and all the Changelings here, there and everywhere. It is worth noting, if you missed this one in childhood no matter. I did a reread recently..the person who had it before me had written in the book \"This is a good book!\". I do not even know that person.

Even as a kid I was not much of a reader of realistic fiction, I preferred Fantasy stories. But there were a few exceptions, and I think this would have been one of them, if I'd read it as a young person. Since I've read books by this author before, including another that is realistic fiction, The Velvet Room (which was one of my favorites as a kid), I was not surprised how well she really captures the thoughts and feelings of childhood, the experience from the perspective of a kid, but I was very delighted by it here. This story really captures how magical shared imagination is in childhood with a good friend. The make-believe, the magical thinking - even when knowing it's make believe, the close bond of friendship and how impactful that can be, helping to shape who we grow up to be. For parents: While playing and imagining the girls do mention things about being someone else in a past life, and create make believe spells, etc. If you're particular about that sort of thing, be aware. Also, there are a couple mentions of High School students doing drugs. In one place it's pills (non-specified), in another it's pot. It's not delved into, and doesn't involve the MC, but it is there. So, this one might be better for MG readers who are on the older side of that range."

Not surprisingly, I was widely hated by my peers, and sought refuge in books. And while I loved being transported to magical places like Oz and Narnia, I was intensely aware that these books had little bearing on \"real life.\" THE CHANGELING was different. It was about a young girl growing up in a status-conscious family. Her older brother and sister were terribly popular, while her parents were successful and sophisticated. Naturally, Martha feels like an ugly duckling surrounded by swans. Then Ivy Carson comes to town. Ivy's family is utterly disreputable and lets her run wild. Soon, Ivy recruits Martha as her best friend, confiding that she's actually not a Carson, but a changeling -- an child of magical origin who was switched at birth. Soon, the girls are performing witchy ceremonies and create a fantasy realm to which they escape on a regular basis. Not surprisingly, their friendship becomes a lightning rod for school bullies, and is nearly torn apart when Ivy is forced to admit that she isn't a changeling, but an ordinary girl who can't vanquish her real-life enemies. Although I was disappointed that Ivy wasn't truly a changeling, I took comfort in this story, which depicts a girl who uses the idea of magic to realize her creative talent. It's beautiful to see how Ivy's friendship transforms Martha into a shy mouse into a talented actress. If that's not magic, I don't know what is. This book is also beautifully illustrated by Alton Raible. It's lovely to see an illustrator that perfectly captures the spirit of a book. I wish more books had interior illustrations...this seems to becoming a lost art. Thank heavens somebody had the sense to put this book back in print. It's a real gem and deserves your time if you're seeking to make a personal transformation of your own."

Since first making the attempt, I have spent hours staring at the blank screen in front of me, have begun in a hundred different ways - \"Some books aren't books at all, but mirrors...\" \/ \"Zilpha Keatley Snyder may not know it, but she wrote this book about me...\" - but have always ended with the same admission of failure, with the same deletion of whatever facile comments I had typed, whatever little bits of text I had produced - text that had inevitably failed to capture the terrible beauty and power of The Changeling , its strange and elusive appeal, its unshakable hold on me. I am haunted by this book, and although I pride myself on being able to articulate even the most difficult of thoughts and emotions, I find it impossible to say why. Just as it once saved me, this seemingly simple children's novel now defeats me. Again and again. I am too close to it, perhaps... I grew up in a beautiful old house on a hill, with a rundown old carriage house behind it, where my sisters and I were wont to play in younger days. A dreamer, always, I lived in my own world, dividing my time between the pages of whatever book I was devouring, and my imaginary (year-round) outdoor games. Naturally, I had a country of my own - ironically, given my childhood ignorance of the word \"arcane,\" it was named Arcania - with its own intricate history, customs and culture. I spent hours creating the Arcanian language, and crafting its script (sadly, all lost to me today), with its superfluity of vowel forms. Arcania was my retreat and my stronghold, in a world that was beginning - just as I was starting to search for meaning in it - to make no sense, and was as real to me as anything I experienced in my more mundane, \"workday\" life. No author has ever captured - for me - that reality of the imaginary, that power of childhood make-believe, with the same skill as Zilpha Keatly Snyder, in The Changeling . The story of two very different young girls - shy crybaby Martha, so worried about fitting in with her successful family, and wildly idiosyncratic Ivy Carson, daughter of the town's local criminal element - whose friendship is the salvation of both, it perfectly embodies one of the key realities of my own childhood: the role of imagination, and of the internal world, in creating a safe place in a decidedly unsafe existence. Like Ivy and Martha, whose created world was known as Green Sky - a world that Snyder would later use, in creating her brilliant dystopian Green Sky trilogy ( Below the Root , And All Between , Until the Celebration ) - I too enacted a complicated series of rituals and plays surrounding my imagined world. Like them, this had extraordinary meaning for me, and is, to this day, terribly precious to me. One of my favorite works of literature, of ANY kind, The Changeling is a book that has become entwined with my memories of my childhood, to the point that I cannot separate it out. I have lived in this book, as surely as Ivy and Martha did, and while I wouldn't venture to guarantee that it will speak to every young reader as it did (and does) to me, can readily attest to the fact that every word in it is true ."

        "text":"Snyder understands imaginative play and is able to convey the enchanted mood of creative children having their own special world. She has been recognized for doing this in her Newbery Honor book The Egypt Game , but I think it is handled even better in this book. This is a world that does not follow the conventional rules of established games and is kept separate from most grown-ups and children. The fantasy world that Ivy Carson (the self-proclaimed changeling) and her close friend Martha Abbott develop over years, however, is not the only side to this story. A great deal is about real-world activities that hinge upon Ivy's family and how they are received in the town and on how a family name can tar with a broad brush, sometimes unjustly. Both Ivy and Martha are misfits, out of place in their own families, but often swept along by the perceptions and prejudices of others (both within and outside of these families). I suspect that most readers identify with Martha than with Ivy. Hers is the perspective we get on the various happenings of the story (sometimes we get more with the convention of \"Martha heard about it later in bits and pieces\"), and I think this creates an intimacy where we, as readers, understand and sympathize with Martha while everyone else doesn't. Ivy, on the other hand, is a mystery - we know what she tells Martha, but is it true? The story has a timeless feel to some degree, although some specifics of the real-world happenings ground it in a late 1960s to early 1970s timeframe. I think it's set in southern California, like many of Snyder's books (and I think there is a connection to her earlier book The Velvet Room - both make reference to a Montoya family, with an old house surrounded by a fruit orchard). I could see it being rewritten to set it in a different time, but I don't think there is any need to update it to make it relevant for youngsters to whom 1970 is the time of their grandparents. What really matters about this book goes beyond its setting. By and large, the supporting characters are not wooden stereotypes that you know from other books; they behave realistically with their own idiosyncrasies. Only Kelly fits the \"popular mean girl\" mold, but even she is someone you have probably met in your own life, not an exaggeration or a caricature. I especially appreciated the inclusion of Mrs. Smith, an older woman who is nevertheless something of a kindred spirit to the young girls. The book covers a number of years (from Martha in second to tenth grade), and what is particularly unusual about it is how Ivy unexpectedly disappears for long stretches of time, eventually returning just as unexpectedly. In the meantime we continue following Martha, seeing how she reacts to the absence and how she develops on her own. Then we see the two friends reunite, sometimes as if no time had passed, sometimes unsurely. Their fantasy talk and play develops, and I especially liked how it developed in middle school when they reviewed their older activities and \"curated\" them into presentations for younger children. After a bit of a surprise climax, we learn of how Martha matures. We are given a little glimpse of new things in her life that could be big changes. In some ways this feels like a very satisfying wrap up. But then there is yet another final chapter that adds more information and suggests other possibilities. This is another example of how Snyder refuses to give us a conventional cookie-cutter story. In addition to the connections to The Velvet Room and The Egypt Game , there's also a link to Snyder's Green Sky trilogy (beginning with Below the Root ), which is an entirely fantastical tale, developing out of the stories and situations that Ivy and Martha create. I don't think there are prerequisites for reading and enjoying any of these books, but those who have experience with more of Snyder's catalog may be rewarded with additional insights. I have found Madeleine L'Engle to be another author where this is true. Illustrations by Snyder's frequent collaborator Alton Raible are distinctive and add to the mood."

I'm sure, in fact I hope, that she didn't marry Rufus. That she moved to New York City, and became a Broadway actress. Hung out with Andy Warhol, went to Studio 54. In the late 80s, she gave it all up and moved to Vermont, where she opened a small theater that did summer stock. Or maybe an acting school. In her 50s, she's made a comeback on Broadway. Or she's doing voice over work for an animated superhero series. Or she starred in Company as Joanne. Or more likely, she moved to San Francisco, where she had lots of gay friends who died of AIDs in the 80s, became politically active, started an underground theater group, married the guy of her dreams, had some fabulous children, outshone Cath and Tom (who are in their sixties now; her parents are at least in their 80s, probably in their 90s). Ivy became a modern ballet dancer, moved to New York. Or Paris. Had a string of lovers. Flirted with bisexuality. Knew and was known by everyone. Currently writing her memoir, where she will reveal everything. Kelly Peters is fat and lives in Modesto. The Changeling is a really terrific book, and hasn't really grown stale with age. It's still just as poignant as when I first read it, so many years ago."

But then Ivy Carson shows up. The Carsons are not a respectable kind of family, and the father and sons are regularly in trouble with the law. They move often, but just as often return to the dilapidated old family home nearby. But Ivy is nice in a strange sort of away and she has a vivid imagination, even believing herself to be a \"changeling\" (\"I think I might be a wood nymph or water sprite or something like that.\"). And she's just the sort of friend Martha needs. This was a really sweet book about childhood friendship through the years. Not only do we get Martha's perspective of being something of a disappointment to her family, but we eventually get Ivy's frustrations of the way she's treated because of hers. It's one of those middle-grade books that just feels mature and even important - not silly or action-packed - just nice. I was a bit surprised at how casually drug use was discussed at one point in the story, but I guess since the book was written in 1970 the author was trying to be \"hip\" to all that. But other than that weirdness, it was a really nice story."

I think I got it from the Scholastic Book Company when I was in second grade (1971 or 1972); we lived in a very rural area in northern New Mexico and my mother basically allowed me to order every book I wanted when the Scholastic catalog came. I know I then read it many, many times over the years that followed... and then, of course, at some point it got packed away with the rest of my \"kid's books\" and I haven't touched it in ages. But now, as it goes, I'm \"old enough for fairy tales again\" (not that I really ever stopped - I'm not a Gryffindor for nothing), and I found it again when I was recommended other books by Keatley-Snyder. While looking those up, I found \"The Changeling\" again. I knew this book had been very formative for my young mind, I just had forgotten quite how MUCH. I was Martha -- chubby, frightened of everything, burst into tears at the slightest thing; the main difference was I was the oldest child in the family, and, of course, I never had an Ivy. I wanted to be like Martha when I was young, because I was sure I would grow up like she did, tall and slim and loved by everyone... but I never made it THERE. I stayed chubby, but I did end up in all the plays in high school, as a character actor. I made up stories, I wrote them down, I dreamed and wished and never wanted to grow up (and really, that spell DOES work)... I never got thin, but I eventually met my own \"Ivy.\" I didn't meet her early enough to dream with me on that childhood level, but we plan on growing old together, if possibly never grown UP together (because she loved the book, too). I know I don't say a whole lot about the actual book here, but my review is based on feelings and impressions rather than the events in the story. Needless to say, it still holds up just as beautifully as it did then -- sure, now it only took me about two hours to read instead of weeks... but I still lost myself just as deeply within the beautiful lines that Keatley-Snyder wove here. I only wish I could be as brilliant a storyteller (not to say I don't TRY). I still love this book - I love the story, the characters, my feelings and impressions when I read it and how it makes me feel afterward. Beautiful, dreamy, mystic, alien, lost, found, sure of myself, unsure, scared, exhilarated, joyous... everything. Everything. I think this book may have been everything to my growing up. I've never lost it. Know all the questions, but never the answers."

Magic in the story, and in the reshaping of their realities into what they wanted, and needed, them to be, and magic in their friendship. This is a beautiful book about the power of imagination, and female friendship, and those crazy years between being a kid and being a teenager. Martha is every kid who feels like they don't belong and Ivy is the one kid who has never been concerned with belonging. I think Ivy is the kid adults wish they had been... not in such a hurry to grow up, continuing to believe in magic long after most had given it up, and who dreams and runs and dances with joy and without caring what the world thinks. I read this with my 11 year-old daughter and I want those things for her. To have an Ivy or to BE an Ivy. To play and dream and create and to just be a kid, as long as possible."

This has an episodic structure that threatens to be overbearing: the adventures of two imaginative outsiders are charming, evocative, sympathetic, but also frivolous. It's the cumulative effect which matters more, and while Martha's arc is dated (fat reader surrogates are fantastic; fat reader surrogates who lose weight while gaining confidence is problematic) her emotional growth still resonates and the relationship between the girls has sincere chemistry. Ivy is by far the more interesting, dynamic character; Martha is a conservative PoV choice, but Snyder's compassion prevents Ivy's story from becoming a morality lesson and off-centering the most thoughtful parts of the narrative is something I suspect would age well with the reader. I would have liked this more as a younger reader; the restrained, episodic style means there's nothing especially engaging for an incoming adult reader. But I think I would have liked it very much indeed, and still appreciate Snyder's humor and humanity."

My self-imposed “70 from the 70s” project (my third reading project in two years), that I started this past summer, has introduced me to three new writers who have quickly become “top 10” favorites of mine and has also opened the door to several handfuls of riveting “new” reads. Zilpha Keatley Snyder is one of these three “new” writers. Even though Ms. Snyder lived to be almost 90-years-old and wrote FORTY-SIX books between 1964 and 2011, I wasn't familiar with her, until about two years ago, when some Goodreads friends put her on my radar (thank you!). Wow. When I think of how much nonsense I read in my school library while these books lurked in the background. . . As far as I'm concerned, Ms. Snyder's books are right up there with Beverly Cleary's and Judy Blume's. She has a rare gift of turning a middle grades read into a young adult read (there is a strong distinction between these two genres that is often overlooked on here), and an even more rare gift of making all of her reads as appealing to the adult as to the child. I know this may feel like a cryptic reading response, but I'm not sure that I can go any further with this work of fiction without either spoiling it for you or bursting out crying. Let's just say that Ms. Snyder explores class differences and generational poverty here, and when one girl named Ivy can't bear the weight of being made to feel “low class” and “worthless,” she embraces the idea that she is a changeling , a child switched at birth by some enchanted folk. And now I'm a changeling . I'm forever changed by this story."

Two seven year old girls meet and they are from contrasting backgrounds. Martha's family is highly respectable whereas Ivy's family have problems, mum drinks too much, brothers in jail etc. Ivy has an Aunt who sometimes looks after her when things get bad, she sounds lovely, but poor Martha, despite their outward show of respectability, her family ridicule and neglect her and care more about what others think than if Martha is happy. I appreciated this author's awareness that behind the facade of respectability, the wealthy family were awful to their children in other ways. The story focuses on the girls friendship and imaginary play, they spend their time outdoors and make a world of their own. I loved this, and just as this book shows children are pressured into appearing to be grown up and not behaving like children, what could be more natural and healthy than 7yr olds playing imaginary games ? The character of Kelly is a good example in my opinion of what happens to children who don't do this, there is a character like Kelly in most schools unfortunately. The observations of this character were accurate and how true that adults and teachers often are mislead by the chatty, popular, Kellys of this world. We loved the way the girls were so caring to each other, and helped each other stand up to the bullies, how they also cared for animals and tried to help and rescue ones in need of help. This was a 5 star story for us, but although the climax was fitting for the story Kelly says she overheard Martha and Ivy talk about being responsible for a break in at the school, and because she is a favourite she is believed. We felt this was tied up too quickly by her brothers admission and reasons why he did it. Tom's involvement with drugs seemed a sudden addition to the story. The ending was good but it seemed as though several years were condensed into a chapter or two. Ending problems aside this was a beautiful book, and the girls thoughts on the term 'changeling' was an appropriate ending for the story."

Even as a kid I was not much of a reader of realistic fiction, I preferred Fantasy stories. But there were a few exceptions, and I think this would have been one of them, if I'd read it as a young person. Since I've read books by this author before, including another that is realistic fiction, The Velvet Room (which was one of my favorites as a kid), I was not surprised how well she really captures the thoughts and feelings of childhood, the experience from the perspective of a kid, but I was very delighted by it here. This story really captures how magical shared imagination is in childhood with a good friend. The make-believe, the magical thinking - even when knowing it's make believe, the close bond of friendship and how impactful that can be, helping to shape who we grow up to be. For parents: While playing and imagining the girls do mention things about being someone else in a past life, and create make believe spells, etc. If you're particular about that sort of thing, be aware. Also, there are a couple mentions of High School students doing drugs. In one place it's pills (non-specified), in another it's pot. It's not delved into, and doesn't involve the MC, but it is there.

Not surprisingly, I was widely hated by my peers, and sought refuge in books. And while I loved being transported to magical places like Oz and Narnia, I was intensely aware that these books had little bearing on \"real life.\" THE CHANGELING was different. It was about a young girl growing up in a status-conscious family. Her older brother and sister were terribly popular, while her parents were successful and sophisticated. Naturally, Martha feels like an ugly duckling surrounded by swans. Then Ivy Carson comes to town. Ivy's family is utterly disreputable and lets her run wild. Soon, Ivy recruits Martha as her best friend, confiding that she's actually not a Carson, but a changeling -- an child of magical origin who was switched at birth. Soon, the girls are performing witchy ceremonies and create a fantasy realm to which they escape on a regular basis. Not surprisingly, their friendship becomes a lightning rod for school bullies, and is nearly torn apart when Ivy is forced to admit that she isn't a changeling, but an ordinary girl who can't vanquish her real-life enemies. Although I was disappointed that Ivy wasn't truly a changeling, I took comfort in this story, which depicts a girl who uses the idea of magic to realize her creative talent. It's beautiful to see how Ivy's friendship transforms Martha into a shy mouse into a talented actress. If that's not magic, I don't know what is. This book is also beautifully illustrated by Alton Raible. It's lovely to see an illustrator that perfectly captures the spirit of a book. I wish more books had interior illustrations...this seems to becoming a lost art. Thank heavens somebody had the sense to put this book back in print.

Since first making the attempt, I have spent hours staring at the blank screen in front of me, have begun in a hundred different ways - \"Some books aren't books at all, but mirrors...\" \/ \"Zilpha Keatley Snyder may not know it, but she wrote this book about me...\" - but have always ended with the same admission of failure, with the same deletion of whatever facile comments I had typed, whatever little bits of text I had produced - text that had inevitably failed to capture the terrible beauty and power of The Changeling , its strange and elusive appeal, its unshakable hold on me. I am haunted by this book, and although I pride myself on being able to articulate even the most difficult of thoughts and emotions, I find it impossible to say why. Just as it once saved me, this seemingly simple children's novel now defeats me. Again and again. I am too close to it, perhaps... I grew up in a beautiful old house on a hill, with a rundown old carriage house behind it, where my sisters and I were wont to play in younger days. A dreamer, always, I lived in my own world, dividing my time between the pages of whatever book I was devouring, and my imaginary (year-round) outdoor games. Naturally, I had a country of my own - ironically, given my childhood ignorance of the word \"arcane,\" it was named Arcania - with its own intricate history, customs and culture. I spent hours creating the Arcanian language, and crafting its script (sadly, all lost to me today), with its superfluity of vowel forms. Arcania was my retreat and my stronghold, in a world that was beginning - just as I was starting to search for meaning in it - to make no sense, and was as real to me as anything I experienced in my more mundane, \"workday\" life. No author has ever captured - for me - that reality of the imaginary, that power of childhood make-believe, with the same skill as Zilpha Keatly Snyder, in The Changeling . The story of two very different young girls - shy crybaby Martha, so worried about fitting in with her successful family, and wildly idiosyncratic Ivy Carson, daughter of the town's local criminal element - whose friendship is the salvation of both, it perfectly embodies one of the key realities of my own childhood: the role of imagination, and of the internal world, in creating a safe place in a decidedly unsafe existence. Like Ivy and Martha, whose created world was known as Green Sky - a world that Snyder would later use, in creating her brilliant dystopian Green Sky trilogy ( Below the Root , And All Between , Until the Celebration ) - I too enacted a complicated series of rituals and plays surrounding my imagined world. Like them, this had extraordinary meaning for me, and is, to this day, terribly precious to me. One of my favorite works of literature, of ANY kind, The Changeling is a book that has become entwined with my memories of my childhood, to the point that I cannot separate it out. I have lived in this book, as surely as Ivy and Martha did, and while I wouldn't venture to guarantee that it will speak to every young reader as it did (and does) to me, can readily attest to the fact that every word in it is true ."

        "text":"Snyder understands imaginative play and is able to convey the enchanted mood of creative children having their own special world. She has been recognized for doing this in her Newbery Honor book The Egypt Game , but I think it is handled even better in this book. This is a world that does not follow the conventional rules of established games and is kept separate from most grown-ups and children. The fantasy world that Ivy Carson (the self-proclaimed changeling) and her close friend Martha Abbott develop over years, however, is not the only side to this story. A great deal is about real-world activities that hinge upon Ivy's family and how they are received in the town and on how a family name can tar with a broad brush, sometimes unjustly. Both Ivy and Martha are misfits, out of place in their own families, but often swept along by the perceptions and prejudices of others (both within and outside of these families). I suspect that most readers identify with Martha than with Ivy. Hers is the perspective we get on the various happenings of the story (sometimes we get more with the convention of \"Martha heard about it later in bits and pieces\"), and I think this creates an intimacy where we, as readers, understand and sympathize with Martha while everyone else doesn't. Ivy, on the other hand, is a mystery - we know what she tells Martha, but is it true? The story has a timeless feel to some degree, although some specifics of the real-world happenings ground it in a late 1960s to early 1970s timeframe. I think it's set in southern California, like many of Snyder's books (and I think there is a connection to her earlier book The Velvet Room - both make reference to a Montoya family, with an old house surrounded by a fruit orchard). I could see it being rewritten to set it in a different time, but I don't think there is any need to update it to make it relevant for youngsters to whom 1970 is the time of their grandparents. What really matters about this book goes beyond its setting. By and large, the supporting characters are not wooden stereotypes that you know from other books; they behave realistically with their own idiosyncrasies. Only Kelly fits the \"popular mean girl\" mold, but even she is someone you have probably met in your own life, not an exaggeration or a caricature. I especially appreciated the inclusion of Mrs. Smith, an older woman who is nevertheless something of a kindred spirit to the young girls. The book covers a number of years (from Martha in second to tenth grade), and what is particularly unusual about it is how Ivy unexpectedly disappears for long stretches of time, eventually returning just as unexpectedly. In the meantime we continue following Martha, seeing how she reacts to the absence and how she develops on her own. Then we see the two friends reunite, sometimes as if no time had passed, sometimes unsurely. Their fantasy talk and play develops, and I especially liked how it developed in middle school when they reviewed their older activities and \"curated\" them into presentations for younger children. After a bit of a surprise climax, we learn of how Martha matures. We are given a little glimpse of new things in her life that could be big changes. In some ways this feels like a very satisfying wrap up. But then there is yet another final chapter that adds more information and suggests other possibilities. This is another example of how Snyder refuses to give us a conventional cookie-cutter story. In addition to the connections to The Velvet Room and The Egypt Game , there's also a link to Snyder's Green Sky trilogy (beginning with Below the Root ), which is an entirely fantastical tale, developing out of the stories and situations that Ivy and Martha create. I don't think there are prerequisites for reading and enjoying any of these books, but those who have experience with more of Snyder's catalog may be rewarded with additional insights. I have found Madeleine L'Engle to be another author where this is true. Illustrations by Snyder's frequent collaborator Alton Raible are distinctive and add to the mood."

I'm sure, in fact I hope, that she didn't marry Rufus. That she moved to New York City, and became a Broadway actress. Hung out with Andy Warhol, went to Studio 54. In the late 80s, she gave it all up and moved to Vermont, where she opened a small theater that did summer stock. Or maybe an acting school. In her 50s, she's made a comeback on Broadway. Or she's doing voice over work for an animated superhero series. Or she starred in Company as Joanne. Or more likely, she moved to San Francisco, where she had lots of gay friends who died of AIDs in the 80s, became politically active, started an underground theater group, married the guy of her dreams, had some fabulous children, outshone Cath and Tom (who are in their sixties now; her parents are at least in their 80s, probably in their 90s). Ivy became a modern ballet dancer, moved to New York. Or Paris. Had a string of lovers. Flirted with bisexuality. Knew and was known by everyone. Currently writing her memoir, where she will reveal everything. Kelly Peters is fat and lives in Modesto. The Changeling is a really terrific book, and hasn't really grown stale with age. It's still just as poignant as when I first read it, so many years ago."

But then Ivy Carson shows up. The Carsons are not a respectable kind of family, and the father and sons are regularly in trouble with the law. They move often, but just as often return to the dilapidated old family home nearby. But Ivy is nice in a strange sort of away and she has a vivid imagination, even believing herself to be a \"changeling\" (\"I think I might be a wood nymph or water sprite or something like that.\"). And she's just the sort of friend Martha needs. This was a really sweet book about childhood friendship through the years. Not only do we get Martha's perspective of being something of a disappointment to her family, but we eventually get Ivy's frustrations of the way she's treated because of hers. It's one of those middle-grade books that just feels mature and even important - not silly or action-packed - just nice. I was a bit surprised at how casually drug use was discussed at one point in the story, but I guess since the book was written in 1970 the author was trying to be \"hip\" to all that. But other than that weirdness, it was a really nice story."

I think I got it from the Scholastic Book Company when I was in second grade (1971 or 1972); we lived in a very rural area in northern New Mexico and my mother basically allowed me to order every book I wanted when the Scholastic catalog came. I know I then read it many, many times over the years that followed... and then, of course, at some point it got packed away with the rest of my \"kid's books\" and I haven't touched it in ages. But now, as it goes, I'm \"old enough for fairy tales again\" (not that I really ever stopped - I'm not a Gryffindor for nothing), and I found it again when I was recommended other books by Keatley-Snyder. While looking those up, I found \"The Changeling\" again. I knew this book had been very formative for my young mind, I just had forgotten quite how MUCH. I was Martha -- chubby, frightened of everything, burst into tears at the slightest thing; the main difference was I was the oldest child in the family, and, of course, I never had an Ivy. I wanted to be like Martha when I was young, because I was sure I would grow up like she did, tall and slim and loved by everyone... but I never made it THERE. I stayed chubby, but I did end up in all the plays in high school, as a character actor. I made up stories, I wrote them down, I dreamed and wished and never wanted to grow up (and really, that spell DOES work)... I never got thin, but I eventually met my own \"Ivy.\" I didn't meet her early enough to dream with me on that childhood level, but we plan on growing old together, if possibly never grown UP together (because she loved the book, too). I know I don't say a whole lot about the actual book here, but my review is based on feelings and impressions rather than the events in the story. Needless to say, it still holds up just as beautifully as it did then -- sure, now it only took me about two hours to read instead of weeks... but I still lost myself just as deeply within the beautiful lines that Keatley-Snyder wove here. I only wish I could be as brilliant a storyteller (not to say I don't TRY). I still love this book - I love the story, the characters, my feelings and impressions when I read it and how it makes me feel afterward. Beautiful, dreamy, mystic, alien, lost, found, sure of myself, unsure, scared, exhilarated, joyous... everything. Everything. I think this book may have been everything to my growing up. I've never lost it. Know all the questions, but never the answers."

This has an episodic structure that threatens to be overbearing: the adventures of two imaginative outsiders are charming, evocative, sympathetic, but also frivolous. It's the cumulative effect which matters more, and while Martha's arc is dated (fat reader surrogates are fantastic; fat reader surrogates who lose weight while gaining confidence is problematic) her emotional growth still resonates and the relationship between the girls has sincere chemistry. Ivy is by far the more interesting, dynamic character; Martha is a conservative PoV choice, but Snyder's compassion prevents Ivy's story from becoming a morality lesson and off-centering the most thoughtful parts of the narrative is something I suspect would age well with the reader. I would have liked this more as a younger reader; the restrained, episodic style means there's nothing especially engaging for an incoming adult reader. But I think I would have liked it very much indeed, and still appreciate Snyder's humor and humanity."

    "desc":"With three acclaimed novels – Powers That Be, Power Lines, and Power Play – bestselling authors Anne McCaffrey and Elizabeth Ann Scarborough launched a vibrant new science-fiction saga that told the story of a sentient planet, Petaybee, and the humans who fought to protect it from the rapacious designs of an all-powerful interstellar corporation determined to exploit the icy world’s natural resources. Led by Yana Maddock and Sean Shongili, Petaybee’s protectors prevailed. But now Petaybee is changing in mysterious, unprecedented ways, and the return of off-world scientists threatens the amazing planet and its equally amazing inhabitants with new dangers. CHANGELINGS They are Ronan Born for Water Shongili and Murel Monster Slayer Shongili. Twin brother and sister. Children of Yana and Sean. Children of Petaybee. As such, theirs is a destiny deeply intertwined with the sentient planet that is their home. For Ronan and Murel are more than human. Like their father, each can transform into a seal and converse telepathically with the planet’s creatures–such as the friendly otter whose life they save one day from a pack of ravenous wolves. But the twins’ bravery has unforeseen results when a visiting scientist witnesses their startling metamorphosis and becomes obsessed with their capture. To protect their children, Sean and Yana send them to stay with a powerful family friend on an orbiting space station. But no one realizes that Ronan and Murel hunger to discover the origins of their shape-shifting talent–and that their search for knowledge will place them squarely in the path of peril. Meanwhile, Petaybee is changing–and much faster than an ordinary planet’s natural evolution. It appears that portions of the sea are heating up and a landmass is suddenly rising from the depths. To investigate the startling occurrence, Sean heads out to the open water in his seal form. But the newly unstable region holds untold mysteries–and the potential for disaster.",

        "text":"Changelings is the result of a collaboration: Anne McCaffrey (of The Dragonriders of Pern fame) and Elizabeth Ann Scarborough ( The Healer's War ). Although both are fine writers, I found this book less than the talents of either, rather than even just the sum of their abilities. The story takes place on a sentient planet, Petaybee, as seen through the eyes of the Shongilis, one of the many immigrant families that combine Inuit and Irish heritage. The children of Sean and Yana Shongili are twins, Ronan Born for Water, and Murel Monster Slayer. Their father, Sean, is a selkie-to-human changeling, a trait passed on to the twins. Petaybee is itself creating a landmass for the people and animals with which it feels a sense of harmony. Volcanic activity--terraforming--is the process of raising land out of the ocean, much as Michener's Hawaii described for that island. The idea of a planetary consciousness appeals to me in these times, especially that it might get to veto things that would harm it. Yet I found too many sections of the plot predictable, somewhat like a stage play in which the theater-goer sadly finds that each of the props, if there, are certain to figure in the drama. Things are seldom there just for ambiance, mood or the deliciousness of illuminating the setting or a character's choices. And, despite the precocity of the twins, some things are just too pat, too cute. Moreover, to me the writing often seemed unedited. For example, in the Prologue, the word and phrase repetition almost made me quit. Here's the first paragraph: \"Petaybe was changing. It was always changing. The quakes and eruptions, avalanches and slides, great winds on land and sea, even the ebb and flow of the tide, brought about fundamental changes in the planet's surface, in the way it was. The people who lived on Petaybe knew and accepted this. If it had not been for the changes, jump-started and accelerated by a terraforming process begun only a few decades before, no one would have been able to live on Petayabee. The people made songs about the changes, celebrated them.\" Maybe I'm picky. Maybe it's because I'd just come off reading the amazing book Savvy by Ingrid Law, also a fantasy-adventure. Maybe I was having a tough week. But maybe not. I think there is less here than meets the eye. Another story based on a hoary formula."

Repetitive, no action, telling not showing writing style, no emotional investment, dialogue reads like a 4-6-year-olds where they are all about them and have little understanding of what's going on around them but they are put in charge. Oversimplified young child-like writing and reasoning. I couldn't stand any of the characters, they were all very immature but talked big at times with a capacity they should not have had and the adults were just there to point the two main characters in the direction they needed to go next. The kids were the real ones in charge and considering they were 7 then 10 doesn't say much. They had zero growth in personality or thinking\/understanding. Considering where they live, how they were brought up (without consequences for any of their actions and letting them be in charge), and who they\/their parents were this lead to absolute stupidity and silliness that was annoying and eye-rolling inducing rather than funny or cute. There was no real conflict, nothing really happened that was exciting or emotional."

After reading the Petaybee series, I was thrilled to learn that there was also a Twins Of Petaybee series, and having read the first installment, I was not disappointed. The sentient planet now has two more unique residents, Ronan and Murel Shongili, the selkie twins. They and their father Sean can transform into seals when in water, and they use their gifts to explore freely. I enjoyed watching three years of the twins' lives (from age 7-10) and how they had to pick up the fight their parents began to protect Petaybee from the Company who only wants to exploit it. It was also good to see familiar characters like Colonel Yanaba Maddock-Shongili, Sean Shongile, Clodagh and of course Nanook the track cat and Coaxtl the clouded snow leopard. Those two are the only reason why I can't give five stars. Those blasted cats kept changing genders every ten pages! In the previous series, Nanook was established as a black MALE track cat. Coaxtl was a FEMALE snow leopard, and even thought once on how she could tell that Nanook desired her for a mate. When we were reunited with them as babysitters for the infant selkie twins, both of them were male. Then Coaxtl went back to her correct gender and Nanook followed her! By the time the book ended, I didn't know what they were :-). Ah, the perils of writing a series. I also didn't like that Diego Metaxos barely got mentioned, and Bunny Rourke slipped through so fast I almost missed her. I saw a fleeting reference to Bunny's baby- I can only assume that she and Diego got married and this is their offspring because it was never mentioned. When you create a series that captures the imagination, you have to keep up with the folks you teach your readers to love. That notwithstanding, I'm off to read the other two in the trilogy :-)"

        "text":"So, take a set of twins - Ronan Born for Water Shongili, and Mural Monster Slayer Shongili - that can shape change into seals, just like their father, then a sentient planet that is slowly trying to give birth to an island, an Otter that thinks it's cool to be friends with the twins, and a scientist that discovers them, and kidnaps the Otter's family, in the hopes of luring said twins so she can study them! What you end up with, are parents that realise that their, now eight year old, twins have become too adventurous for their own good, but too young to realise the dangers they could face, and so they need to send them off world, into the safe keeping of their friend Marmie, where they could explore somewhere very different to their planet, and while they are young enough to be able to do so. They go with Marmie to her home, a space station, where they meet young children their own age, and learn about other planets in their system. For three years they stay there, becoming good friends with Ke-ola, a boy whose people were originally Island people on Old Earth, but had become like the twins' people, the IP's: the Inconvenient Peoples. Ke-ola's people were moved - more than once - in order that the Company who owned their lands could access whatever minerals were found there. Ke-ola teaches them about his people, and shows them holo's of how beautiful their first home had been, with laughing, dancing people, enjoying the sunny islands with an abundance of all types of plants and flowers. He then shows them the place they had been moved to next - a colder, heavier, world where their life is much harder, and their traditional flora and fauna struggle to survive. Next, they are shown the grim ecobubbles, where his family were living now, and the contrast from their home world couldn't have been more different! At their school, a new teacher arrives, a Professor Mabo, who's grandson, Rory, is one of their school friends. She's not nice to Rory, her family, or the other children, but tries to be friendly with Ronan, ignoring Mural, until, one day in a dissection class, Mabo comes up behind Mural, making her jump, and cut her finger. Ronan sees Mabo take a tissue that has Murals blood on it, and wonders why, only to find out, when the twins try to rescue a Honokuan sea turtle, that Mabo was going to experiment on. It came from the same world as Ke-ola, who joined with the twins in the rescue attempt. Unfortunately, Mabo had known they would try this, and snuck up to the twins, and pushed them into the tank, where they immediately changed into seals. Ke-ola had escaped the room and raced off to get Marmie and her security people, who turned up just in time to rescue the twins. It turned out that Mabo was one of the scientists who had tried to kidnap the twins on Petaybee! In the meantime, on Petaybee, Sean, the twins' father, had gone to look at the volcanic mass that the planet had been slowly extruding in the middle of the ocean, but was caught in a blast that knocked him out. Just as everything was turning black, he sees some moving lights where there shouldn't be any. Marmie takes the twins back to Petaybee, where they learn that Sean is missing. Ke-ola had come with them, as well as the turtle, and they volunteered to go with the twins, to see if Sean could be found. When, with the help of their friend Otter, now named Sky, and his family, and their cousins the sea otters, they find the place of moving lights, where the sea otters tell them there lives deep sea otters and, only after promising these mysterious creatures that they'd keep them a secret, did their father suddenly appear among them, just waking up, and thinking he had only just been knocked out. As their mother, Yana, and their friends Marmie, Johnny, and the crew of the yatch, manage to get them out of the sea, they realise that Petaybee is ready to give birth to so much mass, that they were in danger of being killed. Ke-ola, though, has a plan and, through the history of his people, dances and sings, then gets everyone else to join in with him, and this helps Petaybee to give birth, in a much better, more controlled manner, than she had been doing. She gives birth to an island, one that she planned for Ke-ola, and his family, to live on. I did enjoy this book, and loved most of it, though I couldn't give it the five stars I might have done, because there were times throughout it, that I actually got a little irritated with the tone used. I know it's the story of the twins but, quite frankly, there were sections where I felt we were expected to read it as if we were young children ourselves. This just annoyed me as, although the twins are young, they were born aware, and they were much more forward than their peer group, so using an almost baby-talk kind of tone, felt wrong to me. It didn't match to Anne's usual standards for me."

As they got older, the twins wanted to swim farther and farther away to explore, heedless of the potential danger. When their big cat guardians Coaxtl and Nanook can't keep up, their father suggests they find a swimming buddy for when he can't explore with them. On a search for friends, they rescue an otter who was trapped in the ice. When they went to visit his home, they found wolves attacking. Ronan and Murel tried to run them off, but needed to be rescued themselves. Fortunately Coaxtl and Nanook called for help when they lost their young charges, and brought back Sean and his sister Sinead at the head of a rescue party. After the wolf incident closely followed by some scientists who illegally came to Petaybee to capture animals to experiment on, Sean and Yana sent the twins with their friend Marmion de Revers Algemaine to stay on the space station where she lived to keep them away from those scientists. Unfortunately, one of the scientists had seen the twins change shape, and when she learned where they were, got a teaching assignment on the space station. One of their classmates was Ke'ola, who like themselves comes from a people displaced from Earth and forced onto a desolate world. Unlike the Petaybeans, Ke'ola's Hawaiian people kept getting shuffled from harsh world to harsh world, seemingly with no end in sight. Once the twins were rescued from the scientist's bad intentions, they invited Ke'ola and the sea turtle his people considered a totem animal to visit Petaybee. I enjoyed this first of a trilogy featuring the twins and I'm looking forward to seeing more"

I thought the two humans on the cover were the twins; if that was the case, they're much, much younger in the book than portrayed on the cover. I suspect perhaps those were supposed to be their parents instead? I know \"never judge a book by its cover\" but first impressions are important and I certainly was expecting a pair of adult twins. There was also a few typos involving whether the big cats - Coaxtl and Nanook - were male or female (the first few chapters kept switching it around until the authors seemed to settle on female) and that sort of shoddy lack of attention to detail rankles me. If I, who had never read it, caught it immediately, what was their editor doing? Maybe this is addressed in a later edition; the one I read was the first edition, printed in 2006. However, it caught me up enough that I'm interested in what happens to the kids in the second book."

At no point did they actually come across as the age they were supposed to be and acted more like stroppy teenagers. The start of the novel, with the twins being introduced to Petaybee and them growing up, was interesting, but felt like one long prologue. The middle section, with them living on the space station, was just a bit tedious and even their 'kidnapping' was boring in that you could see it coming a million miles away. But the last third of the novel definitely lifted it back to the status of the first, with everyone caught up with Petaybee's birthing of a new land mass.

        "text":"Changelings is the result of a collaboration: Anne McCaffrey (of The Dragonriders of Pern fame) and Elizabeth Ann Scarborough ( The Healer's War ). Although both are fine writers, I found this book less than the talents of either, rather than even just the sum of their abilities. The story takes place on a sentient planet, Petaybee, as seen through the eyes of the Shongilis, one of the many immigrant families that combine Inuit and Irish heritage. The children of Sean and Yana Shongili are twins, Ronan Born for Water, and Murel Monster Slayer. Their father, Sean, is a selkie-to-human changeling, a trait passed on to the twins. Petaybee is itself creating a landmass for the people and animals with which it feels a sense of harmony. Volcanic activity--terraforming--is the process of raising land out of the ocean, much as Michener's Hawaii described for that island. The idea of a planetary consciousness appeals to me in these times, especially that it might get to veto things that would harm it. Yet I found too many sections of the plot predictable, somewhat like a stage play in which the theater-goer sadly finds that each of the props, if there, are certain to figure in the drama. Things are seldom there just for ambiance, mood or the deliciousness of illuminating the setting or a character's choices. And, despite the precocity of the twins, some things are just too pat, too cute. Moreover, to me the writing often seemed unedited. For example, in the Prologue, the word and phrase repetition almost made me quit. Here's the first paragraph: \"Petaybe was changing. It was always changing. The quakes and eruptions, avalanches and slides, great winds on land and sea, even the ebb and flow of the tide, brought about fundamental changes in the planet's surface, in the way it was. The people who lived on Petaybe knew and accepted this. If it had not been for the changes, jump-started and accelerated by a terraforming process begun only a few decades before, no one would have been able to live on Petayabee. The people made songs about the changes, celebrated them.\" Maybe I'm picky. Maybe it's because I'd just come off reading the amazing book Savvy by Ingrid Law, also a fantasy-adventure. Maybe I was having a tough week. But maybe not. I think there is less here than meets the eye. Another story based on a hoary formula."

I couldn't stand any of the characters, they were all very immature but talked big at times with a capacity they should not have had and the adults were just there to point the two main characters in the direction they needed to go next. The kids were the real ones in charge and considering they were 7 then 10 doesn't say much. They had zero growth in personality or thinking\/understanding. Considering where they live, how they were brought up (without consequences for any of their actions and letting them be in charge), and who they\/their parents were this lead to absolute stupidity and silliness that was annoying and eye-rolling inducing rather than funny or cute.

They and their father Sean can transform into seals when in water, and they use their gifts to explore freely.

Ke-ola had escaped the room and raced off to get Marmie and her security people, who turned up just in time to rescue the twins. It turned out that Mabo was one of the scientists who had tried to kidnap the twins on Petaybee! In the meantime, on Petaybee, Sean, the twins' father, had gone to look at the volcanic mass that the planet had been slowly extruding in the middle of the ocean, but was caught in a blast that knocked him out. Just as everything was turning black, he sees some moving lights where there shouldn't be any. Marmie takes the twins back to Petaybee, where they learn that Sean is missing. Ke-ola had come with them, as well as the turtle, and they volunteered to go with the twins, to see if Sean could be found. When, with the help of their friend Otter, now named Sky, and his family, and their cousins the sea otters, they find the place of moving lights, where the sea otters tell them there lives deep sea otters and, only after promising these mysterious creatures that they'd keep them a secret, did their father suddenly appear among them, just waking up, and thinking he had only just been knocked out. As their mother, Yana, and their friends Marmie, Johnny, and the crew of the yatch, manage to get them out of the sea, they realise that Petaybee is ready to give birth to so much mass, that they were in danger of being killed. Ke-ola, though, has a plan and, through the history of his people, dances and sings, then gets everyone else to join in with him, and this helps Petaybee to give birth, in a much better, more controlled manner, than she had been doing. She gives birth to an island, one that she planned for Ke-ola, and his family, to live on. I did enjoy this book, and loved most of it, though I couldn't give it the five stars I might have done, because there were times throughout it, that I actually got a little irritated with the tone used. I know it's the story of the twins but, quite frankly, there were sections where I felt we were expected to read it as if we were young children ourselves. This just annoyed me as, although the twins are young, they were born aware, and they were much more forward than their peer group, so using an almost baby-talk kind of tone, felt wrong to me. It didn't match to Anne's usual standards for me."

As they got older, the twins wanted to swim farther and farther away to explore, heedless of the potential danger. When their big cat guardians Coaxtl and Nanook can't keep up, their father suggests they find a swimming buddy for when he can't explore with them. On a search for friends, they rescue an otter who was trapped in the ice. When they went to visit his home, they found wolves attacking. Ronan and Murel tried to run them off, but needed to be rescued themselves. Fortunately Coaxtl and Nanook called for help when they lost their young charges, and brought back Sean and his sister Sinead at the head of a rescue party. After the wolf incident closely followed by some scientists who illegally came to Petaybee to capture animals to experiment on, Sean and Yana sent the twins with their friend Marmion de Revers Algemaine to stay on the space station where she lived to keep them away from those scientists. Unfortunately, one of the scientists had seen the twins change shape, and when she learned where they were, got a teaching assignment on the space station. One of their classmates was Ke'ola, who like themselves comes from a people displaced from Earth and forced onto a desolate world. Unlike the Petaybeans, Ke'ola's Hawaiian people kept getting shuffled from harsh world to harsh world, seemingly with no end in sight. Once the twins were rescued from the scientist's bad intentions, they invited Ke'ola and the sea turtle his people considered a totem animal to visit Petaybee. I enjoyed this first of a trilogy featuring the twins and I'm looking forward to seeing more"

I thought the two humans on the cover were the twins; if that was the case, they're much, much younger in the book than portrayed on the cover. I suspect perhaps those were supposed to be their parents instead? I know \"never judge a book by its cover\" but first impressions are important and I certainly was expecting a pair of adult twins. There was also a few typos involving whether the big cats - Coaxtl and Nanook - were male or female (the first few chapters kept switching it around until the authors seemed to settle on female) and that sort of shoddy lack of attention to detail rankles me. If I, who had never read it, caught it immediately, what was their editor doing? Maybe this is addressed in a later edition; the one I read was the first edition, printed in 2006. However, it caught me up enough that I'm interested in what happens to the kids in the second book."

At no point did they actually come across as the age they were supposed to be and acted more like stroppy teenagers. The start of the novel, with the twins being introduced to Petaybee and them growing up, was interesting, but felt like one long prologue. The middle section, with them living on the space station, was just a bit tedious and even their 'kidnapping' was boring in that you could see it coming a million miles away. But the last third of the novel definitely lifted it back to the status of the first, with everyone caught up with Petaybee's birthing of a new land mass. A decent enough read and entertaining enough to keep the pages turning."

        "text":"Changelings is the result of a collaboration: Anne McCaffrey (of The Dragonriders of Pern fame) and Elizabeth Ann Scarborough ( The Healer's War ). Although both are fine writers, I found this book less than the talents of either, rather than even just the sum of their abilities. The story takes place on a sentient planet, Petaybee, as seen through the eyes of the Shongilis, one of the many immigrant families that combine Inuit and Irish heritage. The children of Sean and Yana Shongili are twins, Ronan Born for Water, and Murel Monster Slayer. Their father, Sean, is a selkie-to-human changeling, a trait passed on to the twins. Petaybee is itself creating a landmass for the people and animals with which it feels a sense of harmony. Volcanic activity--terraforming--is the process of raising land out of the ocean, much as Michener's Hawaii described for that island. The idea of a planetary consciousness appeals to me in these times, especially that it might get to veto things that would harm it. Yet I found too many sections of the plot predictable, somewhat like a stage play in which the theater-goer sadly finds that each of the props, if there, are certain to figure in the drama. Things are seldom there just for ambiance, mood or the deliciousness of illuminating the setting or a character's choices. And, despite the precocity of the twins, some things are just too pat, too cute. Moreover, to me the writing often seemed unedited. For example, in the Prologue, the word and phrase repetition almost made me quit. Here's the first paragraph: \"Petaybe was changing. It was always changing. The quakes and eruptions, avalanches and slides, great winds on land and sea, even the ebb and flow of the tide, brought about fundamental changes in the planet's surface, in the way it was. The people who lived on Petaybe knew and accepted this. If it had not been for the changes, jump-started and accelerated by a terraforming process begun only a few decades before, no one would have been able to live on Petayabee. The people made songs about the changes, celebrated them.\" Maybe I'm picky. Maybe it's because I'd just come off reading the amazing book Savvy by Ingrid Law, also a fantasy-adventure. Maybe I was having a tough week. But maybe not. I think there is less here than meets the eye. Another story based on a hoary formula."

Oversimplified young child-like writing and reasoning. I couldn't stand any of the characters, they were all very immature but talked big at times with a capacity they should not have had and the adults were just there to point the two main characters in the direction they needed to go next. The kids were the real ones in charge and considering they were 7 then 10 doesn't say much. They had zero growth in personality or thinking\/understanding. Considering where they live, how they were brought up (without consequences for any of their actions and letting them be in charge), and who they\/their parents were this lead to absolute stupidity and silliness that was annoying and eye-rolling inducing rather than funny or cute.

After reading the Petaybee series, I was thrilled to learn that there was also a Twins Of Petaybee series, and having read the first installment, I was not disappointed. The sentient planet now has two more unique residents, Ronan and Murel Shongili, the selkie twins. They and their father Sean can transform into seals when in water, and they use their gifts to explore freely. I enjoyed watching three years of the twins' lives (from age 7-10) and how they had to pick up the fight their parents began to protect Petaybee from the Company who only wants to exploit it. It was also good to see familiar characters like Colonel Yanaba Maddock-Shongili, Sean Shongile, Clodagh and of course Nanook the track cat and Coaxtl the clouded snow leopard. Those two are the only reason why I can't give five stars. Those blasted cats kept changing genders every ten pages! In the previous series, Nanook was established as a black MALE track cat. Coaxtl was a FEMALE snow leopard, and even thought once on how she could tell that Nanook desired her for a mate. When we were reunited with them as babysitters for the infant selkie twins, both of them were male. Then Coaxtl went back to her correct gender and Nanook followed her! By the time the book ended, I didn't know what they were :-). Ah, the perils of writing a series. I also didn't like that Diego Metaxos barely got mentioned, and Bunny Rourke slipped through so fast I almost missed her. I saw a fleeting reference to Bunny's baby- I can only assume that she and Diego got married and this is their offspring because it was never mentioned. When you create a series that captures the imagination, you have to keep up with the folks you teach your readers to love. That notwithstanding, I'm off to read the other two in the trilogy :-)"

What you end up with, are parents that realise that their, now eight year old, twins have become too adventurous for their own good, but too young to realise the dangers they could face, and so they need to send them off world, into the safe keeping of their friend Marmie, where they could explore somewhere very different to their planet, and while they are young enough to be able to do so. They go with Marmie to her home, a space station, where they meet young children their own age, and learn about other planets in their system. For three years they stay there, becoming good friends with Ke-ola, a boy whose people were originally Island people on Old Earth, but had become like the twins' people, the IP's: the Inconvenient Peoples. Ke-ola's people were moved - more than once - in order that the Company who owned their lands could access whatever minerals were found there. Ke-ola teaches them about his people, and shows them holo's of how beautiful their first home had been, with laughing, dancing people, enjoying the sunny islands with an abundance of all types of plants and flowers. He then shows them the place they had been moved to next - a colder, heavier, world where their life is much harder, and their traditional flora and fauna struggle to survive. Next, they are shown the grim ecobubbles, where his family were living now, and the contrast from their home world couldn't have been more different! At their school, a new teacher arrives, a Professor Mabo, who's grandson, Rory, is one of their school friends. She's not nice to Rory, her family, or the other children, but tries to be friendly with Ronan, ignoring Mural, until, one day in a dissection class, Mabo comes up behind Mural, making her jump, and cut her finger. Ronan sees Mabo take a tissue that has Murals blood on it, and wonders why, only to find out, when the twins try to rescue a Honokuan sea turtle, that Mabo was going to experiment on. It came from the same world as Ke-ola, who joined with the twins in the rescue attempt. Unfortunately, Mabo had known they would try this, and snuck up to the twins, and pushed them into the tank, where they immediately changed into seals. Ke-ola had escaped the room and raced off to get Marmie and her security people, who turned up just in time to rescue the twins. It turned out that Mabo was one of the scientists who had tried to kidnap the twins on Petaybee! In the meantime, on Petaybee, Sean, the twins' father, had gone to look at the volcanic mass that the planet had been slowly extruding in the middle of the ocean, but was caught in a blast that knocked him out. Just as everything was turning black, he sees some moving lights where there shouldn't be any. Marmie takes the twins back to Petaybee, where they learn that Sean is missing. Ke-ola had come with them, as well as the turtle, and they volunteered to go with the twins, to see if Sean could be found. When, with the help of their friend Otter, now named Sky, and his family, and their cousins the sea otters, they find the place of moving lights, where the sea otters tell them there lives deep sea otters and, only after promising these mysterious creatures that they'd keep them a secret, did their father suddenly appear among them, just waking up, and thinking he had only just been knocked out. As their mother, Yana, and their friends Marmie, Johnny, and the crew of the yatch, manage to get them out of the sea, they realise that Petaybee is ready to give birth to so much mass, that they were in danger of being killed. Ke-ola, though, has a plan and, through the history of his people, dances and sings, then gets everyone else to join in with him, and this helps Petaybee to give birth, in a much better, more controlled manner, than she had been doing. She gives birth to an island, one that she planned for Ke-ola, and his family, to live on. I did enjoy this book, and loved most of it, though I couldn't give it the five stars I might have done, because there were times throughout it, that I actually got a little irritated with the tone used.

I thought the two humans on the cover were the twins; if that was the case, they're much, much younger in the book than portrayed on the cover. I suspect perhaps those were supposed to be their parents instead? I know \"never judge a book by its cover\" but first impressions are important and I certainly was expecting a pair of adult twins. There was also a few typos involving whether the big cats - Coaxtl and Nanook - were male or female (the first few chapters kept switching it around until the authors seemed to settle on female) and that sort of shoddy lack of attention to detail rankles me. If I, who had never read it, caught it immediately, what was their editor doing? Maybe this is addressed in a later edition; the one I read was the first edition, printed in 2006. However, it caught me up enough that I'm interested in what happens to the kids in the second book."

At no point did they actually come across as the age they were supposed to be and acted more like stroppy teenagers. The start of the novel, with the twins being introduced to Petaybee and them growing up, was interesting, but felt like one long prologue. The middle section, with them living on the space station, was just a bit tedious and even their 'kidnapping' was boring in that you could see it coming a million miles away. But the last third of the novel definitely lifted it back to the status of the first, with everyone caught up with Petaybee's birthing of a new land mass. A decent enough read and entertaining enough to keep the pages turning."

    "desc":"Here, the author of the acclaimed Confessions of a Pagan Nun takes us to fourteenth-century Ireland for a strange and luminous tale of the elusive nature of identity and of triumph in adversity. The Changeling is the story of Grey, a peasant girl who is raised as a boy, and who, until adolescence, never doubts herself to be male. The revelation of her womanhood marks the beginning of her journey through a succession of changing identities—including son, wife, warrior, and mother—each of which brings its own special wisdom, but none of which, she discovers, can ultimately define her. In the course of her adventurous life, Grey deals with all the challenges of her tumultuous age—from political oppression to corrupt Church hierarchy to the horrors of the Black Death—ultimately finding peace and a kind of redemption by embracing the beautifully impermanent quality of identity that her unusual life has enabled her to understand. (Previously published in hardcover as The Changeling of Finnistuath .)",

Still, it's written very well, almost poetic. Gregory, who becomes known as Grey, is raised as a boy. Despite the onset of puberty she never realizes she is female, until one particular incident in her young life. This leads her on quite a journey, of which I will divulge nothing. No spoilers here! The main characters all seem to be dealing with a crisis of faith, whether it be in their religion, the Pope, the fairies, or themselves. Despite her bizarre life, Grey seems to be the only one who has a grip on herself. Until the end, when her life once again changes."

Through shame the girl grows up the pride of her father, and the secret of her mother, only to be pushed finally in the direction of the church. Unfortunatly nature has it's own way of revealing her \"flaws,\" while she is in seminary to become a holy man.

I remembered liking it, so thought I would re-read. I suppose that a more seasoned reading palate and some years of life experience have effected my response to this book. The story starts out well enough with a very interesting scenario, and set in a great time period. Sadly, I became less enchanted by the book this second time around. The narrative is very involved, it felt like it took forever to read. There are long passages that follow the thoughts and actions of several side characters, a midwife, lord's son etc. This was somewhat interesting, but seemed overdone and tiresome after a bit. SPOILERS TO FOLLOW The worst part for me was as the story is nearing the end. Whereas time is rather crawling for the characters throughout the body of the book, towards the end years leap ahead in a few pages. Suddenly Grey is older, her son ages to sexual maturity and is quickly killed... I don't know, I just felt like this \"older\" personification of Grey didn't fit with the character I had been reading about through the majority of the book. Then the passages of her lengthy mourning and nomadic lifestyle vaguely described, I felt like the book kept going on and on when it could have ended chapters earlier with more satisfaction. This may be interesting for a one time read, but definitely not a keeper for me."

It did not affirm a belief in the general goodness of humanity. There was little hope, redemption, or graces but there was a strength - the strength of one woman - that inspired me in ways I don't even know how to articulate. This is an important book.

The character of Grey is one that will linger with me - her strength through unimaginable circumstance...it was just breathtaking. This book did not make me feel good. It did not affirm a belief in the general goodness of humanity. There was little hope, redemption, or graces but there was a strength - the strength of one woman - that inspired me in ways I don't even know how to articulate. This is an important book. It's about identity and perseverance. And, if nothing else, it bathes simple, ugly things, in a language that takes it from ordinary to extraordinary."

Grey is probably 12 or 13 at that point in the book, and reading shit like \"a moan dribbled past his lips\" and how he begged an adult to have sex with him was.....how to put this....fucking nasty regardless of the historical context.

However, Grey turns out to be a girl and realizes the ways of the world are unjust for many, not just girls. This book takes you through Grey's life from boy, to woman, to a woman with a boy. When she finally identifies herself as a mother, she finds a contentment that she has been unable to obtain most of her life. When she is no longer a mother, not only does her heart break but the reader's heart breaks with the truth of the unfairness of the world in which we still live; a world in where a mother's grief exceeds all others."

Horsley uses language that paints a vivid, dark, gorgeously hurtful picture of life in the fourteenth century. The character of Grey is one that will linger with me - her strength through unimaginable circumstance...it was just breathtaking. This book did not make me feel good. It did not affirm a belief in the general goodness of humanity. There was little hope, redemption, or graces but there was a strength - the strength of one woman - that inspired me in ways I don't even know how to articulate. This is an important book. It's about identity and perseverance. And, if nothing else, it bathes simple, ugly things, in a language that takes it from ordinary to extraordinary."

Grey, the protagonist, is such an interesting character, first being raised to believe she was a boy, then finding forbidden love, eventually becoming mother, wife, and warrior. I would have loved to have been more inside Grey's (what must have been) tumultuous mind.

The only reason I'm giving this 4 and not 5 stars (though I'd probably give it 4.5 if I could instead) is that sometimes the writing feels a bit self conscious and contrived (as with other books of hers I've read).

So when she finds herself unemployed and on the outs after a standard bust goes bad resulting in a bloodbath, she welcomes the occasion to break from routine. She scrapes together enough capital to start her own PI business specializing in \"family problems.\" But, in doing so she never guessed that she would uncover her own mysterious and mystical past. When GiGi becomes involved in the case of a missing wife and child, she initially dismisses the matter as good sense on the wife's part--she knows the husband to be less than stellar in his role. But, as her investigation progresses GiGi discovers a pattern of lies and deceptions, some of which expose hidden ties to her own mystifying existence. Otherworldly powers try to intercede, and soon GiGi finds not only her own life threatened, but those of her friends and family as well.",

Even Gwen's character it felt like it was all about the cases she had going and did not delve too much into her emotional makeup and there were often convenient interruptions with her phone ringing and her casual romantic involvements with just about every man she meets is starting to grate.

The author took already strong characters and dialogs to the next level, focusing on what's good about the previous book. However, even though she focused on the fantasy a bit more in the sequel, it's still no more than an allegory. The rushed ending, even though a bit prolonged here in comparison to the Shadows in the Darkness, is still strongly felt once you reached it. Aside from that, this book does not introduce any interesting characters, and one new fantasy element was weakly explored and IMHO not resolved in a satisfactory way - but that's just a feeling and does not necessarily reduce the quality of the work itself."

    "desc":"Rebecca Mandeville The story of The Changeling is told by Angelet's daughter, Rebecca, who was born in Benedict Lansdon's grandfather's house in an Australian gold-mining township. Before Rebecca was born, her father had died saving another man's life. She had always looked up to him as a great hero and when she heard that her mother was to marry Benedict Lansdon, she was deeply shocked. The prolific British author of historical romances ( The Pool of St. Branok ) continues her lavishly entwined narrative of the families connected to Benedict Lansdon, now a recently bereaved widower, absentee father and wealthy seeker of a Parliament seat. Narrated by Benedict's aggrieved stepdaughter, Rebecca, this complex tale of love and betrayal concerns a three-cornered sibling relationship involving Rebecca, her half-sister, Belinda, and Lucie, a country waif informally adopted by Rebecca. Aware that her father blames her for her mother's death in childbirth, Belinda takes refuge in michievous behavior. Placid Lucie, however, fits in well with the family, though her lineage is suspect and clouded with mysterious events at St. Branok's pool. Although Belinda seems the most obvious \"changeling\", Carr sustains an air of doubt and intrigue. The ambience of the Cornish countryside and of Victorian London permeate this piquantly Gothic family saga.",

        "text":"Fifteenth in the Daughters of England historical fiction series in the gothic romance vein. The focus in this one is on a Victorian-era daughter, Rebecca Mandeville and her family. My Take A typical gothic romance with cozy overtones that thwart Carr's attempts to create tension and drama. I'm not sure if my frustration with this is due to how long ago this story was first released and the silly tropes used in this were typical of the writing styles when this was written or if this was an aberration. I know I liked Victoria Holt, one of Carr's pseudonym's, when I was a kid. That said, the protagonist, Rebecca, annoyed the hell out of me. She's such a snot. Granted, she has reason for her unhappiness, but even as she grows, she doesn't acknowledge how unfair she's been, although she's quite keen to disparage others for doing exactly what she's doing. She is so incredibly clueless… And I thought this was the Victorian era when single women couldn't go anywhere unattended? Rebecca goes EVERYwhere unattended. Including into some very dubious establishments. What is Rebecca, or should I say, what is Carr thinking? I'm confused. If Angelet and her husband went to Australia to make it big and come back to England to live in comfort, how has she managed her current comfort if he died there? Then there's Benedict's marriage to Celeste. Supposedly he needs a wife who can hostess dinners, etc. for this upcoming and brilliant politician. And she can barely speak English. How does this make her an asset? That penultimate scene between Pedrek and her…MAJOR eye roll there. I mean, duhhhh, all, and I mean ALL, the evidence is right in front of her and she's too stupid to make the connections??? Give. Me. A. Break. I thought she was supposed to be intelligent. The scene with Jacque-Philip at Tor Hill? Puh-lease. How naive can she be? Personally, I'd've leaped to the conclusion that the attacker was him way before anyone else! Tragedy, drama, whining, the stupid trope, it's all here. The ending was happy enough, and much too easy. The Story It’s so romantic that Angelet and Benedict are free to marry each other, having been childhood sweethearts separated by events. They’re so incredibly happy with only one fly in the ointment: Rebecca hates her new stepfather for taking the place of the father she never knew. When Angelet becomes pregnant, Rebecca looks forward to her new brother or sister arriving. What no one anticipates is how hard the birth is. And Benedict is like Sir Ronald, unforgiving. It’s a pair they are, two people hating in a family with a newborn. A few years later, disaster strikes at Christmas, and Lucie loses her mother tragically. Luckily, Rebecca and her grandparents are kindly people and take Lucie in. Lucky in so many ways… The Characters Rebecca is Angelet's beloved daughter. Angelet Mandeville lost her husband during a rescue attempt in Australia. Now she lives in London with her daughter and visits her grandparents often at Cador, their house in Cornwall. Miss Brown is Rebecca's governess. Mr. and Mrs. Emery are the handyman and housekeeper\/cook in the London house; they'll be elevated to butler and housekeeper when they move to Manorleigh The maids, Jane and Ann , will move as well. Mrs. Grant is the cook hired for Manorleigh. Alfred is a footman in the London house. The baby is Belinda Mary , and Leah will become her nurse. Jim Fedder is a groom in the Manorleigh stables. Miss Stringer is Belinda and Lucie's governess. Miss Martha is the daughter who survived her mother's, Lady Flamstead 's death. Sir Ronald never forgave her. Cador in Cornwall Rolf is Becca's grandfather; Annora is her grandmother. Jack is Angelet's brother; he and his wife, Marian , will inherit Cador when their parents die. They have two children, twins: Jacco and Anne-Mary . Mrs. Garnett is the cook at Cador. Jim Isaacs and Stubbs are two of the grooms. Dr. Wilmington is the family doctor. Madge is a new kitchen maid with a loose tongue. Pedrek Cartwright is Rebecca's best friend — they were born in the same house out in Australia. His grandparents, Josiah Pencarron and his wife, own a mine near Rebecca's grandparents' home in Cornwall. Justin and Morwenna Cartwright are Pedrek's parents who live in London. Benedict Lansdon is the grandson of \"Uncle\" Peter , a great friend of Rebecca's family. Amaryllis is Peter's wife. Peterkin is their son, and he works with his wife, Frances , at the Mission his father established. Helena is Peter and Amaryliss' daughter and is married to a politician, Martin Hume . I'm not sure where Grace Hume fits in, other than she's worked closely with Benedict at some point besides working at the Mission. The wealthy Lizzie Morley was Benedict's first wife. Celeste Bourdon will become his third. Yvette is her lady's maid. Oliver Gerson is a charming business colleague of Benedict's whom he inherited when Uncle Peter's businesses came to him. Tom Marner is an Australian mine owner and colleague who visits Benedict at Manorleigh. In Cornwall Jenny Stubbs is a young woman who lost a child she cared for and so lost a bit of her mind as well. She becomes pregnant with Lucie . She works for the kindly Mrs. Bullet and, I guess, Mrs. Granger . Mrs. Polhenny is an excellent midwife and vituperative religious nut job. Leah is her much-abused daughter who does beautiful embroidery. The Bourdons are French émigrés who will buy High Tor . Celeste is the daughter; the licentious Jean Pascal is the son. The Stennings are the latest tenants of High Tor. Madame Perrotte is teaching Rebecca to curtsy for her presentation. Jack Kellaway worked for Josiah and was injured in a mining accident. A tragedy left his wife, Mary , and daughter, Mary , alone. The Cover The cover is gothic enough with its woods and the tightly buttoned-up Rebecca sitting on the stone bench with her letter and the mysterious gentleman in the background. With all that orange on the ground, I’m tempted to say it’s autumn, but the trees still have their leaves. The title is where it ends up, with The Changeling . A rather obvious one."

This book has everything: deaths, ghosts, babies switched at birth, ravishments in old castles . . . and yet it's all very demurely done. I liked that quite a bit, it was very reminiscent of something like Wuthering Heights or Jane Eyre. Affairs and other scandalous matters were spoken of with veiled comments and euphemisms that were in keeping with the time period. The mysteries (there are a couple) are well done, as are the romances (there are a couple of those, too)."

Instead it is a stereotypical romance novel that just happens to be set in Victorian England. The author dropped a couple of names (Disraeli and Gladstone)and describes the Queen (in passing) as \"a diminutive figure with an expression of gloom and an air of aloofness which was rather disconcerting.\" But this was not enough to truly leave the reader with a sense of the time or place in which the story was set. Mystery? No mystery here. Read the title. Story? Read the jacket fly leaf and save yourself time. If you really like Harlequin Romances, you will probably like The Changeling.

        "text":"“The Changeling” is a refreshing change after the continual use of repeated themes in the past few books in the Daughters of England series. We don’t get the adulterous affairs, and the love story – which is usually the focal point – is a subplot. Family relationships are more prominent in this novel, largely owing to the main character Rebecca being a child when the story opens. One thing this author was very good at was creating child characters, and Lucie & Belinda are believable and vivid, as is the young Rebecca. I like these three characters and Oliver the most. This author, including her works as Victoria Holt, has a tendency to have her heroines refer to one of the male characters by both names, which really irritates me. This novel has several characters referred to by both names, as shown is the quoted dialogue exchange below: “Oh … ups and downs,” said Justin Cartwright. “I am sure you know as much about the mining world as I do … only I suppose tin isn’t gold.” “There must be a difference,” said Benedict Lansdon. “But my close connection with all that ended long ago.” “Ah, yes, of course,” replied Justin Cartwright. “I’m going into politics again,” said Benedict Lansdon, looking at my mother. Most annoying of all is the number of times Oliver Gerson is referred to by his full name. No other character’s first name is Oliver, & no other character’s surname is Gerson, so why not call him by one title or the other? Really bugs me! Another of this author's annoying traits is the overuse of reported speech: >“How did the wedding go?” I told them that all had gone according to plan.< Reported speech is passive. Why not make it active by changing it to dialogue? A few times, the author ruins the suspense with lines like these: >It was a happy Christmas, even for me … the last I was to know for a long time.< While lines of this type often make for good novel openers, they fall flat when inserted halfway through a story. It robs all suspense because you know for certain that something will happen. Also, the author provides her own spoiler with the book’s title. Without giving anything away, the revelation at the end is no surprise to the reader. Despite the above criticisms, I like the change in direction in this novel compared to its predecessors, and enjoyed it in the most part."

        "text":"Fifteenth in the Daughters of England historical fiction series in the gothic romance vein. The focus in this one is on a Victorian-era daughter, Rebecca Mandeville and her family. My Take A typical gothic romance with cozy overtones that thwart Carr's attempts to create tension and drama. I'm not sure if my frustration with this is due to how long ago this story was first released and the silly tropes used in this were typical of the writing styles when this was written or if this was an aberration. I know I liked Victoria Holt, one of Carr's pseudonym's, when I was a kid. That said, the protagonist, Rebecca, annoyed the hell out of me. She's such a snot. Granted, she has reason for her unhappiness, but even as she grows, she doesn't acknowledge how unfair she's been, although she's quite keen to disparage others for doing exactly what she's doing. She is so incredibly clueless… And I thought this was the Victorian era when single women couldn't go anywhere unattended? Rebecca goes EVERYwhere unattended. Including into some very dubious establishments. What is Rebecca, or should I say, what is Carr thinking? I'm confused. If Angelet and her husband went to Australia to make it big and come back to England to live in comfort, how has she managed her current comfort if he died there? Then there's Benedict's marriage to Celeste. Supposedly he needs a wife who can hostess dinners, etc. for this upcoming and brilliant politician. And she can barely speak English. How does this make her an asset? That penultimate scene between Pedrek and her…MAJOR eye roll there. I mean, duhhhh, all, and I mean ALL, the evidence is right in front of her and she's too stupid to make the connections??? Give. Me. A. Break. I thought she was supposed to be intelligent. The scene with Jacque-Philip at Tor Hill? Puh-lease. How naive can she be? Personally, I'd've leaped to the conclusion that the attacker was him way before anyone else! Tragedy, drama, whining, the stupid trope, it's all here. The ending was happy enough, and much too easy. The Story It’s so romantic that Angelet and Benedict are free to marry each other, having been childhood sweethearts separated by events. They’re so incredibly happy with only one fly in the ointment: Rebecca hates her new stepfather for taking the place of the father she never knew. When Angelet becomes pregnant, Rebecca looks forward to her new brother or sister arriving. What no one anticipates is how hard the birth is. And Benedict is like Sir Ronald, unforgiving. It’s a pair they are, two people hating in a family with a newborn. A few years later, disaster strikes at Christmas, and Lucie loses her mother tragically. Luckily, Rebecca and her grandparents are kindly people and take Lucie in. Lucky in so many ways… The Characters Rebecca is Angelet's beloved daughter. Angelet Mandeville lost her husband during a rescue attempt in Australia. Now she lives in London with her daughter and visits her grandparents often at Cador, their house in Cornwall. Miss Brown is Rebecca's governess. Mr. and Mrs. Emery are the handyman and housekeeper\/cook in the London house; they'll be elevated to butler and housekeeper when they move to Manorleigh The maids, Jane and Ann , will move as well. Mrs. Grant is the cook hired for Manorleigh. Alfred is a footman in the London house. The baby is Belinda Mary , and Leah will become her nurse. Jim Fedder is a groom in the Manorleigh stables. Miss Stringer is Belinda and Lucie's governess. Miss Martha is the daughter who survived her mother's, Lady Flamstead 's death. Sir Ronald never forgave her. Cador in Cornwall Rolf is Becca's grandfather; Annora is her grandmother. Jack is Angelet's brother; he and his wife, Marian , will inherit Cador when their parents die. They have two children, twins: Jacco and Anne-Mary . Mrs. Garnett is the cook at Cador. Jim Isaacs and Stubbs are two of the grooms. Dr. Wilmington is the family doctor. Madge is a new kitchen maid with a loose tongue. Pedrek Cartwright is Rebecca's best friend — they were born in the same house out in Australia. His grandparents, Josiah Pencarron and his wife, own a mine near Rebecca's grandparents' home in Cornwall. Justin and Morwenna Cartwright are Pedrek's parents who live in London. Benedict Lansdon is the grandson of \"Uncle\" Peter , a great friend of Rebecca's family. Amaryllis is Peter's wife. Peterkin is their son, and he works with his wife, Frances , at the Mission his father established. Helena is Peter and Amaryliss' daughter and is married to a politician, Martin Hume . I'm not sure where Grace Hume fits in, other than she's worked closely with Benedict at some point besides working at the Mission. The wealthy Lizzie Morley was Benedict's first wife. Celeste Bourdon will become his third. Yvette is her lady's maid. Oliver Gerson is a charming business colleague of Benedict's whom he inherited when Uncle Peter's businesses came to him. Tom Marner is an Australian mine owner and colleague who visits Benedict at Manorleigh. In Cornwall Jenny Stubbs is a young woman who lost a child she cared for and so lost a bit of her mind as well. She becomes pregnant with Lucie . She works for the kindly Mrs. Bullet and, I guess, Mrs. Granger . Mrs. Polhenny is an excellent midwife and vituperative religious nut job. Leah is her much-abused daughter who does beautiful embroidery. The Bourdons are French émigrés who will buy High Tor . Celeste is the daughter; the licentious Jean Pascal is the son. The Stennings are the latest tenants of High Tor. Madame Perrotte is teaching Rebecca to curtsy for her presentation. Jack Kellaway worked for Josiah and was injured in a mining accident. A tragedy left his wife, Mary , and daughter, Mary , alone. The Cover The cover is gothic enough with its woods and the tightly buttoned-up Rebecca sitting on the stone bench with her letter and the mysterious gentleman in the background. With all that orange on the ground, I’m tempted to say it’s autumn, but the trees still have their leaves. The title is where it ends up, with The Changeling . A rather obvious one."

This book has everything: deaths, ghosts, babies switched at birth, ravishments in old castles . . . and yet it's all very demurely done. I liked that quite a bit, it was very reminiscent of something like Wuthering Heights or Jane Eyre. Affairs and other scandalous matters were spoken of with veiled comments and euphemisms that were in keeping with the time period. The mysteries (there are a couple) are well done, as are the romances (there are a couple of those, too)."

Instead it is a stereotypical romance novel that just happens to be set in Victorian England. The author dropped a couple of names (Disraeli and Gladstone)and describes the Queen (in passing) as \"a diminutive figure with an expression of gloom and an air of aloofness which was rather disconcerting.\" But this was not enough to truly leave the reader with a sense of the time or place in which the story was set. Mystery? No mystery here. Read the title. Story? Read the jacket fly leaf and save yourself time. If you really like Harlequin Romances, you will probably like The Changeling.

        "text":"“The Changeling” is a refreshing change after the continual use of repeated themes in the past few books in the Daughters of England series. We don’t get the adulterous affairs, and the love story – which is usually the focal point – is a subplot. Family relationships are more prominent in this novel, largely owing to the main character Rebecca being a child when the story opens. One thing this author was very good at was creating child characters, and Lucie & Belinda are believable and vivid, as is the young Rebecca. I like these three characters and Oliver the most. This author, including her works as Victoria Holt, has a tendency to have her heroines refer to one of the male characters by both names, which really irritates me. This novel has several characters referred to by both names, as shown is the quoted dialogue exchange below: “Oh … ups and downs,” said Justin Cartwright. “I am sure you know as much about the mining world as I do … only I suppose tin isn’t gold.” “There must be a difference,” said Benedict Lansdon. “But my close connection with all that ended long ago.” “Ah, yes, of course,” replied Justin Cartwright. “I’m going into politics again,” said Benedict Lansdon, looking at my mother. Most annoying of all is the number of times Oliver Gerson is referred to by his full name. No other character’s first name is Oliver, & no other character’s surname is Gerson, so why not call him by one title or the other? Really bugs me! Another of this author's annoying traits is the overuse of reported speech: >“How did the wedding go?” I told them that all had gone according to plan.< Reported speech is passive. Why not make it active by changing it to dialogue? A few times, the author ruins the suspense with lines like these: >It was a happy Christmas, even for me … the last I was to know for a long time.< While lines of this type often make for good novel openers, they fall flat when inserted halfway through a story. It robs all suspense because you know for certain that something will happen. Also, the author provides her own spoiler with the book’s title. Without giving anything away, the revelation at the end is no surprise to the reader. Despite the above criticisms, I like the change in direction in this novel compared to its predecessors, and enjoyed it in the most part."

        "text":"Fifteenth in the Daughters of England historical fiction series in the gothic romance vein. The focus in this one is on a Victorian-era daughter, Rebecca Mandeville and her family. My Take A typical gothic romance with cozy overtones that thwart Carr's attempts to create tension and drama. I'm not sure if my frustration with this is due to how long ago this story was first released and the silly tropes used in this were typical of the writing styles when this was written or if this was an aberration. I know I liked Victoria Holt, one of Carr's pseudonym's, when I was a kid. That said, the protagonist, Rebecca, annoyed the hell out of me. She's such a snot. Granted, she has reason for her unhappiness, but even as she grows, she doesn't acknowledge how unfair she's been, although she's quite keen to disparage others for doing exactly what she's doing. She is so incredibly clueless… And I thought this was the Victorian era when single women couldn't go anywhere unattended? Rebecca goes EVERYwhere unattended. Including into some very dubious establishments. What is Rebecca, or should I say, what is Carr thinking? I'm confused. If Angelet and her husband went to Australia to make it big and come back to England to live in comfort, how has she managed her current comfort if he died there? Then there's Benedict's marriage to Celeste. Supposedly he needs a wife who can hostess dinners, etc. for this upcoming and brilliant politician. And she can barely speak English. How does this make her an asset? That penultimate scene between Pedrek and her…MAJOR eye roll there. I mean, duhhhh, all, and I mean ALL, the evidence is right in front of her and she's too stupid to make the connections??? Give. Me. A. Break. I thought she was supposed to be intelligent. The scene with Jacque-Philip at Tor Hill? Puh-lease. How naive can she be? Personally, I'd've leaped to the conclusion that the attacker was him way before anyone else! Tragedy, drama, whining, the stupid trope, it's all here. The ending was happy enough, and much too easy. The Story It’s so romantic that Angelet and Benedict are free to marry each other, having been childhood sweethearts separated by events. They’re so incredibly happy with only one fly in the ointment: Rebecca hates her new stepfather for taking the place of the father she never knew. When Angelet becomes pregnant, Rebecca looks forward to her new brother or sister arriving. What no one anticipates is how hard the birth is. And Benedict is like Sir Ronald, unforgiving. It’s a pair they are, two people hating in a family with a newborn. A few years later, disaster strikes at Christmas, and Lucie loses her mother tragically. Luckily, Rebecca and her grandparents are kindly people and take Lucie in. Lucky in so many ways… The Characters Rebecca is Angelet's beloved daughter. Angelet Mandeville lost her husband during a rescue attempt in Australia. Now she lives in London with her daughter and visits her grandparents often at Cador, their house in Cornwall. Miss Brown is Rebecca's governess. Mr. and Mrs. Emery are the handyman and housekeeper\/cook in the London house; they'll be elevated to butler and housekeeper when they move to Manorleigh The maids, Jane and Ann , will move as well. Mrs. Grant is the cook hired for Manorleigh. Alfred is a footman in the London house. The baby is Belinda Mary , and Leah will become her nurse. Jim Fedder is a groom in the Manorleigh stables. Miss Stringer is Belinda and Lucie's governess. Miss Martha is the daughter who survived her mother's, Lady Flamstead 's death. Sir Ronald never forgave her. Cador in Cornwall Rolf is Becca's grandfather; Annora is her grandmother. Jack is Angelet's brother; he and his wife, Marian , will inherit Cador when their parents die. They have two children, twins: Jacco and Anne-Mary . Mrs. Garnett is the cook at Cador. Jim Isaacs and Stubbs are two of the grooms. Dr. Wilmington is the family doctor. Madge is a new kitchen maid with a loose tongue. Pedrek Cartwright is Rebecca's best friend — they were born in the same house out in Australia. His grandparents, Josiah Pencarron and his wife, own a mine near Rebecca's grandparents' home in Cornwall. Justin and Morwenna Cartwright are Pedrek's parents who live in London. Benedict Lansdon is the grandson of \"Uncle\" Peter , a great friend of Rebecca's family. Amaryllis is Peter's wife. Peterkin is their son, and he works with his wife, Frances , at the Mission his father established. Helena is Peter and Amaryliss' daughter and is married to a politician, Martin Hume . I'm not sure where Grace Hume fits in, other than she's worked closely with Benedict at some point besides working at the Mission. The wealthy Lizzie Morley was Benedict's first wife. Celeste Bourdon will become his third. Yvette is her lady's maid. Oliver Gerson is a charming business colleague of Benedict's whom he inherited when Uncle Peter's businesses came to him. Tom Marner is an Australian mine owner and colleague who visits Benedict at Manorleigh. In Cornwall Jenny Stubbs is a young woman who lost a child she cared for and so lost a bit of her mind as well. She becomes pregnant with Lucie . She works for the kindly Mrs. Bullet and, I guess, Mrs. Granger . Mrs. Polhenny is an excellent midwife and vituperative religious nut job. Leah is her much-abused daughter who does beautiful embroidery. The Bourdons are French émigrés who will buy High Tor . Celeste is the daughter; the licentious Jean Pascal is the son. The Stennings are the latest tenants of High Tor. Madame Perrotte is teaching Rebecca to curtsy for her presentation. Jack Kellaway worked for Josiah and was injured in a mining accident. A tragedy left his wife, Mary , and daughter, Mary , alone. The Cover The cover is gothic enough with its woods and the tightly buttoned-up Rebecca sitting on the stone bench with her letter and the mysterious gentleman in the background. With all that orange on the ground, I’m tempted to say it’s autumn, but the trees still have their leaves. The title is where it ends up, with The Changeling . A rather obvious one."

This book has everything: deaths, ghosts, babies switched at birth, ravishments in old castles . . . and yet it's all very demurely done. I liked that quite a bit, it was very reminiscent of something like Wuthering Heights or Jane Eyre. Affairs and other scandalous matters were spoken of with veiled comments and euphemisms that were in keeping with the time period. The mysteries (there are a couple) are well done, as are the romances (there are a couple of those, too)."

Instead it is a stereotypical romance novel that just happens to be set in Victorian England. The author dropped a couple of names (Disraeli and Gladstone)and describes the Queen (in passing) as \"a diminutive figure with an expression of gloom and an air of aloofness which was rather disconcerting.\" But this was not enough to truly leave the reader with a sense of the time or place in which the story was set. Mystery? No mystery here. Read the title. Story? Read the jacket fly leaf and save yourself time. If you really like Harlequin Romances, you will probably like The Changeling.

        "text":"“The Changeling” is a refreshing change after the continual use of repeated themes in the past few books in the Daughters of England series. We don’t get the adulterous affairs, and the love story – which is usually the focal point – is a subplot. Family relationships are more prominent in this novel, largely owing to the main character Rebecca being a child when the story opens. One thing this author was very good at was creating child characters, and Lucie & Belinda are believable and vivid, as is the young Rebecca. I like these three characters and Oliver the most. This author, including her works as Victoria Holt, has a tendency to have her heroines refer to one of the male characters by both names, which really irritates me. This novel has several characters referred to by both names, as shown is the quoted dialogue exchange below: “Oh … ups and downs,” said Justin Cartwright. “I am sure you know as much about the mining world as I do … only I suppose tin isn’t gold.” “There must be a difference,” said Benedict Lansdon. “But my close connection with all that ended long ago.” “Ah, yes, of course,” replied Justin Cartwright. “I’m going into politics again,” said Benedict Lansdon, looking at my mother. Most annoying of all is the number of times Oliver Gerson is referred to by his full name. No other character’s first name is Oliver, & no other character’s surname is Gerson, so why not call him by one title or the other? Really bugs me! Another of this author's annoying traits is the overuse of reported speech: >“How did the wedding go?” I told them that all had gone according to plan.< Reported speech is passive. Why not make it active by changing it to dialogue? A few times, the author ruins the suspense with lines like these: >It was a happy Christmas, even for me … the last I was to know for a long time.< While lines of this type often make for good novel openers, they fall flat when inserted halfway through a story. It robs all suspense because you know for certain that something will happen. Also, the author provides her own spoiler with the book’s title. Without giving anything away, the revelation at the end is no surprise to the reader. Despite the above criticisms, I like the change in direction in this novel compared to its predecessors, and enjoyed it in the most part."

Becca is born in Australia in the same fine house as Pedrek, and when her father dies saving his in a mine accident, both grow up in Cornwall, childhood sweethearts.

The love between the protagonist Rebecca and her chosen man could've been fleshed out better so that it was more believable. The suspense was exciting, but was wrapped up ridiculously neatly at the end. And there was no scene showing the reaction of one character to an earth-shattering revelation! There's no reason we couldn't have gotten just one paragraph. This makes for a riveting read for those who have been following along with this family through the centuries and want to finish the series.

At the same time, a lot of the drama felt forced and manufactured in a way that took away from the believability of it, even given the expected melodrama, and there were more than a few times when I couldn't help rolling my eyes at the characters' behavior or the way the plot progressed. So, for what it is, I enjoyed it well enough, but it was something I had to be in the mood to pick up, and it was rarely the page-turner I'd been led to expect the author's works to be.

The Known World tells the story of Henry Townsend, a black farmer and former slave who falls under the tutelage of William Robbins, the most powerful man in Manchester County, Virginia. Making certain he never circumvents the law, Townsend runs his affairs with unusual discipline. But when death takes him unexpectedly, his widow, Caldonia, can't uphold the estate's order, and chaos ensues. Jones has woven a footnote of history into an epic that takes an unflinching look at slavery in all its moral complexities.",

        "text":"Manchester County, Virginia doesn't exist. Never has. After reading The Known World, however, you'd be forgiven if you thought you could take a tour of it's plantations and slave cemetaries on your vacation to colonial Williamsburg. The complicated pre-civil war Southern society that Edward P. Jones creates feels as real and surreal as any factual history of slavery you've read. It was not so much the story of Henry Townsend, a black slave owner, and all the people that his death allows us to meet that engaged me. It was the world, a world where I could taste the soil I might till and the women I might marry and the terrible choices I might be faced with, that put it's claws in me and refused to let go. It took me nearly 2 months to finish the book's 388 pages. It should've been a quick read. It is a fascinating place with peculiar problems and characters I cried for on more than one occasion. It should've been a quick read but I kept asking myself this question: who would I have been? The slave, toiling away in the field? The overseer, unable to see the world for what it truly was? The freed man, working desperately to free the rest of his family? The smart child, taken under the wing of the rich white slave owner and convinced that there was nothing wrong with owning another human being? The broken black man tortured by his family's wealth built on the backs of men and women that look just like me? The slave too proud, too strong, too powerful to let another take his freedom? Who would I have been? Who am I now? In matters of race, there is always that fool's point, usually made by a white person (though not always) that asks,\"why aren't you over it, already? Can't we just let it go?\" It is a way to end an uncomfortable conversation. The reasons don't matter. I know many a person for which the sticky tar baby of race in America is simply a discussion they can't stick their hands in. It is too difficult. Too raw. Too cloudy to be sure that people will remain friends after an honest chat. The way I feel when I read books like The Known World is my answer. No matter how well-adjusted, how integrated, how loving of my fellow man, how multiculti kumbayah I am, I'm not over it. I can't let it go. This fictional world was very real not all that long ago. It's effects still ripple through our every day. The world I know doesn't exist without it. Highly highly recommended."

        "text":"there is that old adage that a good book will tell you how to read it. and i have no idea to whom that should be attributed, only that my undergrad professors seemed to have been born to quote that thought endlessly: in my gothic lit class, my enlightenment class, my victorian lit class... the african and irish lit professors mostly kept their mouths shut on the subject. but the rest - hoo boy - did they love to drag that old chestnut out... and it makes sense, to a certain degree. but this book doesn't tell you how to read it so much as it presents itself to the reader, like a fat man in a speedo lolling around on an undersized towel saying, \"look at me ladies, you like it?? this is what you get!!\" it almost demands that you read it and like it. but i was disobedient. every sentence, every paragraph, seemed to be trying to contain multitudes. and i am a fan of \"thick\" writing, but the manner in which this book presented itself quickly soured on me. there were too many stories or episodes ending with, \"years from now, when celia was on her deathbed, she would think back to her third year of marriage\",in a scene where she has yet to even be married, or right after two characters are introduced to each other, \"this would be the last time they would meet until the hailstorm of aught-six\" - and i am making up all the names and situations here, but you get an idea of the shape of my complaints. it's constant foreshadowing and some of the foreshadowing is just teasing, as the events never come to pass in the novel itself. it's like sitting down to tea with a god in his dotage, rambling and making connections only he can understand; seeing the past and future simultaneously. \"hey, karen, didn't you really like that kjaerstaad trilogy, where he basically did what you are complaining about here??\" yeah, what? so? shut up - isn't it past your bedtime?? yeah, but sure, that's true. but for some reason, it bothered me here. all i wanted was a straightforward linear narrative about a fascinating subject matter: free black men and women who owned slaves. when i read roll of thunder, hear my cry last summer, the whole transition period between slavery and freedom really excited my brainparts. i dunno. and mister jones was a real sweetheart when he came for the new yorker festival and i waited in line to get a book signed for a friend and i really wanted to like it because it seems like a nice fat sprawling sweeping story the way i like, but i just got lost in the names and the timeline and my confusion turned into apathy. it's like this guy you date who seems really perfect - he is smart and looks like gabriel byrne and he dotes on you and everything is fun and on paper it all looks great and you know you should really like him, but he just doesn't make you laugh so you run off and leave him for a rockstar. you know? because i feel like i should like this one because it is award-winning, and my experience with the african-american novel is middling (although i love the african novel, the west indian novel and the afro-canadian novel - go figure) so i feel like as someone who appreciates literature in general, i should totally love this. but it wasn't there for me. oh, chris wilson, i am sorry. now you are going to want full custody because your baby is being raised among heathens. years from now, when my and chris wilson's book-baby became the mayor of littleton, he would read this review and a tear of sorrow would come to his eye at my short-sightedness. come to my blog!"

        "text":"I know this is a critically acclaimed book, a Pulitzer winner, and a book tackling a difficult and complex stain on America history: slavery and black slave owners. There are moments when the book does say some interesting things or reveal some unsavory and uncomfortable truths, but it was so hard to engage with as a reader. I mean, I hung in with DFW through the first 600 pages of Infinite Jest where nothing happens -- but because I was fascinated by Hal, Orin, Marathe, Steeply, and Mario and Madame Psychosis who all fascinated me. There were literally dozens of other characters but these all pulled me in. In The Known World, there are also dozens of characters but none that I grew any attachment too. It was as if the author Jones was using a hand-held camera and no stabilizer so that the images were jumpy and out of focus. It reminded me sometimes of how the world seems to my myopic eyes between taking off my glasses in the morning and putting in my contact lenses. The narration also highly annoyed me. All the parenthetical \"in 60 years so and so will do such as such\" were meaningless because I was given neither enough time nor enough detail to give a shit. Further, there is this reference to \"years later they would all turn into human torches in front of the dry foods store\", but no mention afterwards of to what this referred. But the most annoying bit was in using the Canadian journalist frame at about page 130 or so (which then only briefly appears in the narrative 200 pages later in a parenthetical throwaway comment, it is said that the journalist would never marry his heart's desire yet 3 pages later, they marry and that coming to talk to Fern that there was some incomprehensible stuff that happens off-screen that morning (also never adequately explained) and so she was not going to open up to the journalist and yet we still find her filling in details about Henry, Moses and Caledonia 30 pages later. Too much inconsistency - was the editor asleep or stoned and missed these? So, despite taking on a complex subject, Jones is no Faulkner as his South does not eve approach that of the Great William. He is not as good as Pynchon or DFW is manipulating time and space in a narrative that was 100 or 150 pages too long and felt it, and he is not Alice Walker or Toni Morrison who brought us the most amazing, poignant, and powerful images of slavery and its residual impacts generations later that I have ever read. So, read Beloved or Absalom, Absalom if you want to hear about the South and I expect you will be less frustrated, but every bit enraged at this deplorable institution that is a cancer on the American past."

        "text":"Ambitious, Interesting, Disorganized In an interview, Edward P. Jones revealed that The Known World took shape around 1) when he heard that Black people had owned slaves and 2) when he read a thin paperback in high school about a Jewish man who decided to join the Nazi party, how he acted in opposition to how one would expect. The Known World is an ambitious novel which aims to describe the world of 1855 where Henry Townsend has recently died. As a result of his death, a cloud of uncertainty hangs in the air as he leaves behind his widow, Caldonia, and the undetermined fate of the slaves he purchased to work his land. Although the plot is interesting, this book is disorganized. It covers many different characters and rapidly shifts time periods. I would be reading along and then the text would say “and this person lived to be 93 years old and had 235 grandchildren.” (paraphrasing) Countless times, I had to stop and reread because the storytelling was so clunky. In The Known World, there are quite a few references to Adam and Eve, even references to Milton (Paradise Lost). My favorite author, Philip Pullman, loves to talk about this topic and how in his works he wanted his characters to find their way back to The Garden by taking the long way around. So this quote on page 329 stood out: “There was a long way around but he chose not to take it.” There is a character in The Known World by the name of Anderson Frazier. He creates and distributes pamphlets and interviews Fern Elston. In my opinion, this pamphlet could have provided a framework to systematically organize the characters instead of the resulting jumbled and confusing soup of characters and timelines. The Known World has some unforgettable moments, but the organization of the narrative reduces the enjoyment of the reading experience.

        "text":"This is a complex novel, with dense writing, a non-linear structure, and an abundance of characters. It reads much like a true historical account of a place, Manchester County, Virginia, and time, pre-Civil War 1800s. This could very nearly have passed for a non-fiction book; each character feels so real, their personal stories and histories so authentic. The author even goes so far as to tell us what happens to many of them ten, twenty or even fifty years in the future. And yet, Edward P. Jones himself states: \"The county and town of Manchester, Virginia, and every human being in those places, are products of my imagination… The census records I made up for Manchester were, again, simply to make the reader feel that the town and the county and the people lived and breathed in central Virginia once upon a time…\" Well, consider me duped. At first I really thought such a county existed and the data presented were genuine facts. As my son passed through the living room, I even shouted out some sort of statistic or another and asked if he had ever read about such a thing in his history classes. He couldn’t recall, but it sounded ‘familiar’. Right, because much of this could have been true, yet it wasn’t. The institution of slavery of course was all too real and cruel, and that’s what this book is about, and this is the truth. Slavery in all its forms is evil. Henry Townsend is a black farmer. He is a former slave that with the purchase of freedom and some land becomes a slave owner himself. Henry and his wife Caldonia own a small plantation near the border of his former master’s much larger one. I could not wrap my head around why on earth a freed man would ever want to enslave another human being. Henry and other black slave owners like him justify their actions: \"Henry had always said that he wanted to be a better master than any white man he had ever known. He did not understand that the kind of world he wanted to create was doomed before he had even spoken the first syllable of the word master.\" Well, as the old saying goes, ‘the road to hell is paved with good intentions.’ When Henry dies, all hell breaks loose, and we begin to see the ill-fated consequences of an institution that is immoral and corrupt. A narrative that seems to jump around in time and between characters eventually comes together into a whole as consequences and events snowball out of control. Lives are permanently changed. Some for the worst, others (we hope) for the better. They all become woven together much like the massive tapestry hanging on the wall of another place in another time. Each is part of the story. Everyone is responsible for the events which passed, were allowed to pass despite the huge injustice to humanity. This book is not easy to read. The structure is challenging and the topic is gloomy, albeit important. What happens to the people we grow to care for is often horrifying and heartbreaking. But it is well-written and extremely impactful. An important novel which is well worth your time and attention if you are up for the challenge. It won't suit everyone, but if you are at all interested, I encourage you to pick this one up. \"What I feared most at that moment is what I still fear: that they would remember my history, that I, no matter what I had always said to the contrary, owned people of our Race.\""

I really thought when we got together that we would have a brief but mutually satisfying relationship. I'd read you, you'd provide enlightenment or emotional catharsis or entertainment, maybe even all three. All the signs were there: the laudatory quotes on your jacket, a shocking and unexpected premise, high marks on goodreads. But something was just off by the end of the first chapter. Maybe it was the masturbation scene right at the start. Or the characters that I just couldn't get into - I could hardly tell some of them apart. Or the way the narrative seemed to skip all over without any focus. Maybe I just didn't give you enough pages. I'm sure you got better as you went along. I mean, look at all the four- and five-star reviews you've gotten! But every time I picked you up my thoughts turned to the three other books on my bedside table that I'd rather be reading.

        "text":"There’s irony that I read more than half of this wrenching, ugly, hopeful, stirring, and grievous book while holding a sleeping baby in my arms. Because there is a lot of life and death in this take on pre-Civil War Virginia. I knew little about the book except that the author wrote it after reading about freed Black folks owning slaves. In delving into this issue, which in any modern conversation circle must bring dissonance, disbelief, and maybe even disgust, I became increasingly moved and disturbed. A difficult book, both because it’s an unflinching look at slavery, but also because it’s written in a James Joyce-ish style — lots of asides and stream of consciousness text. The author careens from generation to generation and back again in often the same paragraph. Yet it worked for me. It reads like a memoir of an entire county’s 150-year history complete with dozens of families represented. What results is simply, UNFORGETTABLE. There are characters whose faces I imagined while reading and characters whose stories I became invested in that will haunt me. Not in the truth of a fictional characterization but more because the ugliness of humanity was so blatantly on display and sadly remains real to this day. As I bid farewell to the slaves, slaveowners, children of both and ministers, sheriffs and patrollers of this novel, I will not forget their names. And I can’t help but wonder who would I have been in Manchester County, Virginia? (Reviewed 2\/12\/25)"

        "text":"I'm going to have to rave a bit, because this is one of the best books I've read in the past ten years. Jones packs in all the historical detail you could want, and of course he's hit on a subject--black slaveowners--that in and of itself is tabloid-sensational. Where lesser writers might lean too hard on the sensational aspect (or rely on it to bolster an otherwise weak narrative), Jones works it into a compelling and powerful story. What makes it so powerful is a mix of fascinating characters who are woven into a series of overlapping plotlines. For me it's the structuring that is so brilliant (geek alert: I actually diagrammed the time shifts in the chapters as an exercise, to see when and how Jones yoked the whole thing together). This less than linear approach might be frustrating to those who just want things to be straightforward, but stick with it: the shifts provide suspense as well as texture, and they propel more than one storyline at once. They do all come together, trust me. I also admire the overarching authorial voice in the novel, which certainly leans toward the formal, but also comes across as aware of the history it's grappling with: here and there Jones projects his voice forward for a moment, or seemingly digresses with factual material and research. Again it's all part of the tapestry and the mix, and I also think that the level of narrative awareness (which never disengages long enough to derail anything) adds another layer to the very idea of history--making the whole historical and contemporary both. And for those of you who can do without all of the above writerly blather (a thousand pardons), you'll find in this book characters who are engaging, ignorant, cruel, earnest, sympathetic, tragic, hopeful, flawed--in short, complicated. Halfway through you'll be fighting off the impulse to skip ahead to learn everyone's fate. Finally, I'll say that this book isn't perfect--there are aspects of what I've described above that sometimes don't work: narrative turns that do seem pointless digressions, a character or two a bit stereotypical or annoying. No matter. This book aims high, as brilliant works of art do, and the result is nothing short of amazing."

        "text":"This book demands that you read it slowly and intently. Like eating a huge Thanksgiving dinner, you need to pause and digest before you have the next course. At the outset, the plot seems to be all over the place, bouncing from character to character, telling too many stories, not telling enough and then seeming to tell too much. Ah, but then, you make a little progress and the rhythm begins to assert itself, the stories begin to weave together, the minute details begin to become a diorama, the picture stops being a blur and comes into sharp focus. This isn’t one man’s story, or even the story of one place, this is the story of all men and this is the tale of a world. This book is not so much about race as it is about the abject insanity and evil of the institution of slavery, wherever it is found, whoever is practicing it. In this system, there are free black masters holding black slaves, some of them well-meaning, but it does not make the practice any less immoral. There are white men who love their black mistresses and the children they bear, but it does not remove the fact that they hold a dominion over them that is not borne of love in any of its guises. There are also individuals who are victims of the system and others who refuse to be victims of the system, even at the cost of their lives. I loved many of Jones’ characters, notably Augustus and Mildred Townsend. They exemplify what is the best in us. I felt sorry for some of them, like Sheriff John Skiffington, who would like to be better than this society allows him to be, and Caldonia Townsend’s brother, Calvin, who wishes to go to New York so that he will not have to bear witness to the cruelties around him, cruelties he must realized have escaped him only because of a trick of fortune. I despised some of them, and I recognized most of them. The petty and jealous, who must have dominion over someone to feel they have worth; the ungrateful and traitorous, who would turn upon a friend to put some silver in their own pockets; the meek and hopeless, who bow to the yoke and try simply to find a corner in which they are allowed to exist; the defiant and strong-minded, who fight with their last breath because to do otherwise is to prop up the indefensible; all are here. What I loved most about this novel is its genuineness, its lack of exaggeration or hyperbole, where surely none is needed, its emphasis on the day-to-day injustice of an institution that is accepted as insurmountable or even correct only because it is what is. Edward P. Jones has leveled an attack at the heart of mankind and defied one to imagine what they would have done, what they would have dared to do, in such a place and time."

        "text":"A very complex and beautiful, compelling book about Henry, a former slave who becomes a slave owner, & his wife Caldonia. But they're just the start - the book is really a series of stories & vignettes about the families, friends, neighbors & community surrounding Henry & Caldonia. It took me a really long time to get into the book, because there are so many characters, some important & some not, & the book jumps around in time, making it difficult to follow. Trust me, use the cast of characters at the end of this edition (why not place this at the beginning?!) & give up your expectations about traditional narrative format, & you'll LOVE this book as much as I did. In life, we have our own story kind of playing in our head, & at the same time we have all these other stories we're hearing - the story about your mother's great-uncle. The story about your brother in law's neighbor. The one about your sister's husband's aunt & her neighbor. the one about your coworker's mother. You know all those stories? That's what this book is like - some characters are more important than others, so you hear more of their stories, but minor characters have stories too, & they sort of appear out of nowhere, & you get to hear their story, & then they're gone. It's really very cool! I particularly loved the story of the womanizing slave who has a vision during a lightning storm\/tornado - & becomes the founder of an orphanage. And the little tiny story about the family who don't want to give up their cow, & the woman goes into the barn to milk the cow & there's this lovely description of her squirting the cow's milk into a cat's mouth, & if you've ever seen a cat eat with true contentment you will recognize the cat body language that Jones describes. Toward the end of the book there's a very powerful scene where a character, who isn't a particularly \"good\" character, says there should be a lantern or light of truth in the world, an actual place where people can stand & tell the truth without fear of retribution, where one might be able to right a wrong. It's a moment where you think, yes this guy could right the wrong by speaking out, because his fear of having people think he's \"on the negro's side\" is...well, wrong! But that's his fear & in that moment of the book you understand it & you think, yeah, what if he could speak out under that light of truth & not have anyone judge him? How wonderful would that be? While the book depicts the horrors of slavery, & there are a few characters who are outright despicable, there are many shades of gray in Jones' vision as well. It's a book that will make you think about slavery, the myths & realities & tragedies of it all, & on top of that it'll make you think about your own life & all the people you've known & how complex & interesting we all are, really. It's beautifully written & the characters will stick in your head as if you'd known them too. Oddly, I think what I initially disliked most about this book - its multitude of characters & convoluted timeline - is what I ended up really enjoying! Another example of a book that made my head expand, with some creakiness, but I'm glad the expansion can still happen!"

        "text":"In this book I learned that there used to be black slaveholders in the US. I thought that only white people were allowed to own slaves during the time that owning slaves were like owning properties. During that pre-Abolition time. During those sad dark days in the American history. Black Edward P. Jones (born 1951) wrote this historical epic novel, The Known World based on the not well known fact that there were some black slaveholders (black people owning black slaves) in the state of Virginia during the time in the US when owning slave is legal. Wikipedia has this to say: \"Slavery in the United States was a form of unfree labor which existed as a legal institution in North America for more than a century before the founding of the United States in 1776, and continued mostly in the South until the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution in 1865.[1] The first English colony in North America, Virginia, first imported Africans in 1619, a practice earlier established in the Spanish colonies as early as the 1560s.[2] Most slaves were black and were held by whites, although some Native Americans and free blacks also held slaves; there were a small number of white slaves as well.[3]\" Winner of the 2004 Pulitzer Award for Fiction, The Known World is one of the most memorable reads I had this year. It is not an easy book to read. This 388-page novel left me with a heavy chest each time I closed the book. Each page is gloomy and sad. The novel is well-told with lyrical prose creating a big canvas of imagery in one's mind while reading. In that big canvas are memorable and three-dimensional numerous characters most of them black slaves. No character is downright bad or good. The detailed description of the sceneries of a fictional county called Manchester and the true depictions of the characters are exceptionally striking that I had to slow down in my reading to savor the story and hold on *tugging to them, cheering them on* to each characters. Reading the last page left me with a heavy heart. I would not want to let go of that image of Manchester and say goodbye Please don't go yet to the characters that I already became part of my literary world. The world that resides in the recesses of my brain. The world that is known only to me populated by people who I met only in my readings. In terms of writing, Jones extensively use the technique called prolepsis that I first encountered reading Muriel Sparks' The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie (1961). Jones explained this in the interview (appendix of the book) saying that he is the God of those characters so he knows what happened in the life of each characters from the time he\/she was born up to the time his\/her death. The most moving example of this use was with the character of the child Tessie . One fine day of September 1855, their mistress Caldonia saw the 5-y\/o Tessie playing with a wooden toy horse. Caldonia says to the child: That is very nice, Tessie to which Tessie responded, My papa did this for me . In January 2002, on her deathbed, the old Tessie asked her caretaker to get the wooden toy horse from the attic. While holding the toy, she breathed her last saying the same thing: My papa did this for me . My heart stopped beating. Tears welled up in my eyes. That scene is just one of the many moving scenes about those slaves in that time of the history in Virginia when black people were traded like they were not human but properties. I can make this review very long. There are just too many good things I would like to say here but I am afraid that no review can make justice to a book as good as this."

Free blacks owned other black people. Some free blacks bought their family members and others just wanted the slave labor. Native Americans owned slaves for much of the same reasons. The Known World introduces us to some of those people. The Known World has won a whole gang of awards, so we know its an important book and the writing is top notch. My only problems with the book were the fact that there were too many characters. You know this is a pet peeve of mine and I lost track of all the characters in this book. My other problem was that it jumped backwards and forwards in time way too much. Most of the time jumps were super confusing. I liked The Known World but I think I might not be smart enough to read this book. I'll probably reread it sometime in the future and I do recommend to others because its a brilliant book."

Wyatt Mason notes : What research on the subject Jones undertook was, in fact, quickly derailed after he happened upon an account of a white slave owner who spent her days abusing one of her black slaves, a little girl, by beating her head against a wall. “If I had wanted to tell the whole story of slavery, Americans couldn’t have taken that,” Jones told an interviewer. “People want to think that there was slavery, and then we got beyond it. People don’t want to hear that a woman would take a child and bang her head against the wall day after day. It’s nice that I didn’t read all those books. What I would have had to put down is far, far harsher and bleaker. Too much of a bummer? It's not that The Known World is a feel-good novel. Ears and Achilles tendons will be sliced. It follows the rules of slavery books: slave narratives always had happy endings; later, fictional slave narratives always have sad endings. But Toni Morrison has a different opinion about what Americans can and can't take. Shit, so does Harriet Jacobs. And Jones knows this, so he's being disingenuous. And you notice that he's talking about books he didn't actually read. NPR says, Jones collected two shelves of books about slavery, but never got around to reading them. Still, the author was able to use his imagination, and stories he had heard growing up, to make his characters come alive. \"I decided the people I'd created were real enough and I had just accumulated enough information about what the world was like in the South before 1865 to allow me to lie and get away with it,\" he says. Look, I don't mean to say Jones isn't telling the truth. I don't know if he is, and neither does he; neither of us read those two shelves of books about slavery. But the citation of imaginary sources in the book itself serves to either add authenticity that's undeserved, or - if you follow up on those sources - underline its lack of authenticity. I'm puzzled by it. This sort of meta-sourcing has been done before - by Nabokov in Pale Fire, by Cervantes, and in its closest parallel by Borges in his first collection, Universal History of Iniquity, which also confused me. It's especially jarring here, maybe just because I find the truth of slavery a fraught subject, and maybe because the layers go so deep - even in interviews about his lack of authenticity, he appears to be consciously inauthentic. I don't know, man, I don't get it. But anyway: is it a good made-up story about made-up people? Yeah, sure, totally. Eventually. The first half is a little annoying. There's a lot of chronological foofarah - skipping all over the place for no pressing reason - and a ginormous cast it's hard to keep track of, and our super-omniscient narrator often takes time out to tell you some trivial character's entire life story, which you didn't really need. But the second half ratchets up the tension to pure shit-your-pantsville, as that sprawling cast all meet their assorted fates. It makes up for some irritation in the first half. So yeah, as a novel it's excellent. The authenticity issue, I bring up mostly because we take this book seriously; it won a Pulitzer. It deserves to be looked carefully at. I looked carefully and I was confused by its truth."

        "text":"Despite some luminous moments where the characters come alive in a special way, this novel about the lives of slaves in a fictional community in Virginia of the 1830s felt too hermetic and sealed off for me to enjoy it as thoroughly as others might. The special hook that the story holds is its rendering of freed blacks who became slave owners themselves. The focus is on one such plantation with about 30 slaves which is struggling to adapt to the death of its black master, Henry Townsend. We get a plausible history along the way of how his father, Augustus, was so talented at furniture making that he bought his own freedom, and state legislative action allowed him to continue residing in the state and eventually bought the freedom of his son. With other free blacks, such as the feisty, condescending teacher Fern, who came from the North, they form a small society of their own. While Augustus abhors slavery, his son tries to emulate the path taken by the whites to economic success by owning slaves. Despite an ambition to become a benevolent master, the corrupting influence of owning people as property is well portrayed. When his lonely widow takes up a love relationship with her plantation foreman, she is replicating the same abuse of power enacted by most other white plantation owners, and the consequences are tragic. The “known world” of plantation life in this fictional county is like an island in time, and the characters themselves seem stuck in it like insects in amber. The omniscient narrator is god-like in passing into the thoughts and dreams of more than a dozen characters. Unfortunately, the reader gets distanced from emotionally connecting to them by the narrator breaking the flow to leap backward and forward in time to reveal some particular fact or person’s fate (for more see: D.D. Wood review ). Ultimately, the human bonds holding people to each other came off as tenuous and unreal as beholding a ship in a bottle. Unlike the romanticized lives portrayed in Hailey’s “Roots”, the characters have no sense of cultural history of their African origins (the word itself appears nowhere in the book), and there is no foreshadowing of plantation life as a doomed phase in history on the path to the Civil War. The idea of a slave revolt is unthinkable, and the one humane white character, Sheriff Skiffington, feels no compunction over diligently carrying out a big part of his job in organizing night patrols and retrieval efforts when “property” runs away. Though we get no sense of the reality of the “Underground Railroad”, we do get a brilliant vision at one point where Augustus ends up mailing a slave girl to Philadelphia in a crate along with a shipment of his hand-carved walking sticks. In an interview with Jones appended to the audiobook version of the novel, he admits he did not do much research for the book and was not concerned about communicating any particular message to his readers about the history of slavery. As the creator of all the characters, he would not admit to favoring any one character over another. Still the reader can’t help but getting the message of how inhumane slavery was and how individuals trapped in it strived to achieve some form of dignity in their lives. Like other reviewers, I didn’t feel I got to know any of the characters well enough to get emotionally engaged with them. When not interrupted by invasions from the narrator, the prose is effective in evoking the place and time, an obvious factor in helping it gain a Pulitzer Prize. Here is a lovely example from the opening for the book: The evening his master dies he worked again well after he ended the day for the other adults, his own wife among them, and sent them back with hunger and tiredness to their cabins. The young ones, his son among them, had been sent out of the fields an hour or so before the adults, to prepare the late supper and, if there was time enough, to play in a few minutes of sun that were left. When he, Moses, finally freed himself of the ancient and brittle harness that connected him to the oldest mule his master owned, all that was left of the sun was a five-inch long memory of red orange laid out in still waves across the horizon between two mountains on the left and one on the right. He had been in the fields for all of fourteen hours. He paused before leaving the fields as the evening quiet wrapped itself about him. The mule quivered, wanting home and rest. Moses closed his eyes and bent down and took a pinch of the soil and ate it with no more thought than if it were a spot of cornbread. …he ate it not only to discover the strengths and weaknesses of the field, but because eating it tied him to the only thing in his small world that meant almost as much as his own life."

        "text":"Glorious account that gets past cliches. The premise is that two slaves in 1840s Virginia bought their freedom, but their son stayed a little too long under the master's care. What does the family do when the son starts his own farm and buys his own slaves? The mastery of Jones' writing comes in the sense of history that he lends to minute objects, chance encounters, and incantatory reveries within a frought landscape. Not content to write an unwritten history of forgotten people, Jones re-writes the histories that have been written, citing documents the purport to explain the historical phenomenon of free blacks who owned slaves. Passages that carry runaway characters to the north also tie in academic treatises from the next century, deeds and warrants and court decisions that attempted to justify white supremacy, and the momentoes that emancipated children carry to their deathbeds. Jones doesn't neglect to include tales of individual transformation, collective redemption, or international implications in this epic. Characters may come and go like fleeting ghosts, yet the marks they leave may remain. When the words of the plantation master and deeds of the escaped overseer have faded into ineffectual memory, we readers are left with both the sense that an institution has gone horribly wrong and that the people within it can be honorably right; even if the results remain unapparent, the promise of future change remains, along with the threat of complacency and neglect. Jones didn't attempt to detail the national debate over slavery that was current at that time. That limitation on his project was probably a good one. It allows us to see the human effects that rhetoric had covered, and allowed him to devote his attentions to demonstrating the range of positions that people could occupy in relation to the institution. Yes, whether you're descended from a slave, a master, a freed man, a black woman passing as white, an unwilling overseer, a treacherous deputy, a conscientious drunk, or an immigrant Irishwoman sold into prostitution, there's something in this book for you - and I wish that I was only joking, but the irony is that there is no irony here, and sincerity is the least of what we have to do, and memory is only the start of making a history that hasn't stopped."

        "text":"Set in antebellum Virginia, a former slave, Henry Townsend, owns fifty acres of land and thirty-three slaves. As the story opens, Townsend is dying. The novel chronicles his life, the lives of his family members, and the lives of people he encountered in the community. The main characters are three-dimensional and feel like real people, with both admirable traits and flaws. Jones employs an omniscient narrator and non-linear storytelling. He weaves together overlapping stories of past and present events, such that the reader knows what happens to these people in the future before knowing what has happened to them in the book’s “present.” There are a great many characters in this book and the list of Dramatis Personae is helpful in keeping them all straight. This novel is based on a lesser known historical fact. While it was not common, it did happen that some free blacks owned slaves. It lends a complexity to the slavery narrative – showing how people can be impacted by society’s strictures and how victims of exploitation could become perpetrators of the same system. This is not a quick and easy read. It feels like being immersed in the life and times of Manchester County, Virginia, in the 1850s. It is an eloquently written condemnation of oppression in any form. This book won the Pulitzer Prize in 2004."

        "text":"2.5-stars, really. here is a perfect example of a books i should love, and yet.... i didn't. the book was a lot of work and, for me, very little reward. i think most of my issues are because of the style\/structure of the novel: * the third-person, omniscient narrator - this was distracting from very early on in the read. i held off judging it. i wanted to trust jones and his choice. * non-linear narrative - i don't tend to have problems with this at all, but i found it super-clunky here. also distracting. * the made-up references - jones would cite sources and details that seemed to lend such an air of gravitas, but none of it is actually real. (i know, i know. this is fiction. a novel. get over it. but it was just kinda weird to me. social commentary inserted into fiction happens. steinbeck did it. teju cole does it. many writers do this. i felt like jones did a crap-ton of research for this book. but then i read this NPR piece . in it, he notes he collected 2 shelves worth of books on slavery... \"but never got around to reading them\" . so this just added to my 'what the?' on the references in the novel and jones' research.) * all of this combined for a really awkward flow, and convoluted storytelling. i felt like it could lose 50-100 pages and be a tighter, better story. in case you think maybe i am a lazy reader - i'm not, i swear! i love nothing more than a meaty, tough read. jones' story is definitely both of these things. he explores the issue of free black people owning slaves in virginia, and he gives us a large cast of active characters. but it all felt so... surface-y. we get the actions and reactions, but we don't really get the motivations or emotions. jones is navigating a morally dodgy landscape, one i would have loved to have gone into more deeply. we are given the horrors and the heartbreaks, but it all felt so detached. and, you know, maybe that is totally on purpose. maybe, for some people, detachment is the only way through such a horrible time in history. jones has collected some serious critical acclaim and recognition over his career. to name a few: he's won the pulitzer, the national book critic's circle award, the PEN\/Hemingway award, a MacArthur genius grant, and the International IMPAC dublin literary award. he's won nearly $1 million in literary awards alone. the man knows what he's doing, and the respect he's earned is fairly universal. the known world is an important story. but is just shining the light on the issues jones raises enough? so now i am back to the should . i should love this book. (it was just okay for me.) people should read this book. (indeed. but this is not a book i will blanket recommend to all.) so, i don't know you guys. i am bummed over this one. and this is a terrible review\/collection of thoughts. maybe i'll become more coherent with some distance and fix this up a bit - but for now i wanted to note down something here. (aside #1 (going to be a bit spoiler-y here): moses confused me. or, rather, his turn to all-of-a-sudden being an asshole was weird. we're going along with moses. he seems like a lovely man. then, halfway into the book, he's a wife-beater, jerkface? where did that come from, and why was he presented like that? the reveal of moses being a not nice man was sudden and odd.) (aside #2: worth noting (was hugely interesting to me) - the cover photo of this edition is © Eudora Welty ! i had no idea about her photographic prowess .)"

        "text":"Here is a book about black slave owners in the antebellum South! My interest was immediately piqued. On top of that, the book has won all sorts of prizes: *Pulitzer Prize for Fiction (2004) *International Dublin Literary Award (2005) *Anisfield-Wolf Book Award (2004) *National Book Critics Circle Award for Fiction (2003) * Hurston\/Wright Legacy Award Nominee for Debut Fiction (\/2004 *National Book Award Finalist for Fiction (2003) I knew I had to give it a try. I am glad I have read it, but to say I like it, would just not be true. It’s OK, so I am giving it two stars. There is no real central character to the story, because he dies right off the bat. It is 1855 when Henry Townsend dies. He is black. He had been a slave, but his parents had bought him his freedom. He leaves behind no children but a wife, Caldonia, a twenty-eight-year-old educated black woman born free, and his property of thirty-three slaves and fifty acres in Manchester County, Virginia. The book is about the hell that breaks loose afterwards, but really what it is about is life in the South during the antebellum era, about the mindset of Blacks and Whites of this era. The story is told by an omniscient narrator—who knows how each character thinks, what has happened to all of them in the past and what will happen to all of them in the future. It is this all-seeing narrator that shapes the entire feel of the story. This narrator knows everything, but he is not particularly adept at cogently telling a story. In one sentence you may switch form the present to the future and back again. In the next sentence you flip back to the past. It is easy to become confused. Character upon character is thrown at you, with little tidbits about their lives in the past, present and future. You are given an entire community of individuals—Whites and Blacks, a Native American or two, those who are free and those who are slaves, a sheriff and his deputy. The omniscient narrator is constantly restating who each one is, which is good in one sense, but the flow of the tale becomes jerky. Stop and start, backward and forward and often confusing. Use of the omniscient narrator is pushed to the extreme. It is kind of nice to have a character or two to guide you through a story. You do not have that here. There are a whole group of characters, characters that are hard to attach yourself to. You do not get close to any one individual. In the afterword the author points out that he wanted to draw characters that were neither all good nor all bad, each one different in their own way. You do get that here, but you fail to feel anything for any of them. What you do get is a strong sense of being one of a large community. You are there, one among many, living in the antebellum South. This does give one a hands-on feeling of life then and there and how people were thinking. Kevin Free narrates the audiobook. It is simple to follow, the speed is fine and he intonations are well done. The narration performance is good so I have given the narration three stars."

        "text":"I attended a workshop with some friends during which we all went around the room and recommended books that really moved us that year. I don't remember which book I suggested then, but I recall one woman in particular who really loved this book (or I believe she was more in love with Edward Jones' writing). At the end of the workshop we had a gift exchange raffle and she included this book as her contribution. I was the lucky recipient of this free copy. I was interested in this historical novel set in a fictional place in Virginia during the antebellum era, about a former slave who ends up owning slaves. The strangeness of the story and the angle it takes as a slave narrative is intriguing. Also appealing is the way the omniscient narration allows the reader to approach the story without the moral judgement one reserves for this kind of story, since the distance of the narration allows one to realize quickly what the story tries to showcase: how slavery has already poisoned the integrity of all involved. The framework of the novel is composed of anecdotal stories within stories, with pacing often interrupted for a mini scene or two, or an introduction of yet another character who may reappear later or simply disappear. Put another way, it is a book of puzzle pieces: one is added, taken away, another picked up, oh yes, there's the whole, whoops, maybe not, here goes another piece. So although I admired the writing and story setup in the beginning, I just was not in the right space to complete this novel. It has been a while since I added a book to my \"did-not-finish\" list; alas, this one has just made the list. This is not a failed attempt at reading this novel, however, because I remember not being able to finish Ngugi wa Thiong'o's Wizard of the Crow only to later fall in love with his novel, Petals of Blood . With that in mind, I look forward to reading Jones' Lost in the City ."

While not exactly removing race from the issue of slavery, Jones is able to show that even among African-Americans the perniciousness of slavery could damn a generation. The best summary of this idea came from a NYTimes review: 'There are few certified villains in this novel, white or black, because slavery poisons moral judgments at the root. As Jones shows, slavery corrupts good intentions and underwrites bad ones, yet allows decency the odd occasion -- but only by creating such an enormous need for it.' The pacing and structure of this novel could be a little challenging to some, but I found that it fit the narrative perfectly. This isn't a novel that burns you with its quotable sentences, but it scars you with its images. There were periods in it where I thought I was reading a Cormac McCarthy novel. That alone is high praise."

        "text":"When Toni Morrison began her research for \"Beloved,\" she discovered a trove of ghastly instruments. She knew, of course, that slaves were routinely whipped, starved, raped, and hanged, but the existence of specially forged tools was a surprise: metal bits forced down the throat, iron masks locked across the face, spiked collars clasped around the neck. Her Pulitzer Prize-winning novel reintroduced those horrors into the national memory and did much to demonstrate that the cruelties of slavery extended far beyond hard labor and physical deprivation. \"The Known World,\" by Edward Jones, reclaims another peculiarity of American slavery and in the process illustrates yet again that we can't under- estimate its perverse contortions of the human spirit. Bizarre as it sounds, in Louisiana, Virginia, and South Carolina, a small number of free blacks owned their own plantations - and their own slaves. It was a precarious arrangement, to be sure. Blacks who were freed or managed to buy their own freedom had little incentive to tarry in the South. The laws governing their status and their right to hold property were ambiguous and easy for any white person to shred. Jones uses this fragile situation as the setting for a novel about a group of black and white Virginians who tried - sometimes nobly, often viciously - to maintain their world in the face of inevitable collapse. To the extent that Morrison spun a surreal tale of American slavery into mythic proportions, Jones has carved a companion series of stark anecdotes into national legends. In a measured voice that never rises to reflect the agonies and absurdities he describes, he moves back and forth through decades and across state lines, assembling an apparently random collection of brief scenes that gradually fuse into a stunning portrait of moral confusion. The story revolves around Henry Townsend, a black man who, with the indulgence of his former owner, managed to buy his own farm and his own slaves - eventually 29 adults and a collection of children. Henry's parents, who labored tirelessly to free him as a child, are horrified by his participation in the flesh market, but Henry is ambitious, and, what's more, he learned from his master that \"once you own even one, you will never be alone.\" As a protection against loneliness and a way to wealth, Henry can't imagine anything more successful, and he's convinced he can be \"a better master than any white man he had ever known.\" Indeed, he attains that dubious goal, creating a plantation with forced labor that's largely free of physical beatings, but it's an insidious gentility that only camouflages the humiliations of Southern slavery. Nevertheless, his untimely death frightens most of his slaves, who know just how delicate their relative comfort is. Only the brooding overseer, Moses, the first slave Henry ever bought, sees his master's demise as an opportunity - not for freedom, but for taking his place. Indeed, what interests Jones most in this complex novel is the way slavery distorts judgment, not just of those who oppress, but of those who are oppressed. Henry's widow, Caldonia, quickly decides against freeing \"her legacy,\" choosing instead to maintain the plantation in the spirit of Henry's gentle example. \"Her husband had done the best he could,\" she thinks, \"and on Judgment Day his slaves would stand before God and testify to that fact.\" Occasionally, a child is worked to death or a pregnant woman labors in the field till she miscarries, but Caldonia sheds sincere tears, comforts the parents, and considers whether she should buy insurance against further losses of her property. As a single woman with a large business to run, she's encouraged by a collection of family and friends, other free blacks, some of whom own their own slaves, too. One of the most troubling is Fern, Caldonia's prim teacher of literature and etiquette. Together, they keep the irony of their position well buried, while socializing in a kind of racial terrarium maintained by William Robbins, the county's wealthiest white farmer. Estranged from his own wife but protected by his political power, he loves a black woman in town and openly adores his two mulatto children. The Townsend plantation with its little coterie of free slave-owning blacks gives his favorites a place to play and refine themselves. In one of several shifts to the late 19th century, a Canadian historian interviews Fern, Caldonia's teacher, about those days on the plantation. \"All of us do only what the law and God tell us we can do,\" she says without any hint of guilt or remorse. \"We owned slaves. It was what was done, and so that is what we did.\" Jones uses that same tone of historical distance throughout, a tone that amplifies the grotesque mingling of affection and cruelty that infected these people, black and white. In the center of this moral kaleidoscope stands the sheriff, John Skiffington, an earnest Christian, dedicated to the objective application of law and convinced that \"the law always cares\" for everyone equally. It's a doomed endeavor, of course, but as Caldonia's plantation begins to collapse, Skiffington fails to realize that the legal system he's sworn to uphold is not objective and that he cannot remain clean within it. The scrambled collection of events and characters makes this a difficult story to enter, but that structure eventually accounts for much of the novel's evocative power. Jones has a kind of biblical style that suggests whole lives in a few stark details from a perspective that's alternately microscopic and telescopic. It's a technique that resists our efforts to keep these events in some unrecoverable past. The troubling implications of his story leach in through hairline cracks all over the twin shells of antebellum nostalgia and Northern piety. Every time Caldonia cheerfully reminds her friends, \"We are all worthy of one another,\" the legacy of slavery sounds more complex and unresolved. http:\/\/www.csmonitor.com\/2003\/0814\/p1..."

After reading The Known World, however, you'd be forgiven if you thought you could take a tour of it's plantations and slave cemetaries on your vacation to colonial Williamsburg. The complicated pre-civil war Southern society that Edward P. Jones creates feels as real and surreal as any factual history of slavery you've read. It was not so much the story of Henry Townsend, a black slave owner, and all the people that his death allows us to meet that engaged me. It was the world, a world where I could taste the soil I might till and the women I might marry and the terrible choices I might be faced with, that put it's claws in me and refused to let go. It took me nearly 2 months to finish the book's 388 pages. It should've been a quick read. It is a fascinating place with peculiar problems and characters I cried for on more than one occasion. It should've been a quick read but I kept asking myself this question: who would I have been? The slave, toiling away in the field? The overseer, unable to see the world for what it truly was? The freed man, working desperately to free the rest of his family? The smart child, taken under the wing of the rich white slave owner and convinced that there was nothing wrong with owning another human being? The broken black man tortured by his family's wealth built on the backs of men and women that look just like me? The slave too proud, too strong, too powerful to let another take his freedom? Who would I have been? Who am I now? In matters of race, there is always that fool's point, usually made by a white person (though not always) that asks,\"why aren't you over it, already? Can't we just let it go?\" It is a way to end an uncomfortable conversation. The reasons don't matter. I know many a person for which the sticky tar baby of race in America is simply a discussion they can't stick their hands in. It is too difficult. Too raw. Too cloudy to be sure that people will remain friends after an honest chat. The way I feel when I read books like The Known World is my answer. No matter how well-adjusted, how integrated, how loving of my fellow man, how multiculti kumbayah I am, I'm not over it. I can't let it go. This fictional world was very real not all that long ago. It's effects still ripple through our every day. The world I know doesn't exist without it. Highly highly recommended."

        "text":"there is that old adage that a good book will tell you how to read it. and i have no idea to whom that should be attributed, only that my undergrad professors seemed to have been born to quote that thought endlessly: in my gothic lit class, my enlightenment class, my victorian lit class... the african and irish lit professors mostly kept their mouths shut on the subject. but the rest - hoo boy - did they love to drag that old chestnut out... and it makes sense, to a certain degree. but this book doesn't tell you how to read it so much as it presents itself to the reader, like a fat man in a speedo lolling around on an undersized towel saying, \"look at me ladies, you like it?? this is what you get!!\" it almost demands that you read it and like it. but i was disobedient. every sentence, every paragraph, seemed to be trying to contain multitudes. and i am a fan of \"thick\" writing, but the manner in which this book presented itself quickly soured on me. there were too many stories or episodes ending with, \"years from now, when celia was on her deathbed, she would think back to her third year of marriage\",in a scene where she has yet to even be married, or right after two characters are introduced to each other, \"this would be the last time they would meet until the hailstorm of aught-six\" - and i am making up all the names and situations here, but you get an idea of the shape of my complaints. it's constant foreshadowing and some of the foreshadowing is just teasing, as the events never come to pass in the novel itself. it's like sitting down to tea with a god in his dotage, rambling and making connections only he can understand; seeing the past and future simultaneously. \"hey, karen, didn't you really like that kjaerstaad trilogy, where he basically did what you are complaining about here??\" yeah, what? so? shut up - isn't it past your bedtime?? yeah, but sure, that's true. but for some reason, it bothered me here. all i wanted was a straightforward linear narrative about a fascinating subject matter: free black men and women who owned slaves. when i read roll of thunder, hear my cry last summer, the whole transition period between slavery and freedom really excited my brainparts. i dunno. and mister jones was a real sweetheart when he came for the new yorker festival and i waited in line to get a book signed for a friend and i really wanted to like it because it seems like a nice fat sprawling sweeping story the way i like, but i just got lost in the names and the timeline and my confusion turned into apathy. it's like this guy you date who seems really perfect - he is smart and looks like gabriel byrne and he dotes on you and everything is fun and on paper it all looks great and you know you should really like him, but he just doesn't make you laugh so you run off and leave him for a rockstar. you know? because i feel like i should like this one because it is award-winning, and my experience with the african-american novel is middling (although i love the african novel, the west indian novel and the afro-canadian novel - go figure) so i feel like as someone who appreciates literature in general, i should totally love this. but it wasn't there for me. oh, chris wilson, i am sorry. now you are going to want full custody because your baby is being raised among heathens. years from now, when my and chris wilson's book-baby became the mayor of littleton, he would read this review and a tear of sorrow would come to his eye at my short-sightedness. come to my blog!"

        "text":"I know this is a critically acclaimed book, a Pulitzer winner, and a book tackling a difficult and complex stain on America history: slavery and black slave owners. There are moments when the book does say some interesting things or reveal some unsavory and uncomfortable truths, but it was so hard to engage with as a reader. I mean, I hung in with DFW through the first 600 pages of Infinite Jest where nothing happens -- but because I was fascinated by Hal, Orin, Marathe, Steeply, and Mario and Madame Psychosis who all fascinated me. There were literally dozens of other characters but these all pulled me in. In The Known World, there are also dozens of characters but none that I grew any attachment too. It was as if the author Jones was using a hand-held camera and no stabilizer so that the images were jumpy and out of focus. It reminded me sometimes of how the world seems to my myopic eyes between taking off my glasses in the morning and putting in my contact lenses. The narration also highly annoyed me. All the parenthetical \"in 60 years so and so will do such as such\" were meaningless because I was given neither enough time nor enough detail to give a shit. Further, there is this reference to \"years later they would all turn into human torches in front of the dry foods store\", but no mention afterwards of to what this referred. But the most annoying bit was in using the Canadian journalist frame at about page 130 or so (which then only briefly appears in the narrative 200 pages later in a parenthetical throwaway comment, it is said that the journalist would never marry his heart's desire yet 3 pages later, they marry and that coming to talk to Fern that there was some incomprehensible stuff that happens off-screen that morning (also never adequately explained) and so she was not going to open up to the journalist and yet we still find her filling in details about Henry, Moses and Caledonia 30 pages later. Too much inconsistency - was the editor asleep or stoned and missed these? So, despite taking on a complex subject, Jones is no Faulkner as his South does not eve approach that of the Great William. He is not as good as Pynchon or DFW is manipulating time and space in a narrative that was 100 or 150 pages too long and felt it, and he is not Alice Walker or Toni Morrison who brought us the most amazing, poignant, and powerful images of slavery and its residual impacts generations later that I have ever read. So, read Beloved or Absalom, Absalom if you want to hear about the South and I expect you will be less frustrated, but every bit enraged at this deplorable institution that is a cancer on the American past."

        "text":"Ambitious, Interesting, Disorganized In an interview, Edward P. Jones revealed that The Known World took shape around 1) when he heard that Black people had owned slaves and 2) when he read a thin paperback in high school about a Jewish man who decided to join the Nazi party, how he acted in opposition to how one would expect. The Known World is an ambitious novel which aims to describe the world of 1855 where Henry Townsend has recently died. As a result of his death, a cloud of uncertainty hangs in the air as he leaves behind his widow, Caldonia, and the undetermined fate of the slaves he purchased to work his land. Although the plot is interesting, this book is disorganized. It covers many different characters and rapidly shifts time periods. I would be reading along and then the text would say “and this person lived to be 93 years old and had 235 grandchildren.” (paraphrasing) Countless times, I had to stop and reread because the storytelling was so clunky. In The Known World, there are quite a few references to Adam and Eve, even references to Milton (Paradise Lost). My favorite author, Philip Pullman, loves to talk about this topic and how in his works he wanted his characters to find their way back to The Garden by taking the long way around. So this quote on page 329 stood out: “There was a long way around but he chose not to take it.” There is a character in The Known World by the name of Anderson Frazier. He creates and distributes pamphlets and interviews Fern Elston. In my opinion, this pamphlet could have provided a framework to systematically organize the characters instead of the resulting jumbled and confusing soup of characters and timelines. The Known World has some unforgettable moments, but the organization of the narrative reduces the enjoyment of the reading experience.

        "text":"This is a complex novel, with dense writing, a non-linear structure, and an abundance of characters. It reads much like a true historical account of a place, Manchester County, Virginia, and time, pre-Civil War 1800s. This could very nearly have passed for a non-fiction book; each character feels so real, their personal stories and histories so authentic. The author even goes so far as to tell us what happens to many of them ten, twenty or even fifty years in the future. And yet, Edward P. Jones himself states: \"The county and town of Manchester, Virginia, and every human being in those places, are products of my imagination… The census records I made up for Manchester were, again, simply to make the reader feel that the town and the county and the people lived and breathed in central Virginia once upon a time…\" Well, consider me duped. At first I really thought such a county existed and the data presented were genuine facts. As my son passed through the living room, I even shouted out some sort of statistic or another and asked if he had ever read about such a thing in his history classes. He couldn’t recall, but it sounded ‘familiar’. Right, because much of this could have been true, yet it wasn’t. The institution of slavery of course was all too real and cruel, and that’s what this book is about, and this is the truth. Slavery in all its forms is evil. Henry Townsend is a black farmer. He is a former slave that with the purchase of freedom and some land becomes a slave owner himself. Henry and his wife Caldonia own a small plantation near the border of his former master’s much larger one. I could not wrap my head around why on earth a freed man would ever want to enslave another human being. Henry and other black slave owners like him justify their actions: \"Henry had always said that he wanted to be a better master than any white man he had ever known. He did not understand that the kind of world he wanted to create was doomed before he had even spoken the first syllable of the word master.\" Well, as the old saying goes, ‘the road to hell is paved with good intentions.’ When Henry dies, all hell breaks loose, and we begin to see the ill-fated consequences of an institution that is immoral and corrupt. A narrative that seems to jump around in time and between characters eventually comes together into a whole as consequences and events snowball out of control. Lives are permanently changed. Some for the worst, others (we hope) for the better. They all become woven together much like the massive tapestry hanging on the wall of another place in another time. Each is part of the story. Everyone is responsible for the events which passed, were allowed to pass despite the huge injustice to humanity. This book is not easy to read. The structure is challenging and the topic is gloomy, albeit important. What happens to the people we grow to care for is often horrifying and heartbreaking. But it is well-written and extremely impactful. An important novel which is well worth your time and attention if you are up for the challenge. It won't suit everyone, but if you are at all interested, I encourage you to pick this one up. \"What I feared most at that moment is what I still fear: that they would remember my history, that I, no matter what I had always said to the contrary, owned people of our Race.\""

I really thought when we got together that we would have a brief but mutually satisfying relationship. I'd read you, you'd provide enlightenment or emotional catharsis or entertainment, maybe even all three. All the signs were there: the laudatory quotes on your jacket, a shocking and unexpected premise, high marks on goodreads. But something was just off by the end of the first chapter. Maybe it was the masturbation scene right at the start. Or the characters that I just couldn't get into - I could hardly tell some of them apart. Or the way the narrative seemed to skip all over without any focus. Maybe I just didn't give you enough pages. I'm sure you got better as you went along. I mean, look at all the four- and five-star reviews you've gotten! But every time I picked you up my thoughts turned to the three other books on my bedside table that I'd rather be reading.

        "text":"There’s irony that I read more than half of this wrenching, ugly, hopeful, stirring, and grievous book while holding a sleeping baby in my arms. Because there is a lot of life and death in this take on pre-Civil War Virginia. I knew little about the book except that the author wrote it after reading about freed Black folks owning slaves. In delving into this issue, which in any modern conversation circle must bring dissonance, disbelief, and maybe even disgust, I became increasingly moved and disturbed. A difficult book, both because it’s an unflinching look at slavery, but also because it’s written in a James Joyce-ish style — lots of asides and stream of consciousness text. The author careens from generation to generation and back again in often the same paragraph. Yet it worked for me. It reads like a memoir of an entire county’s 150-year history complete with dozens of families represented. What results is simply, UNFORGETTABLE. There are characters whose faces I imagined while reading and characters whose stories I became invested in that will haunt me. Not in the truth of a fictional characterization but more because the ugliness of humanity was so blatantly on display and sadly remains real to this day. As I bid farewell to the slaves, slaveowners, children of both and ministers, sheriffs and patrollers of this novel, I will not forget their names. And I can’t help but wonder who would I have been in Manchester County, Virginia? (Reviewed 2\/12\/25)"

        "text":"I'm going to have to rave a bit, because this is one of the best books I've read in the past ten years. Jones packs in all the historical detail you could want, and of course he's hit on a subject--black slaveowners--that in and of itself is tabloid-sensational. Where lesser writers might lean too hard on the sensational aspect (or rely on it to bolster an otherwise weak narrative), Jones works it into a compelling and powerful story. What makes it so powerful is a mix of fascinating characters who are woven into a series of overlapping plotlines. For me it's the structuring that is so brilliant (geek alert: I actually diagrammed the time shifts in the chapters as an exercise, to see when and how Jones yoked the whole thing together). This less than linear approach might be frustrating to those who just want things to be straightforward, but stick with it: the shifts provide suspense as well as texture, and they propel more than one storyline at once. They do all come together, trust me. I also admire the overarching authorial voice in the novel, which certainly leans toward the formal, but also comes across as aware of the history it's grappling with: here and there Jones projects his voice forward for a moment, or seemingly digresses with factual material and research. Again it's all part of the tapestry and the mix, and I also think that the level of narrative awareness (which never disengages long enough to derail anything) adds another layer to the very idea of history--making the whole historical and contemporary both. And for those of you who can do without all of the above writerly blather (a thousand pardons), you'll find in this book characters who are engaging, ignorant, cruel, earnest, sympathetic, tragic, hopeful, flawed--in short, complicated. Halfway through you'll be fighting off the impulse to skip ahead to learn everyone's fate. Finally, I'll say that this book isn't perfect--there are aspects of what I've described above that sometimes don't work: narrative turns that do seem pointless digressions, a character or two a bit stereotypical or annoying. No matter. This book aims high, as brilliant works of art do, and the result is nothing short of amazing."

        "text":"This book demands that you read it slowly and intently. Like eating a huge Thanksgiving dinner, you need to pause and digest before you have the next course. At the outset, the plot seems to be all over the place, bouncing from character to character, telling too many stories, not telling enough and then seeming to tell too much. Ah, but then, you make a little progress and the rhythm begins to assert itself, the stories begin to weave together, the minute details begin to become a diorama, the picture stops being a blur and comes into sharp focus. This isn’t one man’s story, or even the story of one place, this is the story of all men and this is the tale of a world. This book is not so much about race as it is about the abject insanity and evil of the institution of slavery, wherever it is found, whoever is practicing it. In this system, there are free black masters holding black slaves, some of them well-meaning, but it does not make the practice any less immoral. There are white men who love their black mistresses and the children they bear, but it does not remove the fact that they hold a dominion over them that is not borne of love in any of its guises. There are also individuals who are victims of the system and others who refuse to be victims of the system, even at the cost of their lives. I loved many of Jones’ characters, notably Augustus and Mildred Townsend. They exemplify what is the best in us. I felt sorry for some of them, like Sheriff John Skiffington, who would like to be better than this society allows him to be, and Caldonia Townsend’s brother, Calvin, who wishes to go to New York so that he will not have to bear witness to the cruelties around him, cruelties he must realized have escaped him only because of a trick of fortune. I despised some of them, and I recognized most of them. The petty and jealous, who must have dominion over someone to feel they have worth; the ungrateful and traitorous, who would turn upon a friend to put some silver in their own pockets; the meek and hopeless, who bow to the yoke and try simply to find a corner in which they are allowed to exist; the defiant and strong-minded, who fight with their last breath because to do otherwise is to prop up the indefensible; all are here. What I loved most about this novel is its genuineness, its lack of exaggeration or hyperbole, where surely none is needed, its emphasis on the day-to-day injustice of an institution that is accepted as insurmountable or even correct only because it is what is. Edward P. Jones has leveled an attack at the heart of mankind and defied one to imagine what they would have done, what they would have dared to do, in such a place and time."

        "text":"A very complex and beautiful, compelling book about Henry, a former slave who becomes a slave owner, & his wife Caldonia. But they're just the start - the book is really a series of stories & vignettes about the families, friends, neighbors & community surrounding Henry & Caldonia. It took me a really long time to get into the book, because there are so many characters, some important & some not, & the book jumps around in time, making it difficult to follow. Trust me, use the cast of characters at the end of this edition (why not place this at the beginning?!) & give up your expectations about traditional narrative format, & you'll LOVE this book as much as I did. In life, we have our own story kind of playing in our head, & at the same time we have all these other stories we're hearing - the story about your mother's great-uncle. The story about your brother in law's neighbor. The one about your sister's husband's aunt & her neighbor. the one about your coworker's mother. You know all those stories? That's what this book is like - some characters are more important than others, so you hear more of their stories, but minor characters have stories too, & they sort of appear out of nowhere, & you get to hear their story, & then they're gone. It's really very cool! I particularly loved the story of the womanizing slave who has a vision during a lightning storm\/tornado - & becomes the founder of an orphanage. And the little tiny story about the family who don't want to give up their cow, & the woman goes into the barn to milk the cow & there's this lovely description of her squirting the cow's milk into a cat's mouth, & if you've ever seen a cat eat with true contentment you will recognize the cat body language that Jones describes. Toward the end of the book there's a very powerful scene where a character, who isn't a particularly \"good\" character, says there should be a lantern or light of truth in the world, an actual place where people can stand & tell the truth without fear of retribution, where one might be able to right a wrong. It's a moment where you think, yes this guy could right the wrong by speaking out, because his fear of having people think he's \"on the negro's side\" is...well, wrong! But that's his fear & in that moment of the book you understand it & you think, yeah, what if he could speak out under that light of truth & not have anyone judge him? How wonderful would that be? While the book depicts the horrors of slavery, & there are a few characters who are outright despicable, there are many shades of gray in Jones' vision as well. It's a book that will make you think about slavery, the myths & realities & tragedies of it all, & on top of that it'll make you think about your own life & all the people you've known & how complex & interesting we all are, really. It's beautifully written & the characters will stick in your head as if you'd known them too. Oddly, I think what I initially disliked most about this book - its multitude of characters & convoluted timeline - is what I ended up really enjoying! Another example of a book that made my head expand, with some creakiness, but I'm glad the expansion can still happen!"

        "text":"In this book I learned that there used to be black slaveholders in the US. I thought that only white people were allowed to own slaves during the time that owning slaves were like owning properties. During that pre-Abolition time. During those sad dark days in the American history. Black Edward P. Jones (born 1951) wrote this historical epic novel, The Known World based on the not well known fact that there were some black slaveholders (black people owning black slaves) in the state of Virginia during the time in the US when owning slave is legal. Wikipedia has this to say: \"Slavery in the United States was a form of unfree labor which existed as a legal institution in North America for more than a century before the founding of the United States in 1776, and continued mostly in the South until the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution in 1865.[1] The first English colony in North America, Virginia, first imported Africans in 1619, a practice earlier established in the Spanish colonies as early as the 1560s.[2] Most slaves were black and were held by whites, although some Native Americans and free blacks also held slaves; there were a small number of white slaves as well.[3]\" Winner of the 2004 Pulitzer Award for Fiction, The Known World is one of the most memorable reads I had this year. It is not an easy book to read. This 388-page novel left me with a heavy chest each time I closed the book. Each page is gloomy and sad. The novel is well-told with lyrical prose creating a big canvas of imagery in one's mind while reading. In that big canvas are memorable and three-dimensional numerous characters most of them black slaves. No character is downright bad or good. The detailed description of the sceneries of a fictional county called Manchester and the true depictions of the characters are exceptionally striking that I had to slow down in my reading to savor the story and hold on *tugging to them, cheering them on* to each characters. Reading the last page left me with a heavy heart. I would not want to let go of that image of Manchester and say goodbye Please don't go yet to the characters that I already became part of my literary world. The world that resides in the recesses of my brain. The world that is known only to me populated by people who I met only in my readings. In terms of writing, Jones extensively use the technique called prolepsis that I first encountered reading Muriel Sparks' The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie (1961). Jones explained this in the interview (appendix of the book) saying that he is the God of those characters so he knows what happened in the life of each characters from the time he\/she was born up to the time his\/her death. The most moving example of this use was with the character of the child Tessie . One fine day of September 1855, their mistress Caldonia saw the 5-y\/o Tessie playing with a wooden toy horse. Caldonia says to the child: That is very nice, Tessie to which Tessie responded, My papa did this for me . In January 2002, on her deathbed, the old Tessie asked her caretaker to get the wooden toy horse from the attic. While holding the toy, she breathed her last saying the same thing: My papa did this for me . My heart stopped beating. Tears welled up in my eyes. That scene is just one of the many moving scenes about those slaves in that time of the history in Virginia when black people were traded like they were not human but properties. I can make this review very long. There are just too many good things I would like to say here but I am afraid that no review can make justice to a book as good as this."

Free blacks owned other black people. Some free blacks bought their family members and others just wanted the slave labor. Native Americans owned slaves for much of the same reasons. The Known World introduces us to some of those people. The Known World has won a whole gang of awards, so we know its an important book and the writing is top notch. My only problems with the book were the fact that there were too many characters. You know this is a pet peeve of mine and I lost track of all the characters in this book. My other problem was that it jumped backwards and forwards in time way too much. Most of the time jumps were super confusing. I liked The Known World but I think I might not be smart enough to read this book. I'll probably reread it sometime in the future and I do recommend to others because its a brilliant book."

Wyatt Mason notes : What research on the subject Jones undertook was, in fact, quickly derailed after he happened upon an account of a white slave owner who spent her days abusing one of her black slaves, a little girl, by beating her head against a wall. “If I had wanted to tell the whole story of slavery, Americans couldn’t have taken that,” Jones told an interviewer. “People want to think that there was slavery, and then we got beyond it. People don’t want to hear that a woman would take a child and bang her head against the wall day after day. It’s nice that I didn’t read all those books. What I would have had to put down is far, far harsher and bleaker. Too much of a bummer? It's not that The Known World is a feel-good novel. Ears and Achilles tendons will be sliced. It follows the rules of slavery books: slave narratives always had happy endings; later, fictional slave narratives always have sad endings. But Toni Morrison has a different opinion about what Americans can and can't take. Shit, so does Harriet Jacobs. And Jones knows this, so he's being disingenuous. And you notice that he's talking about books he didn't actually read. NPR says, Jones collected two shelves of books about slavery, but never got around to reading them. Still, the author was able to use his imagination, and stories he had heard growing up, to make his characters come alive. \"I decided the people I'd created were real enough and I had just accumulated enough information about what the world was like in the South before 1865 to allow me to lie and get away with it,\" he says. Look, I don't mean to say Jones isn't telling the truth. I don't know if he is, and neither does he; neither of us read those two shelves of books about slavery. But the citation of imaginary sources in the book itself serves to either add authenticity that's undeserved, or - if you follow up on those sources - underline its lack of authenticity. I'm puzzled by it. This sort of meta-sourcing has been done before - by Nabokov in Pale Fire, by Cervantes, and in its closest parallel by Borges in his first collection, Universal History of Iniquity, which also confused me. It's especially jarring here, maybe just because I find the truth of slavery a fraught subject, and maybe because the layers go so deep - even in interviews about his lack of authenticity, he appears to be consciously inauthentic. I don't know, man, I don't get it. But anyway: is it a good made-up story about made-up people? Yeah, sure, totally. Eventually. The first half is a little annoying. There's a lot of chronological foofarah - skipping all over the place for no pressing reason - and a ginormous cast it's hard to keep track of, and our super-omniscient narrator often takes time out to tell you some trivial character's entire life story, which you didn't really need. But the second half ratchets up the tension to pure shit-your-pantsville, as that sprawling cast all meet their assorted fates. It makes up for some irritation in the first half. So yeah, as a novel it's excellent. The authenticity issue, I bring up mostly because we take this book seriously; it won a Pulitzer. It deserves to be looked carefully at. I looked carefully and I was confused by its truth."

        "text":"Despite some luminous moments where the characters come alive in a special way, this novel about the lives of slaves in a fictional community in Virginia of the 1830s felt too hermetic and sealed off for me to enjoy it as thoroughly as others might. The special hook that the story holds is its rendering of freed blacks who became slave owners themselves. The focus is on one such plantation with about 30 slaves which is struggling to adapt to the death of its black master, Henry Townsend. We get a plausible history along the way of how his father, Augustus, was so talented at furniture making that he bought his own freedom, and state legislative action allowed him to continue residing in the state and eventually bought the freedom of his son. With other free blacks, such as the feisty, condescending teacher Fern, who came from the North, they form a small society of their own. While Augustus abhors slavery, his son tries to emulate the path taken by the whites to economic success by owning slaves. Despite an ambition to become a benevolent master, the corrupting influence of owning people as property is well portrayed. When his lonely widow takes up a love relationship with her plantation foreman, she is replicating the same abuse of power enacted by most other white plantation owners, and the consequences are tragic. The “known world” of plantation life in this fictional county is like an island in time, and the characters themselves seem stuck in it like insects in amber. The omniscient narrator is god-like in passing into the thoughts and dreams of more than a dozen characters. Unfortunately, the reader gets distanced from emotionally connecting to them by the narrator breaking the flow to leap backward and forward in time to reveal some particular fact or person’s fate (for more see: D.D. Wood review ). Ultimately, the human bonds holding people to each other came off as tenuous and unreal as beholding a ship in a bottle. Unlike the romanticized lives portrayed in Hailey’s “Roots”, the characters have no sense of cultural history of their African origins (the word itself appears nowhere in the book), and there is no foreshadowing of plantation life as a doomed phase in history on the path to the Civil War. The idea of a slave revolt is unthinkable, and the one humane white character, Sheriff Skiffington, feels no compunction over diligently carrying out a big part of his job in organizing night patrols and retrieval efforts when “property” runs away. Though we get no sense of the reality of the “Underground Railroad”, we do get a brilliant vision at one point where Augustus ends up mailing a slave girl to Philadelphia in a crate along with a shipment of his hand-carved walking sticks. In an interview with Jones appended to the audiobook version of the novel, he admits he did not do much research for the book and was not concerned about communicating any particular message to his readers about the history of slavery. As the creator of all the characters, he would not admit to favoring any one character over another. Still the reader can’t help but getting the message of how inhumane slavery was and how individuals trapped in it strived to achieve some form of dignity in their lives. Like other reviewers, I didn’t feel I got to know any of the characters well enough to get emotionally engaged with them. When not interrupted by invasions from the narrator, the prose is effective in evoking the place and time, an obvious factor in helping it gain a Pulitzer Prize. Here is a lovely example from the opening for the book: The evening his master dies he worked again well after he ended the day for the other adults, his own wife among them, and sent them back with hunger and tiredness to their cabins. The young ones, his son among them, had been sent out of the fields an hour or so before the adults, to prepare the late supper and, if there was time enough, to play in a few minutes of sun that were left. When he, Moses, finally freed himself of the ancient and brittle harness that connected him to the oldest mule his master owned, all that was left of the sun was a five-inch long memory of red orange laid out in still waves across the horizon between two mountains on the left and one on the right. He had been in the fields for all of fourteen hours. He paused before leaving the fields as the evening quiet wrapped itself about him. The mule quivered, wanting home and rest. Moses closed his eyes and bent down and took a pinch of the soil and ate it with no more thought than if it were a spot of cornbread. …he ate it not only to discover the strengths and weaknesses of the field, but because eating it tied him to the only thing in his small world that meant almost as much as his own life."

        "text":"Glorious account that gets past cliches. The premise is that two slaves in 1840s Virginia bought their freedom, but their son stayed a little too long under the master's care. What does the family do when the son starts his own farm and buys his own slaves? The mastery of Jones' writing comes in the sense of history that he lends to minute objects, chance encounters, and incantatory reveries within a frought landscape. Not content to write an unwritten history of forgotten people, Jones re-writes the histories that have been written, citing documents the purport to explain the historical phenomenon of free blacks who owned slaves. Passages that carry runaway characters to the north also tie in academic treatises from the next century, deeds and warrants and court decisions that attempted to justify white supremacy, and the momentoes that emancipated children carry to their deathbeds. Jones doesn't neglect to include tales of individual transformation, collective redemption, or international implications in this epic. Characters may come and go like fleeting ghosts, yet the marks they leave may remain. When the words of the plantation master and deeds of the escaped overseer have faded into ineffectual memory, we readers are left with both the sense that an institution has gone horribly wrong and that the people within it can be honorably right; even if the results remain unapparent, the promise of future change remains, along with the threat of complacency and neglect. Jones didn't attempt to detail the national debate over slavery that was current at that time. That limitation on his project was probably a good one. It allows us to see the human effects that rhetoric had covered, and allowed him to devote his attentions to demonstrating the range of positions that people could occupy in relation to the institution. Yes, whether you're descended from a slave, a master, a freed man, a black woman passing as white, an unwilling overseer, a treacherous deputy, a conscientious drunk, or an immigrant Irishwoman sold into prostitution, there's something in this book for you - and I wish that I was only joking, but the irony is that there is no irony here, and sincerity is the least of what we have to do, and memory is only the start of making a history that hasn't stopped."

        "text":"Set in antebellum Virginia, a former slave, Henry Townsend, owns fifty acres of land and thirty-three slaves. As the story opens, Townsend is dying. The novel chronicles his life, the lives of his family members, and the lives of people he encountered in the community. The main characters are three-dimensional and feel like real people, with both admirable traits and flaws. Jones employs an omniscient narrator and non-linear storytelling. He weaves together overlapping stories of past and present events, such that the reader knows what happens to these people in the future before knowing what has happened to them in the book’s “present.” There are a great many characters in this book and the list of Dramatis Personae is helpful in keeping them all straight. This novel is based on a lesser known historical fact. While it was not common, it did happen that some free blacks owned slaves. It lends a complexity to the slavery narrative – showing how people can be impacted by society’s strictures and how victims of exploitation could become perpetrators of the same system. This is not a quick and easy read. It feels like being immersed in the life and times of Manchester County, Virginia, in the 1850s. It is an eloquently written condemnation of oppression in any form. This book won the Pulitzer Prize in 2004."

        "text":"2.5-stars, really. here is a perfect example of a books i should love, and yet.... i didn't. the book was a lot of work and, for me, very little reward. i think most of my issues are because of the style\/structure of the novel: * the third-person, omniscient narrator - this was distracting from very early on in the read. i held off judging it. i wanted to trust jones and his choice. * non-linear narrative - i don't tend to have problems with this at all, but i found it super-clunky here. also distracting. * the made-up references - jones would cite sources and details that seemed to lend such an air of gravitas, but none of it is actually real. (i know, i know. this is fiction. a novel. get over it. but it was just kinda weird to me. social commentary inserted into fiction happens. steinbeck did it. teju cole does it. many writers do this. i felt like jones did a crap-ton of research for this book. but then i read this NPR piece . in it, he notes he collected 2 shelves worth of books on slavery... \"but never got around to reading them\" . so this just added to my 'what the?' on the references in the novel and jones' research.) * all of this combined for a really awkward flow, and convoluted storytelling. i felt like it could lose 50-100 pages and be a tighter, better story. in case you think maybe i am a lazy reader - i'm not, i swear! i love nothing more than a meaty, tough read. jones' story is definitely both of these things. he explores the issue of free black people owning slaves in virginia, and he gives us a large cast of active characters. but it all felt so... surface-y. we get the actions and reactions, but we don't really get the motivations or emotions. jones is navigating a morally dodgy landscape, one i would have loved to have gone into more deeply. we are given the horrors and the heartbreaks, but it all felt so detached. and, you know, maybe that is totally on purpose. maybe, for some people, detachment is the only way through such a horrible time in history. jones has collected some serious critical acclaim and recognition over his career. to name a few: he's won the pulitzer, the national book critic's circle award, the PEN\/Hemingway award, a MacArthur genius grant, and the International IMPAC dublin literary award. he's won nearly $1 million in literary awards alone. the man knows what he's doing, and the respect he's earned is fairly universal. the known world is an important story. but is just shining the light on the issues jones raises enough? so now i am back to the should . i should love this book. (it was just okay for me.) people should read this book. (indeed. but this is not a book i will blanket recommend to all.) so, i don't know you guys. i am bummed over this one. and this is a terrible review\/collection of thoughts. maybe i'll become more coherent with some distance and fix this up a bit - but for now i wanted to note down something here. (aside #1 (going to be a bit spoiler-y here): moses confused me. or, rather, his turn to all-of-a-sudden being an asshole was weird. we're going along with moses. he seems like a lovely man. then, halfway into the book, he's a wife-beater, jerkface? where did that come from, and why was he presented like that? the reveal of moses being a not nice man was sudden and odd.) (aside #2: worth noting (was hugely interesting to me) - the cover photo of this edition is © Eudora Welty ! i had no idea about her photographic prowess .)"

        "text":"Here is a book about black slave owners in the antebellum South! My interest was immediately piqued. On top of that, the book has won all sorts of prizes: *Pulitzer Prize for Fiction (2004) *International Dublin Literary Award (2005) *Anisfield-Wolf Book Award (2004) *National Book Critics Circle Award for Fiction (2003) * Hurston\/Wright Legacy Award Nominee for Debut Fiction (\/2004 *National Book Award Finalist for Fiction (2003) I knew I had to give it a try. I am glad I have read it, but to say I like it, would just not be true. It’s OK, so I am giving it two stars. There is no real central character to the story, because he dies right off the bat. It is 1855 when Henry Townsend dies. He is black. He had been a slave, but his parents had bought him his freedom. He leaves behind no children but a wife, Caldonia, a twenty-eight-year-old educated black woman born free, and his property of thirty-three slaves and fifty acres in Manchester County, Virginia. The book is about the hell that breaks loose afterwards, but really what it is about is life in the South during the antebellum era, about the mindset of Blacks and Whites of this era. The story is told by an omniscient narrator—who knows how each character thinks, what has happened to all of them in the past and what will happen to all of them in the future. It is this all-seeing narrator that shapes the entire feel of the story. This narrator knows everything, but he is not particularly adept at cogently telling a story. In one sentence you may switch form the present to the future and back again. In the next sentence you flip back to the past. It is easy to become confused. Character upon character is thrown at you, with little tidbits about their lives in the past, present and future. You are given an entire community of individuals—Whites and Blacks, a Native American or two, those who are free and those who are slaves, a sheriff and his deputy. The omniscient narrator is constantly restating who each one is, which is good in one sense, but the flow of the tale becomes jerky. Stop and start, backward and forward and often confusing. Use of the omniscient narrator is pushed to the extreme. It is kind of nice to have a character or two to guide you through a story. You do not have that here. There are a whole group of characters, characters that are hard to attach yourself to. You do not get close to any one individual. In the afterword the author points out that he wanted to draw characters that were neither all good nor all bad, each one different in their own way. You do get that here, but you fail to feel anything for any of them. What you do get is a strong sense of being one of a large community. You are there, one among many, living in the antebellum South. This does give one a hands-on feeling of life then and there and how people were thinking. Kevin Free narrates the audiobook. It is simple to follow, the speed is fine and he intonations are well done. The narration performance is good so I have given the narration three stars."

        "text":"I attended a workshop with some friends during which we all went around the room and recommended books that really moved us that year. I don't remember which book I suggested then, but I recall one woman in particular who really loved this book (or I believe she was more in love with Edward Jones' writing). At the end of the workshop we had a gift exchange raffle and she included this book as her contribution. I was the lucky recipient of this free copy. I was interested in this historical novel set in a fictional place in Virginia during the antebellum era, about a former slave who ends up owning slaves. The strangeness of the story and the angle it takes as a slave narrative is intriguing. Also appealing is the way the omniscient narration allows the reader to approach the story without the moral judgement one reserves for this kind of story, since the distance of the narration allows one to realize quickly what the story tries to showcase: how slavery has already poisoned the integrity of all involved. The framework of the novel is composed of anecdotal stories within stories, with pacing often interrupted for a mini scene or two, or an introduction of yet another character who may reappear later or simply disappear. Put another way, it is a book of puzzle pieces: one is added, taken away, another picked up, oh yes, there's the whole, whoops, maybe not, here goes another piece. So although I admired the writing and story setup in the beginning, I just was not in the right space to complete this novel. It has been a while since I added a book to my \"did-not-finish\" list; alas, this one has just made the list. This is not a failed attempt at reading this novel, however, because I remember not being able to finish Ngugi wa Thiong'o's Wizard of the Crow only to later fall in love with his novel, Petals of Blood . With that in mind, I look forward to reading Jones' Lost in the City ."

While not exactly removing race from the issue of slavery, Jones is able to show that even among African-Americans the perniciousness of slavery could damn a generation. The best summary of this idea came from a NYTimes review: 'There are few certified villains in this novel, white or black, because slavery poisons moral judgments at the root. As Jones shows, slavery corrupts good intentions and underwrites bad ones, yet allows decency the odd occasion -- but only by creating such an enormous need for it.' The pacing and structure of this novel could be a little challenging to some, but I found that it fit the narrative perfectly. This isn't a novel that burns you with its quotable sentences, but it scars you with its images. There were periods in it where I thought I was reading a Cormac McCarthy novel. That alone is high praise."

        "text":"When Toni Morrison began her research for \"Beloved,\" she discovered a trove of ghastly instruments. She knew, of course, that slaves were routinely whipped, starved, raped, and hanged, but the existence of specially forged tools was a surprise: metal bits forced down the throat, iron masks locked across the face, spiked collars clasped around the neck. Her Pulitzer Prize-winning novel reintroduced those horrors into the national memory and did much to demonstrate that the cruelties of slavery extended far beyond hard labor and physical deprivation. \"The Known World,\" by Edward Jones, reclaims another peculiarity of American slavery and in the process illustrates yet again that we can't under- estimate its perverse contortions of the human spirit. Bizarre as it sounds, in Louisiana, Virginia, and South Carolina, a small number of free blacks owned their own plantations - and their own slaves. It was a precarious arrangement, to be sure. Blacks who were freed or managed to buy their own freedom had little incentive to tarry in the South. The laws governing their status and their right to hold property were ambiguous and easy for any white person to shred. Jones uses this fragile situation as the setting for a novel about a group of black and white Virginians who tried - sometimes nobly, often viciously - to maintain their world in the face of inevitable collapse. To the extent that Morrison spun a surreal tale of American slavery into mythic proportions, Jones has carved a companion series of stark anecdotes into national legends. In a measured voice that never rises to reflect the agonies and absurdities he describes, he moves back and forth through decades and across state lines, assembling an apparently random collection of brief scenes that gradually fuse into a stunning portrait of moral confusion. The story revolves around Henry Townsend, a black man who, with the indulgence of his former owner, managed to buy his own farm and his own slaves - eventually 29 adults and a collection of children. Henry's parents, who labored tirelessly to free him as a child, are horrified by his participation in the flesh market, but Henry is ambitious, and, what's more, he learned from his master that \"once you own even one, you will never be alone.\" As a protection against loneliness and a way to wealth, Henry can't imagine anything more successful, and he's convinced he can be \"a better master than any white man he had ever known.\" Indeed, he attains that dubious goal, creating a plantation with forced labor that's largely free of physical beatings, but it's an insidious gentility that only camouflages the humiliations of Southern slavery. Nevertheless, his untimely death frightens most of his slaves, who know just how delicate their relative comfort is. Only the brooding overseer, Moses, the first slave Henry ever bought, sees his master's demise as an opportunity - not for freedom, but for taking his place. Indeed, what interests Jones most in this complex novel is the way slavery distorts judgment, not just of those who oppress, but of those who are oppressed. Henry's widow, Caldonia, quickly decides against freeing \"her legacy,\" choosing instead to maintain the plantation in the spirit of Henry's gentle example. \"Her husband had done the best he could,\" she thinks, \"and on Judgment Day his slaves would stand before God and testify to that fact.\" Occasionally, a child is worked to death or a pregnant woman labors in the field till she miscarries, but Caldonia sheds sincere tears, comforts the parents, and considers whether she should buy insurance against further losses of her property. As a single woman with a large business to run, she's encouraged by a collection of family and friends, other free blacks, some of whom own their own slaves, too. One of the most troubling is Fern, Caldonia's prim teacher of literature and etiquette. Together, they keep the irony of their position well buried, while socializing in a kind of racial terrarium maintained by William Robbins, the county's wealthiest white farmer. Estranged from his own wife but protected by his political power, he loves a black woman in town and openly adores his two mulatto children. The Townsend plantation with its little coterie of free slave-owning blacks gives his favorites a place to play and refine themselves. In one of several shifts to the late 19th century, a Canadian historian interviews Fern, Caldonia's teacher, about those days on the plantation. \"All of us do only what the law and God tell us we can do,\" she says without any hint of guilt or remorse. \"We owned slaves. It was what was done, and so that is what we did.\" Jones uses that same tone of historical distance throughout, a tone that amplifies the grotesque mingling of affection and cruelty that infected these people, black and white. In the center of this moral kaleidoscope stands the sheriff, John Skiffington, an earnest Christian, dedicated to the objective application of law and convinced that \"the law always cares\" for everyone equally. It's a doomed endeavor, of course, but as Caldonia's plantation begins to collapse, Skiffington fails to realize that the legal system he's sworn to uphold is not objective and that he cannot remain clean within it. The scrambled collection of events and characters makes this a difficult story to enter, but that structure eventually accounts for much of the novel's evocative power. Jones has a kind of biblical style that suggests whole lives in a few stark details from a perspective that's alternately microscopic and telescopic. It's a technique that resists our efforts to keep these events in some unrecoverable past. The troubling implications of his story leach in through hairline cracks all over the twin shells of antebellum nostalgia and Northern piety. Every time Caldonia cheerfully reminds her friends, \"We are all worthy of one another,\" the legacy of slavery sounds more complex and unresolved. http:\/\/www.csmonitor.com\/2003\/0814\/p1..."

After reading The Known World, however, you'd be forgiven if you thought you could take a tour of it's plantations and slave cemetaries on your vacation to colonial Williamsburg. The complicated pre-civil war Southern society that Edward P. Jones creates feels as real and surreal as any factual history of slavery you've read. It was not so much the story of Henry Townsend, a black slave owner, and all the people that his death allows us to meet that engaged me. It was the world, a world where I could taste the soil I might till and the women I might marry and the terrible choices I might be faced with, that put it's claws in me and refused to let go. It took me nearly 2 months to finish the book's 388 pages. It should've been a quick read. It is a fascinating place with peculiar problems and characters I cried for on more than one occasion. It should've been a quick read but I kept asking myself this question: who would I have been? The slave, toiling away in the field? The overseer, unable to see the world for what it truly was? The freed man, working desperately to free the rest of his family? The smart child, taken under the wing of the rich white slave owner and convinced that there was nothing wrong with owning another human being? The broken black man tortured by his family's wealth built on the backs of men and women that look just like me? The slave too proud, too strong, too powerful to let another take his freedom? Who would I have been? Who am I now? In matters of race, there is always that fool's point, usually made by a white person (though not always) that asks,\"why aren't you over it, already? Can't we just let it go?\" It is a way to end an uncomfortable conversation. The reasons don't matter. I know many a person for which the sticky tar baby of race in America is simply a discussion they can't stick their hands in. It is too difficult. Too raw. Too cloudy to be sure that people will remain friends after an honest chat. The way I feel when I read books like The Known World is my answer. No matter how well-adjusted, how integrated, how loving of my fellow man, how multiculti kumbayah I am, I'm not over it. I can't let it go. This fictional world was very real not all that long ago. It's effects still ripple through our every day. The world I know doesn't exist without it. Highly highly recommended."

        "text":"there is that old adage that a good book will tell you how to read it. and i have no idea to whom that should be attributed, only that my undergrad professors seemed to have been born to quote that thought endlessly: in my gothic lit class, my enlightenment class, my victorian lit class... the african and irish lit professors mostly kept their mouths shut on the subject. but the rest - hoo boy - did they love to drag that old chestnut out... and it makes sense, to a certain degree. but this book doesn't tell you how to read it so much as it presents itself to the reader, like a fat man in a speedo lolling around on an undersized towel saying, \"look at me ladies, you like it?? this is what you get!!\" it almost demands that you read it and like it. but i was disobedient. every sentence, every paragraph, seemed to be trying to contain multitudes. and i am a fan of \"thick\" writing, but the manner in which this book presented itself quickly soured on me. there were too many stories or episodes ending with, \"years from now, when celia was on her deathbed, she would think back to her third year of marriage\",in a scene where she has yet to even be married, or right after two characters are introduced to each other, \"this would be the last time they would meet until the hailstorm of aught-six\" - and i am making up all the names and situations here, but you get an idea of the shape of my complaints. it's constant foreshadowing and some of the foreshadowing is just teasing, as the events never come to pass in the novel itself. it's like sitting down to tea with a god in his dotage, rambling and making connections only he can understand; seeing the past and future simultaneously. \"hey, karen, didn't you really like that kjaerstaad trilogy, where he basically did what you are complaining about here??\" yeah, what? so? shut up - isn't it past your bedtime?? yeah, but sure, that's true. but for some reason, it bothered me here. all i wanted was a straightforward linear narrative about a fascinating subject matter: free black men and women who owned slaves. when i read roll of thunder, hear my cry last summer, the whole transition period between slavery and freedom really excited my brainparts. i dunno. and mister jones was a real sweetheart when he came for the new yorker festival and i waited in line to get a book signed for a friend and i really wanted to like it because it seems like a nice fat sprawling sweeping story the way i like, but i just got lost in the names and the timeline and my confusion turned into apathy. it's like this guy you date who seems really perfect - he is smart and looks like gabriel byrne and he dotes on you and everything is fun and on paper it all looks great and you know you should really like him, but he just doesn't make you laugh so you run off and leave him for a rockstar. you know? because i feel like i should like this one because it is award-winning, and my experience with the african-american novel is middling (although i love the african novel, the west indian novel and the afro-canadian novel - go figure) so i feel like as someone who appreciates literature in general, i should totally love this. but it wasn't there for me. oh, chris wilson, i am sorry. now you are going to want full custody because your baby is being raised among heathens. years from now, when my and chris wilson's book-baby became the mayor of littleton, he would read this review and a tear of sorrow would come to his eye at my short-sightedness. come to my blog!"

        "text":"I know this is a critically acclaimed book, a Pulitzer winner, and a book tackling a difficult and complex stain on America history: slavery and black slave owners. There are moments when the book does say some interesting things or reveal some unsavory and uncomfortable truths, but it was so hard to engage with as a reader. I mean, I hung in with DFW through the first 600 pages of Infinite Jest where nothing happens -- but because I was fascinated by Hal, Orin, Marathe, Steeply, and Mario and Madame Psychosis who all fascinated me. There were literally dozens of other characters but these all pulled me in. In The Known World, there are also dozens of characters but none that I grew any attachment too. It was as if the author Jones was using a hand-held camera and no stabilizer so that the images were jumpy and out of focus. It reminded me sometimes of how the world seems to my myopic eyes between taking off my glasses in the morning and putting in my contact lenses. The narration also highly annoyed me. All the parenthetical \"in 60 years so and so will do such as such\" were meaningless because I was given neither enough time nor enough detail to give a shit. Further, there is this reference to \"years later they would all turn into human torches in front of the dry foods store\", but no mention afterwards of to what this referred. But the most annoying bit was in using the Canadian journalist frame at about page 130 or so (which then only briefly appears in the narrative 200 pages later in a parenthetical throwaway comment, it is said that the journalist would never marry his heart's desire yet 3 pages later, they marry and that coming to talk to Fern that there was some incomprehensible stuff that happens off-screen that morning (also never adequately explained) and so she was not going to open up to the journalist and yet we still find her filling in details about Henry, Moses and Caledonia 30 pages later. Too much inconsistency - was the editor asleep or stoned and missed these? So, despite taking on a complex subject, Jones is no Faulkner as his South does not eve approach that of the Great William. He is not as good as Pynchon or DFW is manipulating time and space in a narrative that was 100 or 150 pages too long and felt it, and he is not Alice Walker or Toni Morrison who brought us the most amazing, poignant, and powerful images of slavery and its residual impacts generations later that I have ever read. So, read Beloved or Absalom, Absalom if you want to hear about the South and I expect you will be less frustrated, but every bit enraged at this deplorable institution that is a cancer on the American past."

        "text":"Ambitious, Interesting, Disorganized In an interview, Edward P. Jones revealed that The Known World took shape around 1) when he heard that Black people had owned slaves and 2) when he read a thin paperback in high school about a Jewish man who decided to join the Nazi party, how he acted in opposition to how one would expect. The Known World is an ambitious novel which aims to describe the world of 1855 where Henry Townsend has recently died. As a result of his death, a cloud of uncertainty hangs in the air as he leaves behind his widow, Caldonia, and the undetermined fate of the slaves he purchased to work his land. Although the plot is interesting, this book is disorganized. It covers many different characters and rapidly shifts time periods. I would be reading along and then the text would say “and this person lived to be 93 years old and had 235 grandchildren.” (paraphrasing) Countless times, I had to stop and reread because the storytelling was so clunky. In The Known World, there are quite a few references to Adam and Eve, even references to Milton (Paradise Lost). My favorite author, Philip Pullman, loves to talk about this topic and how in his works he wanted his characters to find their way back to The Garden by taking the long way around. So this quote on page 329 stood out: “There was a long way around but he chose not to take it.” There is a character in The Known World by the name of Anderson Frazier. He creates and distributes pamphlets and interviews Fern Elston. In my opinion, this pamphlet could have provided a framework to systematically organize the characters instead of the resulting jumbled and confusing soup of characters and timelines. The Known World has some unforgettable moments, but the organization of the narrative reduces the enjoyment of the reading experience.

        "text":"This is a complex novel, with dense writing, a non-linear structure, and an abundance of characters. It reads much like a true historical account of a place, Manchester County, Virginia, and time, pre-Civil War 1800s. This could very nearly have passed for a non-fiction book; each character feels so real, their personal stories and histories so authentic. The author even goes so far as to tell us what happens to many of them ten, twenty or even fifty years in the future. And yet, Edward P. Jones himself states: \"The county and town of Manchester, Virginia, and every human being in those places, are products of my imagination… The census records I made up for Manchester were, again, simply to make the reader feel that the town and the county and the people lived and breathed in central Virginia once upon a time…\" Well, consider me duped. At first I really thought such a county existed and the data presented were genuine facts. As my son passed through the living room, I even shouted out some sort of statistic or another and asked if he had ever read about such a thing in his history classes. He couldn’t recall, but it sounded ‘familiar’. Right, because much of this could have been true, yet it wasn’t. The institution of slavery of course was all too real and cruel, and that’s what this book is about, and this is the truth. Slavery in all its forms is evil. Henry Townsend is a black farmer. He is a former slave that with the purchase of freedom and some land becomes a slave owner himself. Henry and his wife Caldonia own a small plantation near the border of his former master’s much larger one. I could not wrap my head around why on earth a freed man would ever want to enslave another human being. Henry and other black slave owners like him justify their actions: \"Henry had always said that he wanted to be a better master than any white man he had ever known. He did not understand that the kind of world he wanted to create was doomed before he had even spoken the first syllable of the word master.\" Well, as the old saying goes, ‘the road to hell is paved with good intentions.’ When Henry dies, all hell breaks loose, and we begin to see the ill-fated consequences of an institution that is immoral and corrupt. A narrative that seems to jump around in time and between characters eventually comes together into a whole as consequences and events snowball out of control. Lives are permanently changed. Some for the worst, others (we hope) for the better. They all become woven together much like the massive tapestry hanging on the wall of another place in another time. Each is part of the story. Everyone is responsible for the events which passed, were allowed to pass despite the huge injustice to humanity. This book is not easy to read. The structure is challenging and the topic is gloomy, albeit important. What happens to the people we grow to care for is often horrifying and heartbreaking. But it is well-written and extremely impactful. An important novel which is well worth your time and attention if you are up for the challenge. It won't suit everyone, but if you are at all interested, I encourage you to pick this one up. \"What I feared most at that moment is what I still fear: that they would remember my history, that I, no matter what I had always said to the contrary, owned people of our Race.\""

I really thought when we got together that we would have a brief but mutually satisfying relationship. I'd read you, you'd provide enlightenment or emotional catharsis or entertainment, maybe even all three. All the signs were there: the laudatory quotes on your jacket, a shocking and unexpected premise, high marks on goodreads. But something was just off by the end of the first chapter. Maybe it was the masturbation scene right at the start. Or the characters that I just couldn't get into - I could hardly tell some of them apart. Or the way the narrative seemed to skip all over without any focus. Maybe I just didn't give you enough pages. I'm sure you got better as you went along. I mean, look at all the four- and five-star reviews you've gotten! But every time I picked you up my thoughts turned to the three other books on my bedside table that I'd rather be reading.

        "text":"There’s irony that I read more than half of this wrenching, ugly, hopeful, stirring, and grievous book while holding a sleeping baby in my arms. Because there is a lot of life and death in this take on pre-Civil War Virginia. I knew little about the book except that the author wrote it after reading about freed Black folks owning slaves. In delving into this issue, which in any modern conversation circle must bring dissonance, disbelief, and maybe even disgust, I became increasingly moved and disturbed. A difficult book, both because it’s an unflinching look at slavery, but also because it’s written in a James Joyce-ish style — lots of asides and stream of consciousness text. The author careens from generation to generation and back again in often the same paragraph. Yet it worked for me. It reads like a memoir of an entire county’s 150-year history complete with dozens of families represented. What results is simply, UNFORGETTABLE. There are characters whose faces I imagined while reading and characters whose stories I became invested in that will haunt me. Not in the truth of a fictional characterization but more because the ugliness of humanity was so blatantly on display and sadly remains real to this day. As I bid farewell to the slaves, slaveowners, children of both and ministers, sheriffs and patrollers of this novel, I will not forget their names. And I can’t help but wonder who would I have been in Manchester County, Virginia? (Reviewed 2\/12\/25)"

        "text":"I'm going to have to rave a bit, because this is one of the best books I've read in the past ten years. Jones packs in all the historical detail you could want, and of course he's hit on a subject--black slaveowners--that in and of itself is tabloid-sensational. Where lesser writers might lean too hard on the sensational aspect (or rely on it to bolster an otherwise weak narrative), Jones works it into a compelling and powerful story. What makes it so powerful is a mix of fascinating characters who are woven into a series of overlapping plotlines. For me it's the structuring that is so brilliant (geek alert: I actually diagrammed the time shifts in the chapters as an exercise, to see when and how Jones yoked the whole thing together). This less than linear approach might be frustrating to those who just want things to be straightforward, but stick with it: the shifts provide suspense as well as texture, and they propel more than one storyline at once. They do all come together, trust me. I also admire the overarching authorial voice in the novel, which certainly leans toward the formal, but also comes across as aware of the history it's grappling with: here and there Jones projects his voice forward for a moment, or seemingly digresses with factual material and research. Again it's all part of the tapestry and the mix, and I also think that the level of narrative awareness (which never disengages long enough to derail anything) adds another layer to the very idea of history--making the whole historical and contemporary both. And for those of you who can do without all of the above writerly blather (a thousand pardons), you'll find in this book characters who are engaging, ignorant, cruel, earnest, sympathetic, tragic, hopeful, flawed--in short, complicated. Halfway through you'll be fighting off the impulse to skip ahead to learn everyone's fate. Finally, I'll say that this book isn't perfect--there are aspects of what I've described above that sometimes don't work: narrative turns that do seem pointless digressions, a character or two a bit stereotypical or annoying. No matter. This book aims high, as brilliant works of art do, and the result is nothing short of amazing."

        "text":"This book demands that you read it slowly and intently. Like eating a huge Thanksgiving dinner, you need to pause and digest before you have the next course. At the outset, the plot seems to be all over the place, bouncing from character to character, telling too many stories, not telling enough and then seeming to tell too much. Ah, but then, you make a little progress and the rhythm begins to assert itself, the stories begin to weave together, the minute details begin to become a diorama, the picture stops being a blur and comes into sharp focus. This isn’t one man’s story, or even the story of one place, this is the story of all men and this is the tale of a world. This book is not so much about race as it is about the abject insanity and evil of the institution of slavery, wherever it is found, whoever is practicing it. In this system, there are free black masters holding black slaves, some of them well-meaning, but it does not make the practice any less immoral. There are white men who love their black mistresses and the children they bear, but it does not remove the fact that they hold a dominion over them that is not borne of love in any of its guises. There are also individuals who are victims of the system and others who refuse to be victims of the system, even at the cost of their lives. I loved many of Jones’ characters, notably Augustus and Mildred Townsend. They exemplify what is the best in us. I felt sorry for some of them, like Sheriff John Skiffington, who would like to be better than this society allows him to be, and Caldonia Townsend’s brother, Calvin, who wishes to go to New York so that he will not have to bear witness to the cruelties around him, cruelties he must realized have escaped him only because of a trick of fortune. I despised some of them, and I recognized most of them. The petty and jealous, who must have dominion over someone to feel they have worth; the ungrateful and traitorous, who would turn upon a friend to put some silver in their own pockets; the meek and hopeless, who bow to the yoke and try simply to find a corner in which they are allowed to exist; the defiant and strong-minded, who fight with their last breath because to do otherwise is to prop up the indefensible; all are here. What I loved most about this novel is its genuineness, its lack of exaggeration or hyperbole, where surely none is needed, its emphasis on the day-to-day injustice of an institution that is accepted as insurmountable or even correct only because it is what is. Edward P. Jones has leveled an attack at the heart of mankind and defied one to imagine what they would have done, what they would have dared to do, in such a place and time."

        "text":"A very complex and beautiful, compelling book about Henry, a former slave who becomes a slave owner, & his wife Caldonia. But they're just the start - the book is really a series of stories & vignettes about the families, friends, neighbors & community surrounding Henry & Caldonia. It took me a really long time to get into the book, because there are so many characters, some important & some not, & the book jumps around in time, making it difficult to follow. Trust me, use the cast of characters at the end of this edition (why not place this at the beginning?!) & give up your expectations about traditional narrative format, & you'll LOVE this book as much as I did. In life, we have our own story kind of playing in our head, & at the same time we have all these other stories we're hearing - the story about your mother's great-uncle. The story about your brother in law's neighbor. The one about your sister's husband's aunt & her neighbor. the one about your coworker's mother. You know all those stories? That's what this book is like - some characters are more important than others, so you hear more of their stories, but minor characters have stories too, & they sort of appear out of nowhere, & you get to hear their story, & then they're gone. It's really very cool! I particularly loved the story of the womanizing slave who has a vision during a lightning storm\/tornado - & becomes the founder of an orphanage. And the little tiny story about the family who don't want to give up their cow, & the woman goes into the barn to milk the cow & there's this lovely description of her squirting the cow's milk into a cat's mouth, & if you've ever seen a cat eat with true contentment you will recognize the cat body language that Jones describes. Toward the end of the book there's a very powerful scene where a character, who isn't a particularly \"good\" character, says there should be a lantern or light of truth in the world, an actual place where people can stand & tell the truth without fear of retribution, where one might be able to right a wrong. It's a moment where you think, yes this guy could right the wrong by speaking out, because his fear of having people think he's \"on the negro's side\" is...well, wrong! But that's his fear & in that moment of the book you understand it & you think, yeah, what if he could speak out under that light of truth & not have anyone judge him? How wonderful would that be? While the book depicts the horrors of slavery, & there are a few characters who are outright despicable, there are many shades of gray in Jones' vision as well. It's a book that will make you think about slavery, the myths & realities & tragedies of it all, & on top of that it'll make you think about your own life & all the people you've known & how complex & interesting we all are, really. It's beautifully written & the characters will stick in your head as if you'd known them too. Oddly, I think what I initially disliked most about this book - its multitude of characters & convoluted timeline - is what I ended up really enjoying! Another example of a book that made my head expand, with some creakiness, but I'm glad the expansion can still happen!"

        "text":"In this book I learned that there used to be black slaveholders in the US. I thought that only white people were allowed to own slaves during the time that owning slaves were like owning properties. During that pre-Abolition time. During those sad dark days in the American history. Black Edward P. Jones (born 1951) wrote this historical epic novel, The Known World based on the not well known fact that there were some black slaveholders (black people owning black slaves) in the state of Virginia during the time in the US when owning slave is legal. Wikipedia has this to say: \"Slavery in the United States was a form of unfree labor which existed as a legal institution in North America for more than a century before the founding of the United States in 1776, and continued mostly in the South until the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution in 1865.[1] The first English colony in North America, Virginia, first imported Africans in 1619, a practice earlier established in the Spanish colonies as early as the 1560s.[2] Most slaves were black and were held by whites, although some Native Americans and free blacks also held slaves; there were a small number of white slaves as well.[3]\" Winner of the 2004 Pulitzer Award for Fiction, The Known World is one of the most memorable reads I had this year. It is not an easy book to read. This 388-page novel left me with a heavy chest each time I closed the book. Each page is gloomy and sad. The novel is well-told with lyrical prose creating a big canvas of imagery in one's mind while reading. In that big canvas are memorable and three-dimensional numerous characters most of them black slaves. No character is downright bad or good. The detailed description of the sceneries of a fictional county called Manchester and the true depictions of the characters are exceptionally striking that I had to slow down in my reading to savor the story and hold on *tugging to them, cheering them on* to each characters. Reading the last page left me with a heavy heart. I would not want to let go of that image of Manchester and say goodbye Please don't go yet to the characters that I already became part of my literary world. The world that resides in the recesses of my brain. The world that is known only to me populated by people who I met only in my readings. In terms of writing, Jones extensively use the technique called prolepsis that I first encountered reading Muriel Sparks' The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie (1961). Jones explained this in the interview (appendix of the book) saying that he is the God of those characters so he knows what happened in the life of each characters from the time he\/she was born up to the time his\/her death. The most moving example of this use was with the character of the child Tessie . One fine day of September 1855, their mistress Caldonia saw the 5-y\/o Tessie playing with a wooden toy horse. Caldonia says to the child: That is very nice, Tessie to which Tessie responded, My papa did this for me . In January 2002, on her deathbed, the old Tessie asked her caretaker to get the wooden toy horse from the attic. While holding the toy, she breathed her last saying the same thing: My papa did this for me . My heart stopped beating. Tears welled up in my eyes. That scene is just one of the many moving scenes about those slaves in that time of the history in Virginia when black people were traded like they were not human but properties. I can make this review very long. There are just too many good things I would like to say here but I am afraid that no review can make justice to a book as good as this."

Free blacks owned other black people. Some free blacks bought their family members and others just wanted the slave labor. Native Americans owned slaves for much of the same reasons. The Known World introduces us to some of those people. The Known World has won a whole gang of awards, so we know its an important book and the writing is top notch. My only problems with the book were the fact that there were too many characters. You know this is a pet peeve of mine and I lost track of all the characters in this book. My other problem was that it jumped backwards and forwards in time way too much. Most of the time jumps were super confusing. I liked The Known World but I think I might not be smart enough to read this book. I'll probably reread it sometime in the future and I do recommend to others because its a brilliant book."

Wyatt Mason notes : What research on the subject Jones undertook was, in fact, quickly derailed after he happened upon an account of a white slave owner who spent her days abusing one of her black slaves, a little girl, by beating her head against a wall. “If I had wanted to tell the whole story of slavery, Americans couldn’t have taken that,” Jones told an interviewer. “People want to think that there was slavery, and then we got beyond it. People don’t want to hear that a woman would take a child and bang her head against the wall day after day. It’s nice that I didn’t read all those books. What I would have had to put down is far, far harsher and bleaker. Too much of a bummer? It's not that The Known World is a feel-good novel. Ears and Achilles tendons will be sliced. It follows the rules of slavery books: slave narratives always had happy endings; later, fictional slave narratives always have sad endings. But Toni Morrison has a different opinion about what Americans can and can't take. Shit, so does Harriet Jacobs. And Jones knows this, so he's being disingenuous. And you notice that he's talking about books he didn't actually read. NPR says, Jones collected two shelves of books about slavery, but never got around to reading them. Still, the author was able to use his imagination, and stories he had heard growing up, to make his characters come alive. \"I decided the people I'd created were real enough and I had just accumulated enough information about what the world was like in the South before 1865 to allow me to lie and get away with it,\" he says. Look, I don't mean to say Jones isn't telling the truth. I don't know if he is, and neither does he; neither of us read those two shelves of books about slavery. But the citation of imaginary sources in the book itself serves to either add authenticity that's undeserved, or - if you follow up on those sources - underline its lack of authenticity. I'm puzzled by it. This sort of meta-sourcing has been done before - by Nabokov in Pale Fire, by Cervantes, and in its closest parallel by Borges in his first collection, Universal History of Iniquity, which also confused me. It's especially jarring here, maybe just because I find the truth of slavery a fraught subject, and maybe because the layers go so deep - even in interviews about his lack of authenticity, he appears to be consciously inauthentic. I don't know, man, I don't get it. But anyway: is it a good made-up story about made-up people? Yeah, sure, totally. Eventually. The first half is a little annoying. There's a lot of chronological foofarah - skipping all over the place for no pressing reason - and a ginormous cast it's hard to keep track of, and our super-omniscient narrator often takes time out to tell you some trivial character's entire life story, which you didn't really need. But the second half ratchets up the tension to pure shit-your-pantsville, as that sprawling cast all meet their assorted fates. It makes up for some irritation in the first half. So yeah, as a novel it's excellent. The authenticity issue, I bring up mostly because we take this book seriously; it won a Pulitzer. It deserves to be looked carefully at. I looked carefully and I was confused by its truth."

        "text":"Despite some luminous moments where the characters come alive in a special way, this novel about the lives of slaves in a fictional community in Virginia of the 1830s felt too hermetic and sealed off for me to enjoy it as thoroughly as others might. The special hook that the story holds is its rendering of freed blacks who became slave owners themselves. The focus is on one such plantation with about 30 slaves which is struggling to adapt to the death of its black master, Henry Townsend. We get a plausible history along the way of how his father, Augustus, was so talented at furniture making that he bought his own freedom, and state legislative action allowed him to continue residing in the state and eventually bought the freedom of his son. With other free blacks, such as the feisty, condescending teacher Fern, who came from the North, they form a small society of their own. While Augustus abhors slavery, his son tries to emulate the path taken by the whites to economic success by owning slaves. Despite an ambition to become a benevolent master, the corrupting influence of owning people as property is well portrayed. When his lonely widow takes up a love relationship with her plantation foreman, she is replicating the same abuse of power enacted by most other white plantation owners, and the consequences are tragic. The “known world” of plantation life in this fictional county is like an island in time, and the characters themselves seem stuck in it like insects in amber. The omniscient narrator is god-like in passing into the thoughts and dreams of more than a dozen characters. Unfortunately, the reader gets distanced from emotionally connecting to them by the narrator breaking the flow to leap backward and forward in time to reveal some particular fact or person’s fate (for more see: D.D. Wood review ). Ultimately, the human bonds holding people to each other came off as tenuous and unreal as beholding a ship in a bottle. Unlike the romanticized lives portrayed in Hailey’s “Roots”, the characters have no sense of cultural history of their African origins (the word itself appears nowhere in the book), and there is no foreshadowing of plantation life as a doomed phase in history on the path to the Civil War. The idea of a slave revolt is unthinkable, and the one humane white character, Sheriff Skiffington, feels no compunction over diligently carrying out a big part of his job in organizing night patrols and retrieval efforts when “property” runs away. Though we get no sense of the reality of the “Underground Railroad”, we do get a brilliant vision at one point where Augustus ends up mailing a slave girl to Philadelphia in a crate along with a shipment of his hand-carved walking sticks. In an interview with Jones appended to the audiobook version of the novel, he admits he did not do much research for the book and was not concerned about communicating any particular message to his readers about the history of slavery. As the creator of all the characters, he would not admit to favoring any one character over another. Still the reader can’t help but getting the message of how inhumane slavery was and how individuals trapped in it strived to achieve some form of dignity in their lives. Like other reviewers, I didn’t feel I got to know any of the characters well enough to get emotionally engaged with them. When not interrupted by invasions from the narrator, the prose is effective in evoking the place and time, an obvious factor in helping it gain a Pulitzer Prize. Here is a lovely example from the opening for the book: The evening his master dies he worked again well after he ended the day for the other adults, his own wife among them, and sent them back with hunger and tiredness to their cabins. The young ones, his son among them, had been sent out of the fields an hour or so before the adults, to prepare the late supper and, if there was time enough, to play in a few minutes of sun that were left. When he, Moses, finally freed himself of the ancient and brittle harness that connected him to the oldest mule his master owned, all that was left of the sun was a five-inch long memory of red orange laid out in still waves across the horizon between two mountains on the left and one on the right. He had been in the fields for all of fourteen hours. He paused before leaving the fields as the evening quiet wrapped itself about him. The mule quivered, wanting home and rest. Moses closed his eyes and bent down and took a pinch of the soil and ate it with no more thought than if it were a spot of cornbread. …he ate it not only to discover the strengths and weaknesses of the field, but because eating it tied him to the only thing in his small world that meant almost as much as his own life."

        "text":"Glorious account that gets past cliches. The premise is that two slaves in 1840s Virginia bought their freedom, but their son stayed a little too long under the master's care. What does the family do when the son starts his own farm and buys his own slaves? The mastery of Jones' writing comes in the sense of history that he lends to minute objects, chance encounters, and incantatory reveries within a frought landscape. Not content to write an unwritten history of forgotten people, Jones re-writes the histories that have been written, citing documents the purport to explain the historical phenomenon of free blacks who owned slaves. Passages that carry runaway characters to the north also tie in academic treatises from the next century, deeds and warrants and court decisions that attempted to justify white supremacy, and the momentoes that emancipated children carry to their deathbeds. Jones doesn't neglect to include tales of individual transformation, collective redemption, or international implications in this epic. Characters may come and go like fleeting ghosts, yet the marks they leave may remain. When the words of the plantation master and deeds of the escaped overseer have faded into ineffectual memory, we readers are left with both the sense that an institution has gone horribly wrong and that the people within it can be honorably right; even if the results remain unapparent, the promise of future change remains, along with the threat of complacency and neglect. Jones didn't attempt to detail the national debate over slavery that was current at that time. That limitation on his project was probably a good one. It allows us to see the human effects that rhetoric had covered, and allowed him to devote his attentions to demonstrating the range of positions that people could occupy in relation to the institution. Yes, whether you're descended from a slave, a master, a freed man, a black woman passing as white, an unwilling overseer, a treacherous deputy, a conscientious drunk, or an immigrant Irishwoman sold into prostitution, there's something in this book for you - and I wish that I was only joking, but the irony is that there is no irony here, and sincerity is the least of what we have to do, and memory is only the start of making a history that hasn't stopped."

        "text":"Set in antebellum Virginia, a former slave, Henry Townsend, owns fifty acres of land and thirty-three slaves. As the story opens, Townsend is dying. The novel chronicles his life, the lives of his family members, and the lives of people he encountered in the community. The main characters are three-dimensional and feel like real people, with both admirable traits and flaws. Jones employs an omniscient narrator and non-linear storytelling. He weaves together overlapping stories of past and present events, such that the reader knows what happens to these people in the future before knowing what has happened to them in the book’s “present.” There are a great many characters in this book and the list of Dramatis Personae is helpful in keeping them all straight. This novel is based on a lesser known historical fact. While it was not common, it did happen that some free blacks owned slaves. It lends a complexity to the slavery narrative – showing how people can be impacted by society’s strictures and how victims of exploitation could become perpetrators of the same system. This is not a quick and easy read. It feels like being immersed in the life and times of Manchester County, Virginia, in the 1850s. It is an eloquently written condemnation of oppression in any form. This book won the Pulitzer Prize in 2004."

        "text":"2.5-stars, really. here is a perfect example of a books i should love, and yet.... i didn't. the book was a lot of work and, for me, very little reward. i think most of my issues are because of the style\/structure of the novel: * the third-person, omniscient narrator - this was distracting from very early on in the read. i held off judging it. i wanted to trust jones and his choice. * non-linear narrative - i don't tend to have problems with this at all, but i found it super-clunky here. also distracting. * the made-up references - jones would cite sources and details that seemed to lend such an air of gravitas, but none of it is actually real. (i know, i know. this is fiction. a novel. get over it. but it was just kinda weird to me. social commentary inserted into fiction happens. steinbeck did it. teju cole does it. many writers do this. i felt like jones did a crap-ton of research for this book. but then i read this NPR piece . in it, he notes he collected 2 shelves worth of books on slavery... \"but never got around to reading them\" . so this just added to my 'what the?' on the references in the novel and jones' research.) * all of this combined for a really awkward flow, and convoluted storytelling. i felt like it could lose 50-100 pages and be a tighter, better story. in case you think maybe i am a lazy reader - i'm not, i swear! i love nothing more than a meaty, tough read. jones' story is definitely both of these things. he explores the issue of free black people owning slaves in virginia, and he gives us a large cast of active characters. but it all felt so... surface-y. we get the actions and reactions, but we don't really get the motivations or emotions. jones is navigating a morally dodgy landscape, one i would have loved to have gone into more deeply. we are given the horrors and the heartbreaks, but it all felt so detached. and, you know, maybe that is totally on purpose. maybe, for some people, detachment is the only way through such a horrible time in history. jones has collected some serious critical acclaim and recognition over his career. to name a few: he's won the pulitzer, the national book critic's circle award, the PEN\/Hemingway award, a MacArthur genius grant, and the International IMPAC dublin literary award. he's won nearly $1 million in literary awards alone. the man knows what he's doing, and the respect he's earned is fairly universal. the known world is an important story. but is just shining the light on the issues jones raises enough? so now i am back to the should . i should love this book. (it was just okay for me.) people should read this book. (indeed. but this is not a book i will blanket recommend to all.) so, i don't know you guys. i am bummed over this one. and this is a terrible review\/collection of thoughts. maybe i'll become more coherent with some distance and fix this up a bit - but for now i wanted to note down something here. (aside #1 (going to be a bit spoiler-y here): moses confused me. or, rather, his turn to all-of-a-sudden being an asshole was weird. we're going along with moses. he seems like a lovely man. then, halfway into the book, he's a wife-beater, jerkface? where did that come from, and why was he presented like that? the reveal of moses being a not nice man was sudden and odd.) (aside #2: worth noting (was hugely interesting to me) - the cover photo of this edition is © Eudora Welty ! i had no idea about her photographic prowess .)"

        "text":"Here is a book about black slave owners in the antebellum South! My interest was immediately piqued. On top of that, the book has won all sorts of prizes: *Pulitzer Prize for Fiction (2004) *International Dublin Literary Award (2005) *Anisfield-Wolf Book Award (2004) *National Book Critics Circle Award for Fiction (2003) * Hurston\/Wright Legacy Award Nominee for Debut Fiction (\/2004 *National Book Award Finalist for Fiction (2003) I knew I had to give it a try. I am glad I have read it, but to say I like it, would just not be true. It’s OK, so I am giving it two stars. There is no real central character to the story, because he dies right off the bat. It is 1855 when Henry Townsend dies. He is black. He had been a slave, but his parents had bought him his freedom. He leaves behind no children but a wife, Caldonia, a twenty-eight-year-old educated black woman born free, and his property of thirty-three slaves and fifty acres in Manchester County, Virginia. The book is about the hell that breaks loose afterwards, but really what it is about is life in the South during the antebellum era, about the mindset of Blacks and Whites of this era. The story is told by an omniscient narrator—who knows how each character thinks, what has happened to all of them in the past and what will happen to all of them in the future. It is this all-seeing narrator that shapes the entire feel of the story. This narrator knows everything, but he is not particularly adept at cogently telling a story. In one sentence you may switch form the present to the future and back again. In the next sentence you flip back to the past. It is easy to become confused. Character upon character is thrown at you, with little tidbits about their lives in the past, present and future. You are given an entire community of individuals—Whites and Blacks, a Native American or two, those who are free and those who are slaves, a sheriff and his deputy. The omniscient narrator is constantly restating who each one is, which is good in one sense, but the flow of the tale becomes jerky. Stop and start, backward and forward and often confusing. Use of the omniscient narrator is pushed to the extreme. It is kind of nice to have a character or two to guide you through a story. You do not have that here. There are a whole group of characters, characters that are hard to attach yourself to. You do not get close to any one individual. In the afterword the author points out that he wanted to draw characters that were neither all good nor all bad, each one different in their own way. You do get that here, but you fail to feel anything for any of them. What you do get is a strong sense of being one of a large community. You are there, one among many, living in the antebellum South. This does give one a hands-on feeling of life then and there and how people were thinking. Kevin Free narrates the audiobook. It is simple to follow, the speed is fine and he intonations are well done. The narration performance is good so I have given the narration three stars."

        "text":"I attended a workshop with some friends during which we all went around the room and recommended books that really moved us that year. I don't remember which book I suggested then, but I recall one woman in particular who really loved this book (or I believe she was more in love with Edward Jones' writing). At the end of the workshop we had a gift exchange raffle and she included this book as her contribution. I was the lucky recipient of this free copy. I was interested in this historical novel set in a fictional place in Virginia during the antebellum era, about a former slave who ends up owning slaves. The strangeness of the story and the angle it takes as a slave narrative is intriguing. Also appealing is the way the omniscient narration allows the reader to approach the story without the moral judgement one reserves for this kind of story, since the distance of the narration allows one to realize quickly what the story tries to showcase: how slavery has already poisoned the integrity of all involved. The framework of the novel is composed of anecdotal stories within stories, with pacing often interrupted for a mini scene or two, or an introduction of yet another character who may reappear later or simply disappear. Put another way, it is a book of puzzle pieces: one is added, taken away, another picked up, oh yes, there's the whole, whoops, maybe not, here goes another piece. So although I admired the writing and story setup in the beginning, I just was not in the right space to complete this novel. It has been a while since I added a book to my \"did-not-finish\" list; alas, this one has just made the list. This is not a failed attempt at reading this novel, however, because I remember not being able to finish Ngugi wa Thiong'o's Wizard of the Crow only to later fall in love with his novel, Petals of Blood . With that in mind, I look forward to reading Jones' Lost in the City ."

While not exactly removing race from the issue of slavery, Jones is able to show that even among African-Americans the perniciousness of slavery could damn a generation. The best summary of this idea came from a NYTimes review: 'There are few certified villains in this novel, white or black, because slavery poisons moral judgments at the root. As Jones shows, slavery corrupts good intentions and underwrites bad ones, yet allows decency the odd occasion -- but only by creating such an enormous need for it.' The pacing and structure of this novel could be a little challenging to some, but I found that it fit the narrative perfectly. This isn't a novel that burns you with its quotable sentences, but it scars you with its images. There were periods in it where I thought I was reading a Cormac McCarthy novel. That alone is high praise."

        "text":"When Toni Morrison began her research for \"Beloved,\" she discovered a trove of ghastly instruments. She knew, of course, that slaves were routinely whipped, starved, raped, and hanged, but the existence of specially forged tools was a surprise: metal bits forced down the throat, iron masks locked across the face, spiked collars clasped around the neck. Her Pulitzer Prize-winning novel reintroduced those horrors into the national memory and did much to demonstrate that the cruelties of slavery extended far beyond hard labor and physical deprivation. \"The Known World,\" by Edward Jones, reclaims another peculiarity of American slavery and in the process illustrates yet again that we can't under- estimate its perverse contortions of the human spirit. Bizarre as it sounds, in Louisiana, Virginia, and South Carolina, a small number of free blacks owned their own plantations - and their own slaves. It was a precarious arrangement, to be sure. Blacks who were freed or managed to buy their own freedom had little incentive to tarry in the South. The laws governing their status and their right to hold property were ambiguous and easy for any white person to shred. Jones uses this fragile situation as the setting for a novel about a group of black and white Virginians who tried - sometimes nobly, often viciously - to maintain their world in the face of inevitable collapse. To the extent that Morrison spun a surreal tale of American slavery into mythic proportions, Jones has carved a companion series of stark anecdotes into national legends. In a measured voice that never rises to reflect the agonies and absurdities he describes, he moves back and forth through decades and across state lines, assembling an apparently random collection of brief scenes that gradually fuse into a stunning portrait of moral confusion. The story revolves around Henry Townsend, a black man who, with the indulgence of his former owner, managed to buy his own farm and his own slaves - eventually 29 adults and a collection of children. Henry's parents, who labored tirelessly to free him as a child, are horrified by his participation in the flesh market, but Henry is ambitious, and, what's more, he learned from his master that \"once you own even one, you will never be alone.\" As a protection against loneliness and a way to wealth, Henry can't imagine anything more successful, and he's convinced he can be \"a better master than any white man he had ever known.\" Indeed, he attains that dubious goal, creating a plantation with forced labor that's largely free of physical beatings, but it's an insidious gentility that only camouflages the humiliations of Southern slavery. Nevertheless, his untimely death frightens most of his slaves, who know just how delicate their relative comfort is. Only the brooding overseer, Moses, the first slave Henry ever bought, sees his master's demise as an opportunity - not for freedom, but for taking his place. Indeed, what interests Jones most in this complex novel is the way slavery distorts judgment, not just of those who oppress, but of those who are oppressed. Henry's widow, Caldonia, quickly decides against freeing \"her legacy,\" choosing instead to maintain the plantation in the spirit of Henry's gentle example. \"Her husband had done the best he could,\" she thinks, \"and on Judgment Day his slaves would stand before God and testify to that fact.\" Occasionally, a child is worked to death or a pregnant woman labors in the field till she miscarries, but Caldonia sheds sincere tears, comforts the parents, and considers whether she should buy insurance against further losses of her property. As a single woman with a large business to run, she's encouraged by a collection of family and friends, other free blacks, some of whom own their own slaves, too. One of the most troubling is Fern, Caldonia's prim teacher of literature and etiquette. Together, they keep the irony of their position well buried, while socializing in a kind of racial terrarium maintained by William Robbins, the county's wealthiest white farmer. Estranged from his own wife but protected by his political power, he loves a black woman in town and openly adores his two mulatto children. The Townsend plantation with its little coterie of free slave-owning blacks gives his favorites a place to play and refine themselves. In one of several shifts to the late 19th century, a Canadian historian interviews Fern, Caldonia's teacher, about those days on the plantation. \"All of us do only what the law and God tell us we can do,\" she says without any hint of guilt or remorse. \"We owned slaves. It was what was done, and so that is what we did.\" Jones uses that same tone of historical distance throughout, a tone that amplifies the grotesque mingling of affection and cruelty that infected these people, black and white. In the center of this moral kaleidoscope stands the sheriff, John Skiffington, an earnest Christian, dedicated to the objective application of law and convinced that \"the law always cares\" for everyone equally. It's a doomed endeavor, of course, but as Caldonia's plantation begins to collapse, Skiffington fails to realize that the legal system he's sworn to uphold is not objective and that he cannot remain clean within it. The scrambled collection of events and characters makes this a difficult story to enter, but that structure eventually accounts for much of the novel's evocative power. Jones has a kind of biblical style that suggests whole lives in a few stark details from a perspective that's alternately microscopic and telescopic. It's a technique that resists our efforts to keep these events in some unrecoverable past. The troubling implications of his story leach in through hairline cracks all over the twin shells of antebellum nostalgia and Northern piety. Every time Caldonia cheerfully reminds her friends, \"We are all worthy of one another,\" the legacy of slavery sounds more complex and unresolved. http:\/\/www.csmonitor.com\/2003\/0814\/p1..."

        "text":"Manchester County, Virginia doesn't exist. Never has. After reading The Known World, however, you'd be forgiven if you thought you could take a tour of it's plantations and slave cemetaries on your vacation to colonial Williamsburg. The complicated pre-civil war Southern society that Edward P. Jones creates feels as real and surreal as any factual history of slavery you've read. It was not so much the story of Henry Townsend, a black slave owner, and all the people that his death allows us to meet that engaged me. It was the world, a world where I could taste the soil I might till and the women I might marry and the terrible choices I might be faced with, that put it's claws in me and refused to let go. It took me nearly 2 months to finish the book's 388 pages. It should've been a quick read. It is a fascinating place with peculiar problems and characters I cried for on more than one occasion. It should've been a quick read but I kept asking myself this question: who would I have been? The slave, toiling away in the field? The overseer, unable to see the world for what it truly was? The freed man, working desperately to free the rest of his family? The smart child, taken under the wing of the rich white slave owner and convinced that there was nothing wrong with owning another human being? The broken black man tortured by his family's wealth built on the backs of men and women that look just like me? The slave too proud, too strong, too powerful to let another take his freedom? Who would I have been? Who am I now? In matters of race, there is always that fool's point, usually made by a white person (though not always) that asks,\"why aren't you over it, already? Can't we just let it go?\" It is a way to end an uncomfortable conversation. The reasons don't matter. I know many a person for which the sticky tar baby of race in America is simply a discussion they can't stick their hands in. It is too difficult. Too raw. Too cloudy to be sure that people will remain friends after an honest chat. The way I feel when I read books like The Known World is my answer. No matter how well-adjusted, how integrated, how loving of my fellow man, how multiculti kumbayah I am, I'm not over it. I can't let it go. This fictional world was very real not all that long ago. It's effects still ripple through our every day. The world I know doesn't exist without it. Highly highly recommended."

        "text":"there is that old adage that a good book will tell you how to read it. and i have no idea to whom that should be attributed, only that my undergrad professors seemed to have been born to quote that thought endlessly: in my gothic lit class, my enlightenment class, my victorian lit class... the african and irish lit professors mostly kept their mouths shut on the subject. but the rest - hoo boy - did they love to drag that old chestnut out... and it makes sense, to a certain degree. but this book doesn't tell you how to read it so much as it presents itself to the reader, like a fat man in a speedo lolling around on an undersized towel saying, \"look at me ladies, you like it?? this is what you get!!\" it almost demands that you read it and like it. but i was disobedient. every sentence, every paragraph, seemed to be trying to contain multitudes. and i am a fan of \"thick\" writing, but the manner in which this book presented itself quickly soured on me. there were too many stories or episodes ending with, \"years from now, when celia was on her deathbed, she would think back to her third year of marriage\",in a scene where she has yet to even be married, or right after two characters are introduced to each other, \"this would be the last time they would meet until the hailstorm of aught-six\" - and i am making up all the names and situations here, but you get an idea of the shape of my complaints. it's constant foreshadowing and some of the foreshadowing is just teasing, as the events never come to pass in the novel itself. it's like sitting down to tea with a god in his dotage, rambling and making connections only he can understand; seeing the past and future simultaneously. \"hey, karen, didn't you really like that kjaerstaad trilogy, where he basically did what you are complaining about here??\" yeah, what? so? shut up - isn't it past your bedtime?? yeah, but sure, that's true. but for some reason, it bothered me here. all i wanted was a straightforward linear narrative about a fascinating subject matter: free black men and women who owned slaves. when i read roll of thunder, hear my cry last summer, the whole transition period between slavery and freedom really excited my brainparts. i dunno. and mister jones was a real sweetheart when he came for the new yorker festival and i waited in line to get a book signed for a friend and i really wanted to like it because it seems like a nice fat sprawling sweeping story the way i like, but i just got lost in the names and the timeline and my confusion turned into apathy. it's like this guy you date who seems really perfect - he is smart and looks like gabriel byrne and he dotes on you and everything is fun and on paper it all looks great and you know you should really like him, but he just doesn't make you laugh so you run off and leave him for a rockstar. you know? because i feel like i should like this one because it is award-winning, and my experience with the african-american novel is middling (although i love the african novel, the west indian novel and the afro-canadian novel - go figure) so i feel like as someone who appreciates literature in general, i should totally love this. but it wasn't there for me. oh, chris wilson, i am sorry. now you are going to want full custody because your baby is being raised among heathens. years from now, when my and chris wilson's book-baby became the mayor of littleton, he would read this review and a tear of sorrow would come to his eye at my short-sightedness. come to my blog!"

        "text":"I know this is a critically acclaimed book, a Pulitzer winner, and a book tackling a difficult and complex stain on America history: slavery and black slave owners. There are moments when the book does say some interesting things or reveal some unsavory and uncomfortable truths, but it was so hard to engage with as a reader. I mean, I hung in with DFW through the first 600 pages of Infinite Jest where nothing happens -- but because I was fascinated by Hal, Orin, Marathe, Steeply, and Mario and Madame Psychosis who all fascinated me. There were literally dozens of other characters but these all pulled me in. In The Known World, there are also dozens of characters but none that I grew any attachment too. It was as if the author Jones was using a hand-held camera and no stabilizer so that the images were jumpy and out of focus. It reminded me sometimes of how the world seems to my myopic eyes between taking off my glasses in the morning and putting in my contact lenses. The narration also highly annoyed me. All the parenthetical \"in 60 years so and so will do such as such\" were meaningless because I was given neither enough time nor enough detail to give a shit. Further, there is this reference to \"years later they would all turn into human torches in front of the dry foods store\", but no mention afterwards of to what this referred. But the most annoying bit was in using the Canadian journalist frame at about page 130 or so (which then only briefly appears in the narrative 200 pages later in a parenthetical throwaway comment, it is said that the journalist would never marry his heart's desire yet 3 pages later, they marry and that coming to talk to Fern that there was some incomprehensible stuff that happens off-screen that morning (also never adequately explained) and so she was not going to open up to the journalist and yet we still find her filling in details about Henry, Moses and Caledonia 30 pages later. Too much inconsistency - was the editor asleep or stoned and missed these? So, despite taking on a complex subject, Jones is no Faulkner as his South does not eve approach that of the Great William. He is not as good as Pynchon or DFW is manipulating time and space in a narrative that was 100 or 150 pages too long and felt it, and he is not Alice Walker or Toni Morrison who brought us the most amazing, poignant, and powerful images of slavery and its residual impacts generations later that I have ever read. So, read Beloved or Absalom, Absalom if you want to hear about the South and I expect you will be less frustrated, but every bit enraged at this deplorable institution that is a cancer on the American past."

        "text":"Ambitious, Interesting, Disorganized In an interview, Edward P. Jones revealed that The Known World took shape around 1) when he heard that Black people had owned slaves and 2) when he read a thin paperback in high school about a Jewish man who decided to join the Nazi party, how he acted in opposition to how one would expect. The Known World is an ambitious novel which aims to describe the world of 1855 where Henry Townsend has recently died. As a result of his death, a cloud of uncertainty hangs in the air as he leaves behind his widow, Caldonia, and the undetermined fate of the slaves he purchased to work his land. Although the plot is interesting, this book is disorganized. It covers many different characters and rapidly shifts time periods. I would be reading along and then the text would say “and this person lived to be 93 years old and had 235 grandchildren.” (paraphrasing) Countless times, I had to stop and reread because the storytelling was so clunky. In The Known World, there are quite a few references to Adam and Eve, even references to Milton (Paradise Lost). My favorite author, Philip Pullman, loves to talk about this topic and how in his works he wanted his characters to find their way back to The Garden by taking the long way around. So this quote on page 329 stood out: “There was a long way around but he chose not to take it.” There is a character in The Known World by the name of Anderson Frazier. He creates and distributes pamphlets and interviews Fern Elston. In my opinion, this pamphlet could have provided a framework to systematically organize the characters instead of the resulting jumbled and confusing soup of characters and timelines. The Known World has some unforgettable moments, but the organization of the narrative reduces the enjoyment of the reading experience.

        "text":"This is a complex novel, with dense writing, a non-linear structure, and an abundance of characters. It reads much like a true historical account of a place, Manchester County, Virginia, and time, pre-Civil War 1800s. This could very nearly have passed for a non-fiction book; each character feels so real, their personal stories and histories so authentic. The author even goes so far as to tell us what happens to many of them ten, twenty or even fifty years in the future. And yet, Edward P. Jones himself states: \"The county and town of Manchester, Virginia, and every human being in those places, are products of my imagination… The census records I made up for Manchester were, again, simply to make the reader feel that the town and the county and the people lived and breathed in central Virginia once upon a time…\" Well, consider me duped. At first I really thought such a county existed and the data presented were genuine facts. As my son passed through the living room, I even shouted out some sort of statistic or another and asked if he had ever read about such a thing in his history classes. He couldn’t recall, but it sounded ‘familiar’. Right, because much of this could have been true, yet it wasn’t. The institution of slavery of course was all too real and cruel, and that’s what this book is about, and this is the truth. Slavery in all its forms is evil. Henry Townsend is a black farmer. He is a former slave that with the purchase of freedom and some land becomes a slave owner himself. Henry and his wife Caldonia own a small plantation near the border of his former master’s much larger one. I could not wrap my head around why on earth a freed man would ever want to enslave another human being. Henry and other black slave owners like him justify their actions: \"Henry had always said that he wanted to be a better master than any white man he had ever known. He did not understand that the kind of world he wanted to create was doomed before he had even spoken the first syllable of the word master.\" Well, as the old saying goes, ‘the road to hell is paved with good intentions.’ When Henry dies, all hell breaks loose, and we begin to see the ill-fated consequences of an institution that is immoral and corrupt. A narrative that seems to jump around in time and between characters eventually comes together into a whole as consequences and events snowball out of control. Lives are permanently changed. Some for the worst, others (we hope) for the better. They all become woven together much like the massive tapestry hanging on the wall of another place in another time. Each is part of the story. Everyone is responsible for the events which passed, were allowed to pass despite the huge injustice to humanity. This book is not easy to read. The structure is challenging and the topic is gloomy, albeit important. What happens to the people we grow to care for is often horrifying and heartbreaking. But it is well-written and extremely impactful. An important novel which is well worth your time and attention if you are up for the challenge. It won't suit everyone, but if you are at all interested, I encourage you to pick this one up. \"What I feared most at that moment is what I still fear: that they would remember my history, that I, no matter what I had always said to the contrary, owned people of our Race.\""

        "text":"Dear The Known World : I'll be blunt. I'm breaking things off. This just isn't working. It's not you; it's me. Well, maybe it's you, too, a bit. I really thought when we got together that we would have a brief but mutually satisfying relationship. I'd read you, you'd provide enlightenment or emotional catharsis or entertainment, maybe even all three. All the signs were there: the laudatory quotes on your jacket, a shocking and unexpected premise, high marks on goodreads. But something was just off by the end of the first chapter. Maybe it was the masturbation scene right at the start. Or the characters that I just couldn't get into - I could hardly tell some of them apart. Or the way the narrative seemed to skip all over without any focus. Maybe I just didn't give you enough pages. I'm sure you got better as you went along. I mean, look at all the four- and five-star reviews you've gotten! But every time I picked you up my thoughts turned to the three other books on my bedside table that I'd rather be reading. I haven't actually been unfaithful, but that's just not a healthy basis for a relationship. So after 72 pages, I'm putting you down. Don't feel too bad. Focus on all those other, good reviews and maybe we'll meet again someday when the stars all align just right. But probably not.

        "text":"There’s irony that I read more than half of this wrenching, ugly, hopeful, stirring, and grievous book while holding a sleeping baby in my arms. Because there is a lot of life and death in this take on pre-Civil War Virginia. I knew little about the book except that the author wrote it after reading about freed Black folks owning slaves. In delving into this issue, which in any modern conversation circle must bring dissonance, disbelief, and maybe even disgust, I became increasingly moved and disturbed. A difficult book, both because it’s an unflinching look at slavery, but also because it’s written in a James Joyce-ish style — lots of asides and stream of consciousness text. The author careens from generation to generation and back again in often the same paragraph. Yet it worked for me. It reads like a memoir of an entire county’s 150-year history complete with dozens of families represented. What results is simply, UNFORGETTABLE. There are characters whose faces I imagined while reading and characters whose stories I became invested in that will haunt me. Not in the truth of a fictional characterization but more because the ugliness of humanity was so blatantly on display and sadly remains real to this day. As I bid farewell to the slaves, slaveowners, children of both and ministers, sheriffs and patrollers of this novel, I will not forget their names. And I can’t help but wonder who would I have been in Manchester County, Virginia? (Reviewed 2\/12\/25)"

        "text":"I'm going to have to rave a bit, because this is one of the best books I've read in the past ten years. Jones packs in all the historical detail you could want, and of course he's hit on a subject--black slaveowners--that in and of itself is tabloid-sensational. Where lesser writers might lean too hard on the sensational aspect (or rely on it to bolster an otherwise weak narrative), Jones works it into a compelling and powerful story. What makes it so powerful is a mix of fascinating characters who are woven into a series of overlapping plotlines. For me it's the structuring that is so brilliant (geek alert: I actually diagrammed the time shifts in the chapters as an exercise, to see when and how Jones yoked the whole thing together). This less than linear approach might be frustrating to those who just want things to be straightforward, but stick with it: the shifts provide suspense as well as texture, and they propel more than one storyline at once. They do all come together, trust me. I also admire the overarching authorial voice in the novel, which certainly leans toward the formal, but also comes across as aware of the history it's grappling with: here and there Jones projects his voice forward for a moment, or seemingly digresses with factual material and research. Again it's all part of the tapestry and the mix, and I also think that the level of narrative awareness (which never disengages long enough to derail anything) adds another layer to the very idea of history--making the whole historical and contemporary both. And for those of you who can do without all of the above writerly blather (a thousand pardons), you'll find in this book characters who are engaging, ignorant, cruel, earnest, sympathetic, tragic, hopeful, flawed--in short, complicated. Halfway through you'll be fighting off the impulse to skip ahead to learn everyone's fate. Finally, I'll say that this book isn't perfect--there are aspects of what I've described above that sometimes don't work: narrative turns that do seem pointless digressions, a character or two a bit stereotypical or annoying. No matter. This book aims high, as brilliant works of art do, and the result is nothing short of amazing."

        "text":"This book demands that you read it slowly and intently. Like eating a huge Thanksgiving dinner, you need to pause and digest before you have the next course. At the outset, the plot seems to be all over the place, bouncing from character to character, telling too many stories, not telling enough and then seeming to tell too much. Ah, but then, you make a little progress and the rhythm begins to assert itself, the stories begin to weave together, the minute details begin to become a diorama, the picture stops being a blur and comes into sharp focus. This isn’t one man’s story, or even the story of one place, this is the story of all men and this is the tale of a world. This book is not so much about race as it is about the abject insanity and evil of the institution of slavery, wherever it is found, whoever is practicing it. In this system, there are free black masters holding black slaves, some of them well-meaning, but it does not make the practice any less immoral. There are white men who love their black mistresses and the children they bear, but it does not remove the fact that they hold a dominion over them that is not borne of love in any of its guises. There are also individuals who are victims of the system and others who refuse to be victims of the system, even at the cost of their lives. I loved many of Jones’ characters, notably Augustus and Mildred Townsend. They exemplify what is the best in us. I felt sorry for some of them, like Sheriff John Skiffington, who would like to be better than this society allows him to be, and Caldonia Townsend’s brother, Calvin, who wishes to go to New York so that he will not have to bear witness to the cruelties around him, cruelties he must realized have escaped him only because of a trick of fortune. I despised some of them, and I recognized most of them. The petty and jealous, who must have dominion over someone to feel they have worth; the ungrateful and traitorous, who would turn upon a friend to put some silver in their own pockets; the meek and hopeless, who bow to the yoke and try simply to find a corner in which they are allowed to exist; the defiant and strong-minded, who fight with their last breath because to do otherwise is to prop up the indefensible; all are here. What I loved most about this novel is its genuineness, its lack of exaggeration or hyperbole, where surely none is needed, its emphasis on the day-to-day injustice of an institution that is accepted as insurmountable or even correct only because it is what is. Edward P. Jones has leveled an attack at the heart of mankind and defied one to imagine what they would have done, what they would have dared to do, in such a place and time."

        "text":"A very complex and beautiful, compelling book about Henry, a former slave who becomes a slave owner, & his wife Caldonia. But they're just the start - the book is really a series of stories & vignettes about the families, friends, neighbors & community surrounding Henry & Caldonia. It took me a really long time to get into the book, because there are so many characters, some important & some not, & the book jumps around in time, making it difficult to follow. Trust me, use the cast of characters at the end of this edition (why not place this at the beginning?!) & give up your expectations about traditional narrative format, & you'll LOVE this book as much as I did. In life, we have our own story kind of playing in our head, & at the same time we have all these other stories we're hearing - the story about your mother's great-uncle. The story about your brother in law's neighbor. The one about your sister's husband's aunt & her neighbor. the one about your coworker's mother. You know all those stories? That's what this book is like - some characters are more important than others, so you hear more of their stories, but minor characters have stories too, & they sort of appear out of nowhere, & you get to hear their story, & then they're gone. It's really very cool! I particularly loved the story of the womanizing slave who has a vision during a lightning storm\/tornado - & becomes the founder of an orphanage. And the little tiny story about the family who don't want to give up their cow, & the woman goes into the barn to milk the cow & there's this lovely description of her squirting the cow's milk into a cat's mouth, & if you've ever seen a cat eat with true contentment you will recognize the cat body language that Jones describes. Toward the end of the book there's a very powerful scene where a character, who isn't a particularly \"good\" character, says there should be a lantern or light of truth in the world, an actual place where people can stand & tell the truth without fear of retribution, where one might be able to right a wrong. It's a moment where you think, yes this guy could right the wrong by speaking out, because his fear of having people think he's \"on the negro's side\" is...well, wrong! But that's his fear & in that moment of the book you understand it & you think, yeah, what if he could speak out under that light of truth & not have anyone judge him? How wonderful would that be? While the book depicts the horrors of slavery, & there are a few characters who are outright despicable, there are many shades of gray in Jones' vision as well. It's a book that will make you think about slavery, the myths & realities & tragedies of it all, & on top of that it'll make you think about your own life & all the people you've known & how complex & interesting we all are, really. It's beautifully written & the characters will stick in your head as if you'd known them too. Oddly, I think what I initially disliked most about this book - its multitude of characters & convoluted timeline - is what I ended up really enjoying! Another example of a book that made my head expand, with some creakiness, but I'm glad the expansion can still happen!"

        "text":"In this book I learned that there used to be black slaveholders in the US. I thought that only white people were allowed to own slaves during the time that owning slaves were like owning properties. During that pre-Abolition time. During those sad dark days in the American history. Black Edward P. Jones (born 1951) wrote this historical epic novel, The Known World based on the not well known fact that there were some black slaveholders (black people owning black slaves) in the state of Virginia during the time in the US when owning slave is legal. Wikipedia has this to say: \"Slavery in the United States was a form of unfree labor which existed as a legal institution in North America for more than a century before the founding of the United States in 1776, and continued mostly in the South until the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution in 1865.[1] The first English colony in North America, Virginia, first imported Africans in 1619, a practice earlier established in the Spanish colonies as early as the 1560s.[2] Most slaves were black and were held by whites, although some Native Americans and free blacks also held slaves; there were a small number of white slaves as well.[3]\" Winner of the 2004 Pulitzer Award for Fiction, The Known World is one of the most memorable reads I had this year. It is not an easy book to read. This 388-page novel left me with a heavy chest each time I closed the book. Each page is gloomy and sad. The novel is well-told with lyrical prose creating a big canvas of imagery in one's mind while reading. In that big canvas are memorable and three-dimensional numerous characters most of them black slaves. No character is downright bad or good. The detailed description of the sceneries of a fictional county called Manchester and the true depictions of the characters are exceptionally striking that I had to slow down in my reading to savor the story and hold on *tugging to them, cheering them on* to each characters. Reading the last page left me with a heavy heart. I would not want to let go of that image of Manchester and say goodbye Please don't go yet to the characters that I already became part of my literary world. The world that resides in the recesses of my brain. The world that is known only to me populated by people who I met only in my readings. In terms of writing, Jones extensively use the technique called prolepsis that I first encountered reading Muriel Sparks' The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie (1961). Jones explained this in the interview (appendix of the book) saying that he is the God of those characters so he knows what happened in the life of each characters from the time he\/she was born up to the time his\/her death. The most moving example of this use was with the character of the child Tessie . One fine day of September 1855, their mistress Caldonia saw the 5-y\/o Tessie playing with a wooden toy horse. Caldonia says to the child: That is very nice, Tessie to which Tessie responded, My papa did this for me . In January 2002, on her deathbed, the old Tessie asked her caretaker to get the wooden toy horse from the attic. While holding the toy, she breathed her last saying the same thing: My papa did this for me . My heart stopped beating. Tears welled up in my eyes. That scene is just one of the many moving scenes about those slaves in that time of the history in Virginia when black people were traded like they were not human but properties. I can make this review very long. There are just too many good things I would like to say here but I am afraid that no review can make justice to a book as good as this."

Free blacks owned other black people. Some free blacks bought their family members and others just wanted the slave labor. Native Americans owned slaves for much of the same reasons. The Known World introduces us to some of those people. The Known World has won a whole gang of awards, so we know its an important book and the writing is top notch. My only problems with the book were the fact that there were too many characters. You know this is a pet peeve of mine and I lost track of all the characters in this book. My other problem was that it jumped backwards and forwards in time way too much. Most of the time jumps were super confusing. I liked The Known World but I think I might not be smart enough to read this book. I'll probably reread it sometime in the future and I do recommend to others because its a brilliant book."

While I was reading, I kept on going \"what did I just read? Am I really reading\/understanding this book?\" and kept on referring to the back cover of the book. No. The story was simply what I read. O.......K! Then ugh. I HATE leaving a book unread, so I kept on forcing myself to read thru the whole book. Finally the misery I was putting myself through ended, and UGH! The storyline. The author kept on jumping around the timeline too much - and honestly - I would describe this book as a glimpse of the lives of slaves in the south, but with a blah storyline. However this book has won a pultizer prize. EH!? Anyone out there who has read this book? Your opinions?? However like always, we learn from books. What I got out of this book was a new knowledge I never came upon, that black people owned black slaves.They even buy their own family members, and the slaves were considered as properties, including family. Hmm... History is richier than we will ever know or think of."

        "text":"The Known World does this weird thing: it cites its sources. And it's weird because they don't exist. There are passages like this: [Manchester, VA] went through a period of years and years of what University of Virginia historian Roberta Murphy in a 1948 book would call 'peace and prosperity'. Jones goes on to tell you the publication history of that book, and a few more things about what was in it, and to imply that Roberta Murphy was a little racist. But there is no Roberta Murphy, there is no book, there is no Manchester, VA. What is Jones up to? Wyatt Mason notes : What research on the subject Jones undertook was, in fact, quickly derailed after he happened upon an account of a white slave owner who spent her days abusing one of her black slaves, a little girl, by beating her head against a wall. “If I had wanted to tell the whole story of slavery, Americans couldn’t have taken that,” Jones told an interviewer. “People want to think that there was slavery, and then we got beyond it. People don’t want to hear that a woman would take a child and bang her head against the wall day after day. It’s nice that I didn’t read all those books. What I would have had to put down is far, far harsher and bleaker. Too much of a bummer? It's not that The Known World is a feel-good novel. Ears and Achilles tendons will be sliced. It follows the rules of slavery books: slave narratives always had happy endings; later, fictional slave narratives always have sad endings. But Toni Morrison has a different opinion about what Americans can and can't take. Shit, so does Harriet Jacobs. And Jones knows this, so he's being disingenuous. And you notice that he's talking about books he didn't actually read. NPR says, Jones collected two shelves of books about slavery, but never got around to reading them. Still, the author was able to use his imagination, and stories he had heard growing up, to make his characters come alive. \"I decided the people I'd created were real enough and I had just accumulated enough information about what the world was like in the South before 1865 to allow me to lie and get away with it,\" he says. Look, I don't mean to say Jones isn't telling the truth. I don't know if he is, and neither does he; neither of us read those two shelves of books about slavery. But the citation of imaginary sources in the book itself serves to either add authenticity that's undeserved, or - if you follow up on those sources - underline its lack of authenticity. I'm puzzled by it. This sort of meta-sourcing has been done before - by Nabokov in Pale Fire, by Cervantes, and in its closest parallel by Borges in his first collection, Universal History of Iniquity, which also confused me. It's especially jarring here, maybe just because I find the truth of slavery a fraught subject, and maybe because the layers go so deep - even in interviews about his lack of authenticity, he appears to be consciously inauthentic. I don't know, man, I don't get it. But anyway: is it a good made-up story about made-up people? Yeah, sure, totally. Eventually. The first half is a little annoying. There's a lot of chronological foofarah - skipping all over the place for no pressing reason - and a ginormous cast it's hard to keep track of, and our super-omniscient narrator often takes time out to tell you some trivial character's entire life story, which you didn't really need. But the second half ratchets up the tension to pure shit-your-pantsville, as that sprawling cast all meet their assorted fates. It makes up for some irritation in the first half. So yeah, as a novel it's excellent. The authenticity issue, I bring up mostly because we take this book seriously; it won a Pulitzer. It deserves to be looked carefully at. I looked carefully and I was confused by its truth."

        "text":"Despite some luminous moments where the characters come alive in a special way, this novel about the lives of slaves in a fictional community in Virginia of the 1830s felt too hermetic and sealed off for me to enjoy it as thoroughly as others might. The special hook that the story holds is its rendering of freed blacks who became slave owners themselves. The focus is on one such plantation with about 30 slaves which is struggling to adapt to the death of its black master, Henry Townsend. We get a plausible history along the way of how his father, Augustus, was so talented at furniture making that he bought his own freedom, and state legislative action allowed him to continue residing in the state and eventually bought the freedom of his son. With other free blacks, such as the feisty, condescending teacher Fern, who came from the North, they form a small society of their own. While Augustus abhors slavery, his son tries to emulate the path taken by the whites to economic success by owning slaves. Despite an ambition to become a benevolent master, the corrupting influence of owning people as property is well portrayed. When his lonely widow takes up a love relationship with her plantation foreman, she is replicating the same abuse of power enacted by most other white plantation owners, and the consequences are tragic. The “known world” of plantation life in this fictional county is like an island in time, and the characters themselves seem stuck in it like insects in amber. The omniscient narrator is god-like in passing into the thoughts and dreams of more than a dozen characters. Unfortunately, the reader gets distanced from emotionally connecting to them by the narrator breaking the flow to leap backward and forward in time to reveal some particular fact or person’s fate (for more see: D.D. Wood review ). Ultimately, the human bonds holding people to each other came off as tenuous and unreal as beholding a ship in a bottle. Unlike the romanticized lives portrayed in Hailey’s “Roots”, the characters have no sense of cultural history of their African origins (the word itself appears nowhere in the book), and there is no foreshadowing of plantation life as a doomed phase in history on the path to the Civil War. The idea of a slave revolt is unthinkable, and the one humane white character, Sheriff Skiffington, feels no compunction over diligently carrying out a big part of his job in organizing night patrols and retrieval efforts when “property” runs away. Though we get no sense of the reality of the “Underground Railroad”, we do get a brilliant vision at one point where Augustus ends up mailing a slave girl to Philadelphia in a crate along with a shipment of his hand-carved walking sticks. In an interview with Jones appended to the audiobook version of the novel, he admits he did not do much research for the book and was not concerned about communicating any particular message to his readers about the history of slavery. As the creator of all the characters, he would not admit to favoring any one character over another. Still the reader can’t help but getting the message of how inhumane slavery was and how individuals trapped in it strived to achieve some form of dignity in their lives. Like other reviewers, I didn’t feel I got to know any of the characters well enough to get emotionally engaged with them. When not interrupted by invasions from the narrator, the prose is effective in evoking the place and time, an obvious factor in helping it gain a Pulitzer Prize. Here is a lovely example from the opening for the book: The evening his master dies he worked again well after he ended the day for the other adults, his own wife among them, and sent them back with hunger and tiredness to their cabins. The young ones, his son among them, had been sent out of the fields an hour or so before the adults, to prepare the late supper and, if there was time enough, to play in a few minutes of sun that were left. When he, Moses, finally freed himself of the ancient and brittle harness that connected him to the oldest mule his master owned, all that was left of the sun was a five-inch long memory of red orange laid out in still waves across the horizon between two mountains on the left and one on the right. He had been in the fields for all of fourteen hours. He paused before leaving the fields as the evening quiet wrapped itself about him. The mule quivered, wanting home and rest. Moses closed his eyes and bent down and took a pinch of the soil and ate it with no more thought than if it were a spot of cornbread. …he ate it not only to discover the strengths and weaknesses of the field, but because eating it tied him to the only thing in his small world that meant almost as much as his own life."

        "text":"Glorious account that gets past cliches. The premise is that two slaves in 1840s Virginia bought their freedom, but their son stayed a little too long under the master's care. What does the family do when the son starts his own farm and buys his own slaves? The mastery of Jones' writing comes in the sense of history that he lends to minute objects, chance encounters, and incantatory reveries within a frought landscape. Not content to write an unwritten history of forgotten people, Jones re-writes the histories that have been written, citing documents the purport to explain the historical phenomenon of free blacks who owned slaves. Passages that carry runaway characters to the north also tie in academic treatises from the next century, deeds and warrants and court decisions that attempted to justify white supremacy, and the momentoes that emancipated children carry to their deathbeds. Jones doesn't neglect to include tales of individual transformation, collective redemption, or international implications in this epic. Characters may come and go like fleeting ghosts, yet the marks they leave may remain. When the words of the plantation master and deeds of the escaped overseer have faded into ineffectual memory, we readers are left with both the sense that an institution has gone horribly wrong and that the people within it can be honorably right; even if the results remain unapparent, the promise of future change remains, along with the threat of complacency and neglect. Jones didn't attempt to detail the national debate over slavery that was current at that time. That limitation on his project was probably a good one. It allows us to see the human effects that rhetoric had covered, and allowed him to devote his attentions to demonstrating the range of positions that people could occupy in relation to the institution. Yes, whether you're descended from a slave, a master, a freed man, a black woman passing as white, an unwilling overseer, a treacherous deputy, a conscientious drunk, or an immigrant Irishwoman sold into prostitution, there's something in this book for you - and I wish that I was only joking, but the irony is that there is no irony here, and sincerity is the least of what we have to do, and memory is only the start of making a history that hasn't stopped."

        "text":"Set in antebellum Virginia, a former slave, Henry Townsend, owns fifty acres of land and thirty-three slaves. As the story opens, Townsend is dying. The novel chronicles his life, the lives of his family members, and the lives of people he encountered in the community. The main characters are three-dimensional and feel like real people, with both admirable traits and flaws. Jones employs an omniscient narrator and non-linear storytelling. He weaves together overlapping stories of past and present events, such that the reader knows what happens to these people in the future before knowing what has happened to them in the book’s “present.” There are a great many characters in this book and the list of Dramatis Personae is helpful in keeping them all straight. This novel is based on a lesser known historical fact. While it was not common, it did happen that some free blacks owned slaves. It lends a complexity to the slavery narrative – showing how people can be impacted by society’s strictures and how victims of exploitation could become perpetrators of the same system. This is not a quick and easy read. It feels like being immersed in the life and times of Manchester County, Virginia, in the 1850s. It is an eloquently written condemnation of oppression in any form. This book won the Pulitzer Prize in 2004."

        "text":"2.5-stars, really. here is a perfect example of a books i should love, and yet.... i didn't. the book was a lot of work and, for me, very little reward. i think most of my issues are because of the style\/structure of the novel: * the third-person, omniscient narrator - this was distracting from very early on in the read. i held off judging it. i wanted to trust jones and his choice. * non-linear narrative - i don't tend to have problems with this at all, but i found it super-clunky here. also distracting. * the made-up references - jones would cite sources and details that seemed to lend such an air of gravitas, but none of it is actually real. (i know, i know. this is fiction. a novel. get over it. but it was just kinda weird to me. social commentary inserted into fiction happens. steinbeck did it. teju cole does it. many writers do this. i felt like jones did a crap-ton of research for this book. but then i read this NPR piece . in it, he notes he collected 2 shelves worth of books on slavery... \"but never got around to reading them\" . so this just added to my 'what the?' on the references in the novel and jones' research.) * all of this combined for a really awkward flow, and convoluted storytelling. i felt like it could lose 50-100 pages and be a tighter, better story. in case you think maybe i am a lazy reader - i'm not, i swear! i love nothing more than a meaty, tough read. jones' story is definitely both of these things. he explores the issue of free black people owning slaves in virginia, and he gives us a large cast of active characters. but it all felt so... surface-y. we get the actions and reactions, but we don't really get the motivations or emotions. jones is navigating a morally dodgy landscape, one i would have loved to have gone into more deeply. we are given the horrors and the heartbreaks, but it all felt so detached. and, you know, maybe that is totally on purpose. maybe, for some people, detachment is the only way through such a horrible time in history. jones has collected some serious critical acclaim and recognition over his career. to name a few: he's won the pulitzer, the national book critic's circle award, the PEN\/Hemingway award, a MacArthur genius grant, and the International IMPAC dublin literary award. he's won nearly $1 million in literary awards alone. the man knows what he's doing, and the respect he's earned is fairly universal. the known world is an important story. but is just shining the light on the issues jones raises enough? so now i am back to the should . i should love this book. (it was just okay for me.) people should read this book. (indeed. but this is not a book i will blanket recommend to all.) so, i don't know you guys. i am bummed over this one. and this is a terrible review\/collection of thoughts. maybe i'll become more coherent with some distance and fix this up a bit - but for now i wanted to note down something here. (aside #1 (going to be a bit spoiler-y here): moses confused me. or, rather, his turn to all-of-a-sudden being an asshole was weird. we're going along with moses. he seems like a lovely man. then, halfway into the book, he's a wife-beater, jerkface? where did that come from, and why was he presented like that? the reveal of moses being a not nice man was sudden and odd.) (aside #2: worth noting (was hugely interesting to me) - the cover photo of this edition is © Eudora Welty ! i had no idea about her photographic prowess .)"

        "text":"Here is a book about black slave owners in the antebellum South! My interest was immediately piqued. On top of that, the book has won all sorts of prizes: *Pulitzer Prize for Fiction (2004) *International Dublin Literary Award (2005) *Anisfield-Wolf Book Award (2004) *National Book Critics Circle Award for Fiction (2003) * Hurston\/Wright Legacy Award Nominee for Debut Fiction (\/2004 *National Book Award Finalist for Fiction (2003) I knew I had to give it a try. I am glad I have read it, but to say I like it, would just not be true. It’s OK, so I am giving it two stars. There is no real central character to the story, because he dies right off the bat. It is 1855 when Henry Townsend dies. He is black. He had been a slave, but his parents had bought him his freedom. He leaves behind no children but a wife, Caldonia, a twenty-eight-year-old educated black woman born free, and his property of thirty-three slaves and fifty acres in Manchester County, Virginia. The book is about the hell that breaks loose afterwards, but really what it is about is life in the South during the antebellum era, about the mindset of Blacks and Whites of this era. The story is told by an omniscient narrator—who knows how each character thinks, what has happened to all of them in the past and what will happen to all of them in the future. It is this all-seeing narrator that shapes the entire feel of the story. This narrator knows everything, but he is not particularly adept at cogently telling a story. In one sentence you may switch form the present to the future and back again. In the next sentence you flip back to the past. It is easy to become confused. Character upon character is thrown at you, with little tidbits about their lives in the past, present and future. You are given an entire community of individuals—Whites and Blacks, a Native American or two, those who are free and those who are slaves, a sheriff and his deputy. The omniscient narrator is constantly restating who each one is, which is good in one sense, but the flow of the tale becomes jerky. Stop and start, backward and forward and often confusing. Use of the omniscient narrator is pushed to the extreme. It is kind of nice to have a character or two to guide you through a story. You do not have that here. There are a whole group of characters, characters that are hard to attach yourself to. You do not get close to any one individual. In the afterword the author points out that he wanted to draw characters that were neither all good nor all bad, each one different in their own way. You do get that here, but you fail to feel anything for any of them. What you do get is a strong sense of being one of a large community. You are there, one among many, living in the antebellum South. This does give one a hands-on feeling of life then and there and how people were thinking. Kevin Free narrates the audiobook. It is simple to follow, the speed is fine and he intonations are well done. The narration performance is good so I have given the narration three stars."

        "text":"I attended a workshop with some friends during which we all went around the room and recommended books that really moved us that year. I don't remember which book I suggested then, but I recall one woman in particular who really loved this book (or I believe she was more in love with Edward Jones' writing). At the end of the workshop we had a gift exchange raffle and she included this book as her contribution. I was the lucky recipient of this free copy. I was interested in this historical novel set in a fictional place in Virginia during the antebellum era, about a former slave who ends up owning slaves. The strangeness of the story and the angle it takes as a slave narrative is intriguing. Also appealing is the way the omniscient narration allows the reader to approach the story without the moral judgement one reserves for this kind of story, since the distance of the narration allows one to realize quickly what the story tries to showcase: how slavery has already poisoned the integrity of all involved. The framework of the novel is composed of anecdotal stories within stories, with pacing often interrupted for a mini scene or two, or an introduction of yet another character who may reappear later or simply disappear. Put another way, it is a book of puzzle pieces: one is added, taken away, another picked up, oh yes, there's the whole, whoops, maybe not, here goes another piece. So although I admired the writing and story setup in the beginning, I just was not in the right space to complete this novel. It has been a while since I added a book to my \"did-not-finish\" list; alas, this one has just made the list. This is not a failed attempt at reading this novel, however, because I remember not being able to finish Ngugi wa Thiong'o's Wizard of the Crow only to later fall in love with his novel, Petals of Blood . With that in mind, I look forward to reading Jones' Lost in the City ."

While not exactly removing race from the issue of slavery, Jones is able to show that even among African-Americans the perniciousness of slavery could damn a generation. The best summary of this idea came from a NYTimes review: 'There are few certified villains in this novel, white or black, because slavery poisons moral judgments at the root. As Jones shows, slavery corrupts good intentions and underwrites bad ones, yet allows decency the odd occasion -- but only by creating such an enormous need for it.' The pacing and structure of this novel could be a little challenging to some, but I found that it fit the narrative perfectly. This isn't a novel that burns you with its quotable sentences, but it scars you with its images. There were periods in it where I thought I was reading a Cormac McCarthy novel. That alone is high praise."

        "text":"When Toni Morrison began her research for \"Beloved,\" she discovered a trove of ghastly instruments. She knew, of course, that slaves were routinely whipped, starved, raped, and hanged, but the existence of specially forged tools was a surprise: metal bits forced down the throat, iron masks locked across the face, spiked collars clasped around the neck. Her Pulitzer Prize-winning novel reintroduced those horrors into the national memory and did much to demonstrate that the cruelties of slavery extended far beyond hard labor and physical deprivation. \"The Known World,\" by Edward Jones, reclaims another peculiarity of American slavery and in the process illustrates yet again that we can't under- estimate its perverse contortions of the human spirit. Bizarre as it sounds, in Louisiana, Virginia, and South Carolina, a small number of free blacks owned their own plantations - and their own slaves. It was a precarious arrangement, to be sure. Blacks who were freed or managed to buy their own freedom had little incentive to tarry in the South. The laws governing their status and their right to hold property were ambiguous and easy for any white person to shred. Jones uses this fragile situation as the setting for a novel about a group of black and white Virginians who tried - sometimes nobly, often viciously - to maintain their world in the face of inevitable collapse. To the extent that Morrison spun a surreal tale of American slavery into mythic proportions, Jones has carved a companion series of stark anecdotes into national legends. In a measured voice that never rises to reflect the agonies and absurdities he describes, he moves back and forth through decades and across state lines, assembling an apparently random collection of brief scenes that gradually fuse into a stunning portrait of moral confusion. The story revolves around Henry Townsend, a black man who, with the indulgence of his former owner, managed to buy his own farm and his own slaves - eventually 29 adults and a collection of children. Henry's parents, who labored tirelessly to free him as a child, are horrified by his participation in the flesh market, but Henry is ambitious, and, what's more, he learned from his master that \"once you own even one, you will never be alone.\" As a protection against loneliness and a way to wealth, Henry can't imagine anything more successful, and he's convinced he can be \"a better master than any white man he had ever known.\" Indeed, he attains that dubious goal, creating a plantation with forced labor that's largely free of physical beatings, but it's an insidious gentility that only camouflages the humiliations of Southern slavery. Nevertheless, his untimely death frightens most of his slaves, who know just how delicate their relative comfort is. Only the brooding overseer, Moses, the first slave Henry ever bought, sees his master's demise as an opportunity - not for freedom, but for taking his place. Indeed, what interests Jones most in this complex novel is the way slavery distorts judgment, not just of those who oppress, but of those who are oppressed. Henry's widow, Caldonia, quickly decides against freeing \"her legacy,\" choosing instead to maintain the plantation in the spirit of Henry's gentle example. \"Her husband had done the best he could,\" she thinks, \"and on Judgment Day his slaves would stand before God and testify to that fact.\" Occasionally, a child is worked to death or a pregnant woman labors in the field till she miscarries, but Caldonia sheds sincere tears, comforts the parents, and considers whether she should buy insurance against further losses of her property. As a single woman with a large business to run, she's encouraged by a collection of family and friends, other free blacks, some of whom own their own slaves, too. One of the most troubling is Fern, Caldonia's prim teacher of literature and etiquette. Together, they keep the irony of their position well buried, while socializing in a kind of racial terrarium maintained by William Robbins, the county's wealthiest white farmer. Estranged from his own wife but protected by his political power, he loves a black woman in town and openly adores his two mulatto children. The Townsend plantation with its little coterie of free slave-owning blacks gives his favorites a place to play and refine themselves. In one of several shifts to the late 19th century, a Canadian historian interviews Fern, Caldonia's teacher, about those days on the plantation. \"All of us do only what the law and God tell us we can do,\" she says without any hint of guilt or remorse. \"We owned slaves. It was what was done, and so that is what we did.\" Jones uses that same tone of historical distance throughout, a tone that amplifies the grotesque mingling of affection and cruelty that infected these people, black and white. In the center of this moral kaleidoscope stands the sheriff, John Skiffington, an earnest Christian, dedicated to the objective application of law and convinced that \"the law always cares\" for everyone equally. It's a doomed endeavor, of course, but as Caldonia's plantation begins to collapse, Skiffington fails to realize that the legal system he's sworn to uphold is not objective and that he cannot remain clean within it. The scrambled collection of events and characters makes this a difficult story to enter, but that structure eventually accounts for much of the novel's evocative power. Jones has a kind of biblical style that suggests whole lives in a few stark details from a perspective that's alternately microscopic and telescopic. It's a technique that resists our efforts to keep these events in some unrecoverable past. The troubling implications of his story leach in through hairline cracks all over the twin shells of antebellum nostalgia and Northern piety. Every time Caldonia cheerfully reminds her friends, \"We are all worthy of one another,\" the legacy of slavery sounds more complex and unresolved. http:\/\/www.csmonitor.com\/2003\/0814\/p1..."

        "text":"Manchester County, Virginia doesn't exist. Never has. After reading The Known World, however, you'd be forgiven if you thought you could take a tour of it's plantations and slave cemetaries on your vacation to colonial Williamsburg. The complicated pre-civil war Southern society that Edward P. Jones creates feels as real and surreal as any factual history of slavery you've read. It was not so much the story of Henry Townsend, a black slave owner, and all the people that his death allows us to meet that engaged me. It was the world, a world where I could taste the soil I might till and the women I might marry and the terrible choices I might be faced with, that put it's claws in me and refused to let go. It took me nearly 2 months to finish the book's 388 pages. It should've been a quick read. It is a fascinating place with peculiar problems and characters I cried for on more than one occasion. It should've been a quick read but I kept asking myself this question: who would I have been? The slave, toiling away in the field? The overseer, unable to see the world for what it truly was? The freed man, working desperately to free the rest of his family? The smart child, taken under the wing of the rich white slave owner and convinced that there was nothing wrong with owning another human being? The broken black man tortured by his family's wealth built on the backs of men and women that look just like me? The slave too proud, too strong, too powerful to let another take his freedom? Who would I have been? Who am I now? In matters of race, there is always that fool's point, usually made by a white person (though not always) that asks,\"why aren't you over it, already? Can't we just let it go?\" It is a way to end an uncomfortable conversation. The reasons don't matter. I know many a person for which the sticky tar baby of race in America is simply a discussion they can't stick their hands in. It is too difficult. Too raw. Too cloudy to be sure that people will remain friends after an honest chat. The way I feel when I read books like The Known World is my answer. No matter how well-adjusted, how integrated, how loving of my fellow man, how multiculti kumbayah I am, I'm not over it. I can't let it go. This fictional world was very real not all that long ago. It's effects still ripple through our every day. The world I know doesn't exist without it. Highly highly recommended."

        "text":"I know this is a critically acclaimed book, a Pulitzer winner, and a book tackling a difficult and complex stain on America history: slavery and black slave owners. There are moments when the book does say some interesting things or reveal some unsavory and uncomfortable truths, but it was so hard to engage with as a reader. I mean, I hung in with DFW through the first 600 pages of Infinite Jest where nothing happens -- but because I was fascinated by Hal, Orin, Marathe, Steeply, and Mario and Madame Psychosis who all fascinated me. There were literally dozens of other characters but these all pulled me in. In The Known World, there are also dozens of characters but none that I grew any attachment too. It was as if the author Jones was using a hand-held camera and no stabilizer so that the images were jumpy and out of focus. It reminded me sometimes of how the world seems to my myopic eyes between taking off my glasses in the morning and putting in my contact lenses. The narration also highly annoyed me. All the parenthetical \"in 60 years so and so will do such as such\" were meaningless because I was given neither enough time nor enough detail to give a shit. Further, there is this reference to \"years later they would all turn into human torches in front of the dry foods store\", but no mention afterwards of to what this referred. But the most annoying bit was in using the Canadian journalist frame at about page 130 or so (which then only briefly appears in the narrative 200 pages later in a parenthetical throwaway comment, it is said that the journalist would never marry his heart's desire yet 3 pages later, they marry and that coming to talk to Fern that there was some incomprehensible stuff that happens off-screen that morning (also never adequately explained) and so she was not going to open up to the journalist and yet we still find her filling in details about Henry, Moses and Caledonia 30 pages later. Too much inconsistency - was the editor asleep or stoned and missed these? So, despite taking on a complex subject, Jones is no Faulkner as his South does not eve approach that of the Great William. He is not as good as Pynchon or DFW is manipulating time and space in a narrative that was 100 or 150 pages too long and felt it, and he is not Alice Walker or Toni Morrison who brought us the most amazing, poignant, and powerful images of slavery and its residual impacts generations later that I have ever read. So, read Beloved or Absalom, Absalom if you want to hear about the South and I expect you will be less frustrated, but every bit enraged at this deplorable institution that is a cancer on the American past."

        "text":"Ambitious, Interesting, Disorganized In an interview, Edward P. Jones revealed that The Known World took shape around 1) when he heard that Black people had owned slaves and 2) when he read a thin paperback in high school about a Jewish man who decided to join the Nazi party, how he acted in opposition to how one would expect. The Known World is an ambitious novel which aims to describe the world of 1855 where Henry Townsend has recently died. As a result of his death, a cloud of uncertainty hangs in the air as he leaves behind his widow, Caldonia, and the undetermined fate of the slaves he purchased to work his land. Although the plot is interesting, this book is disorganized. It covers many different characters and rapidly shifts time periods. I would be reading along and then the text would say “and this person lived to be 93 years old and had 235 grandchildren.” (paraphrasing) Countless times, I had to stop and reread because the storytelling was so clunky. In The Known World, there are quite a few references to Adam and Eve, even references to Milton (Paradise Lost). My favorite author, Philip Pullman, loves to talk about this topic and how in his works he wanted his characters to find their way back to The Garden by taking the long way around. So this quote on page 329 stood out: “There was a long way around but he chose not to take it.” There is a character in The Known World by the name of Anderson Frazier. He creates and distributes pamphlets and interviews Fern Elston. In my opinion, this pamphlet could have provided a framework to systematically organize the characters instead of the resulting jumbled and confusing soup of characters and timelines. The Known World has some unforgettable moments, but the organization of the narrative reduces the enjoyment of the reading experience.

        "text":"This is a complex novel, with dense writing, a non-linear structure, and an abundance of characters. It reads much like a true historical account of a place, Manchester County, Virginia, and time, pre-Civil War 1800s. This could very nearly have passed for a non-fiction book; each character feels so real, their personal stories and histories so authentic. The author even goes so far as to tell us what happens to many of them ten, twenty or even fifty years in the future. And yet, Edward P. Jones himself states: \"The county and town of Manchester, Virginia, and every human being in those places, are products of my imagination… The census records I made up for Manchester were, again, simply to make the reader feel that the town and the county and the people lived and breathed in central Virginia once upon a time…\" Well, consider me duped. At first I really thought such a county existed and the data presented were genuine facts. As my son passed through the living room, I even shouted out some sort of statistic or another and asked if he had ever read about such a thing in his history classes. He couldn’t recall, but it sounded ‘familiar’. Right, because much of this could have been true, yet it wasn’t. The institution of slavery of course was all too real and cruel, and that’s what this book is about, and this is the truth. Slavery in all its forms is evil. Henry Townsend is a black farmer. He is a former slave that with the purchase of freedom and some land becomes a slave owner himself. Henry and his wife Caldonia own a small plantation near the border of his former master’s much larger one. I could not wrap my head around why on earth a freed man would ever want to enslave another human being. Henry and other black slave owners like him justify their actions: \"Henry had always said that he wanted to be a better master than any white man he had ever known. He did not understand that the kind of world he wanted to create was doomed before he had even spoken the first syllable of the word master.\" Well, as the old saying goes, ‘the road to hell is paved with good intentions.’ When Henry dies, all hell breaks loose, and we begin to see the ill-fated consequences of an institution that is immoral and corrupt. A narrative that seems to jump around in time and between characters eventually comes together into a whole as consequences and events snowball out of control. Lives are permanently changed. Some for the worst, others (we hope) for the better. They all become woven together much like the massive tapestry hanging on the wall of another place in another time. Each is part of the story. Everyone is responsible for the events which passed, were allowed to pass despite the huge injustice to humanity. This book is not easy to read. The structure is challenging and the topic is gloomy, albeit important. What happens to the people we grow to care for is often horrifying and heartbreaking. But it is well-written and extremely impactful. An important novel which is well worth your time and attention if you are up for the challenge. It won't suit everyone, but if you are at all interested, I encourage you to pick this one up. \"What I feared most at that moment is what I still fear: that they would remember my history, that I, no matter what I had always said to the contrary, owned people of our Race.\""

I really thought when we got together that we would have a brief but mutually satisfying relationship. I'd read you, you'd provide enlightenment or emotional catharsis or entertainment, maybe even all three. All the signs were there: the laudatory quotes on your jacket, a shocking and unexpected premise, high marks on goodreads. But something was just off by the end of the first chapter. Maybe it was the masturbation scene right at the start. Or the characters that I just couldn't get into - I could hardly tell some of them apart. Or the way the narrative seemed to skip all over without any focus. Maybe I just didn't give you enough pages. I'm sure you got better as you went along. I mean, look at all the four- and five-star reviews you've gotten! But every time I picked you up my thoughts turned to the three other books on my bedside table that I'd rather be reading. I haven't actually been unfaithful, but that's just not a healthy basis for a relationship. So after 72 pages, I'm putting you down. Don't feel too bad. Focus on all those other, good reviews and maybe we'll meet again someday when the stars all align just right. But probably not.

        "text":"There’s irony that I read more than half of this wrenching, ugly, hopeful, stirring, and grievous book while holding a sleeping baby in my arms. Because there is a lot of life and death in this take on pre-Civil War Virginia. I knew little about the book except that the author wrote it after reading about freed Black folks owning slaves. In delving into this issue, which in any modern conversation circle must bring dissonance, disbelief, and maybe even disgust, I became increasingly moved and disturbed. A difficult book, both because it’s an unflinching look at slavery, but also because it’s written in a James Joyce-ish style — lots of asides and stream of consciousness text. The author careens from generation to generation and back again in often the same paragraph. Yet it worked for me. It reads like a memoir of an entire county’s 150-year history complete with dozens of families represented. What results is simply, UNFORGETTABLE. There are characters whose faces I imagined while reading and characters whose stories I became invested in that will haunt me. Not in the truth of a fictional characterization but more because the ugliness of humanity was so blatantly on display and sadly remains real to this day. As I bid farewell to the slaves, slaveowners, children of both and ministers, sheriffs and patrollers of this novel, I will not forget their names. And I can’t help but wonder who would I have been in Manchester County, Virginia? (Reviewed 2\/12\/25)"

        "text":"I'm going to have to rave a bit, because this is one of the best books I've read in the past ten years. Jones packs in all the historical detail you could want, and of course he's hit on a subject--black slaveowners--that in and of itself is tabloid-sensational. Where lesser writers might lean too hard on the sensational aspect (or rely on it to bolster an otherwise weak narrative), Jones works it into a compelling and powerful story. What makes it so powerful is a mix of fascinating characters who are woven into a series of overlapping plotlines. For me it's the structuring that is so brilliant (geek alert: I actually diagrammed the time shifts in the chapters as an exercise, to see when and how Jones yoked the whole thing together). This less than linear approach might be frustrating to those who just want things to be straightforward, but stick with it: the shifts provide suspense as well as texture, and they propel more than one storyline at once. They do all come together, trust me. I also admire the overarching authorial voice in the novel, which certainly leans toward the formal, but also comes across as aware of the history it's grappling with: here and there Jones projects his voice forward for a moment, or seemingly digresses with factual material and research. Again it's all part of the tapestry and the mix, and I also think that the level of narrative awareness (which never disengages long enough to derail anything) adds another layer to the very idea of history--making the whole historical and contemporary both. And for those of you who can do without all of the above writerly blather (a thousand pardons), you'll find in this book characters who are engaging, ignorant, cruel, earnest, sympathetic, tragic, hopeful, flawed--in short, complicated. Halfway through you'll be fighting off the impulse to skip ahead to learn everyone's fate. Finally, I'll say that this book isn't perfect--there are aspects of what I've described above that sometimes don't work: narrative turns that do seem pointless digressions, a character or two a bit stereotypical or annoying. No matter. This book aims high, as brilliant works of art do, and the result is nothing short of amazing."

        "text":"This book demands that you read it slowly and intently. Like eating a huge Thanksgiving dinner, you need to pause and digest before you have the next course. At the outset, the plot seems to be all over the place, bouncing from character to character, telling too many stories, not telling enough and then seeming to tell too much. Ah, but then, you make a little progress and the rhythm begins to assert itself, the stories begin to weave together, the minute details begin to become a diorama, the picture stops being a blur and comes into sharp focus. This isn’t one man’s story, or even the story of one place, this is the story of all men and this is the tale of a world. This book is not so much about race as it is about the abject insanity and evil of the institution of slavery, wherever it is found, whoever is practicing it. In this system, there are free black masters holding black slaves, some of them well-meaning, but it does not make the practice any less immoral. There are white men who love their black mistresses and the children they bear, but it does not remove the fact that they hold a dominion over them that is not borne of love in any of its guises. There are also individuals who are victims of the system and others who refuse to be victims of the system, even at the cost of their lives. I loved many of Jones’ characters, notably Augustus and Mildred Townsend. They exemplify what is the best in us. I felt sorry for some of them, like Sheriff John Skiffington, who would like to be better than this society allows him to be, and Caldonia Townsend’s brother, Calvin, who wishes to go to New York so that he will not have to bear witness to the cruelties around him, cruelties he must realized have escaped him only because of a trick of fortune. I despised some of them, and I recognized most of them. The petty and jealous, who must have dominion over someone to feel they have worth; the ungrateful and traitorous, who would turn upon a friend to put some silver in their own pockets; the meek and hopeless, who bow to the yoke and try simply to find a corner in which they are allowed to exist; the defiant and strong-minded, who fight with their last breath because to do otherwise is to prop up the indefensible; all are here. What I loved most about this novel is its genuineness, its lack of exaggeration or hyperbole, where surely none is needed, its emphasis on the day-to-day injustice of an institution that is accepted as insurmountable or even correct only because it is what is. Edward P. Jones has leveled an attack at the heart of mankind and defied one to imagine what they would have done, what they would have dared to do, in such a place and time."

        "text":"A very complex and beautiful, compelling book about Henry, a former slave who becomes a slave owner, & his wife Caldonia. But they're just the start - the book is really a series of stories & vignettes about the families, friends, neighbors & community surrounding Henry & Caldonia. It took me a really long time to get into the book, because there are so many characters, some important & some not, & the book jumps around in time, making it difficult to follow. Trust me, use the cast of characters at the end of this edition (why not place this at the beginning?!) & give up your expectations about traditional narrative format, & you'll LOVE this book as much as I did. In life, we have our own story kind of playing in our head, & at the same time we have all these other stories we're hearing - the story about your mother's great-uncle. The story about your brother in law's neighbor. The one about your sister's husband's aunt & her neighbor. the one about your coworker's mother. You know all those stories? That's what this book is like - some characters are more important than others, so you hear more of their stories, but minor characters have stories too, & they sort of appear out of nowhere, & you get to hear their story, & then they're gone. It's really very cool! I particularly loved the story of the womanizing slave who has a vision during a lightning storm\/tornado - & becomes the founder of an orphanage. And the little tiny story about the family who don't want to give up their cow, & the woman goes into the barn to milk the cow & there's this lovely description of her squirting the cow's milk into a cat's mouth, & if you've ever seen a cat eat with true contentment you will recognize the cat body language that Jones describes. Toward the end of the book there's a very powerful scene where a character, who isn't a particularly \"good\" character, says there should be a lantern or light of truth in the world, an actual place where people can stand & tell the truth without fear of retribution, where one might be able to right a wrong. It's a moment where you think, yes this guy could right the wrong by speaking out, because his fear of having people think he's \"on the negro's side\" is...well, wrong! But that's his fear & in that moment of the book you understand it & you think, yeah, what if he could speak out under that light of truth & not have anyone judge him? How wonderful would that be? While the book depicts the horrors of slavery, & there are a few characters who are outright despicable, there are many shades of gray in Jones' vision as well. It's a book that will make you think about slavery, the myths & realities & tragedies of it all, & on top of that it'll make you think about your own life & all the people you've known & how complex & interesting we all are, really. It's beautifully written & the characters will stick in your head as if you'd known them too. Oddly, I think what I initially disliked most about this book - its multitude of characters & convoluted timeline - is what I ended up really enjoying! Another example of a book that made my head expand, with some creakiness, but I'm glad the expansion can still happen!"

        "text":"In this book I learned that there used to be black slaveholders in the US. I thought that only white people were allowed to own slaves during the time that owning slaves were like owning properties. During that pre-Abolition time. During those sad dark days in the American history. Black Edward P. Jones (born 1951) wrote this historical epic novel, The Known World based on the not well known fact that there were some black slaveholders (black people owning black slaves) in the state of Virginia during the time in the US when owning slave is legal. Wikipedia has this to say: \"Slavery in the United States was a form of unfree labor which existed as a legal institution in North America for more than a century before the founding of the United States in 1776, and continued mostly in the South until the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution in 1865.[1] The first English colony in North America, Virginia, first imported Africans in 1619, a practice earlier established in the Spanish colonies as early as the 1560s.[2] Most slaves were black and were held by whites, although some Native Americans and free blacks also held slaves; there were a small number of white slaves as well.[3]\" Winner of the 2004 Pulitzer Award for Fiction, The Known World is one of the most memorable reads I had this year. It is not an easy book to read. This 388-page novel left me with a heavy chest each time I closed the book. Each page is gloomy and sad. The novel is well-told with lyrical prose creating a big canvas of imagery in one's mind while reading. In that big canvas are memorable and three-dimensional numerous characters most of them black slaves. No character is downright bad or good. The detailed description of the sceneries of a fictional county called Manchester and the true depictions of the characters are exceptionally striking that I had to slow down in my reading to savor the story and hold on *tugging to them, cheering them on* to each characters. Reading the last page left me with a heavy heart. I would not want to let go of that image of Manchester and say goodbye Please don't go yet to the characters that I already became part of my literary world. The world that resides in the recesses of my brain. The world that is known only to me populated by people who I met only in my readings. In terms of writing, Jones extensively use the technique called prolepsis that I first encountered reading Muriel Sparks' The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie (1961). Jones explained this in the interview (appendix of the book) saying that he is the God of those characters so he knows what happened in the life of each characters from the time he\/she was born up to the time his\/her death. The most moving example of this use was with the character of the child Tessie . One fine day of September 1855, their mistress Caldonia saw the 5-y\/o Tessie playing with a wooden toy horse. Caldonia says to the child: That is very nice, Tessie to which Tessie responded, My papa did this for me . In January 2002, on her deathbed, the old Tessie asked her caretaker to get the wooden toy horse from the attic. While holding the toy, she breathed her last saying the same thing: My papa did this for me . My heart stopped beating. Tears welled up in my eyes. That scene is just one of the many moving scenes about those slaves in that time of the history in Virginia when black people were traded like they were not human but properties. I can make this review very long. There are just too many good things I would like to say here but I am afraid that no review can make justice to a book as good as this."

Free blacks owned other black people. Some free blacks bought their family members and others just wanted the slave labor. Native Americans owned slaves for much of the same reasons. The Known World introduces us to some of those people. The Known World has won a whole gang of awards, so we know its an important book and the writing is top notch. My only problems with the book were the fact that there were too many characters. You know this is a pet peeve of mine and I lost track of all the characters in this book. My other problem was that it jumped backwards and forwards in time way too much. Most of the time jumps were super confusing. I liked The Known World but I think I might not be smart enough to read this book. I'll probably reread it sometime in the future and I do recommend to others because its a brilliant book."

        "text":"Basically - a book about slavery in the South. I enjoy those kind of thing, especially The Secret Lives of Bees, but with this one, it felt like the book had no point. While I was reading, I kept on going \"what did I just read? Am I really reading\/understanding this book?\" and kept on referring to the back cover of the book. No. The story was simply what I read. O.......K! Then ugh. I HATE leaving a book unread, so I kept on forcing myself to read thru the whole book. Finally the misery I was putting myself through ended, and UGH! The storyline. The author kept on jumping around the timeline too much - and honestly - I would describe this book as a glimpse of the lives of slaves in the south, but with a blah storyline. However this book has won a pultizer prize. EH!? Anyone out there who has read this book? Your opinions?? However like always, we learn from books. What I got out of this book was a new knowledge I never came upon, that black people owned black slaves.They even buy their own family members, and the slaves were considered as properties, including family. Hmm... History is richier than we will ever know or think of."

        "text":"The Known World does this weird thing: it cites its sources. And it's weird because they don't exist. There are passages like this: [Manchester, VA] went through a period of years and years of what University of Virginia historian Roberta Murphy in a 1948 book would call 'peace and prosperity'. Jones goes on to tell you the publication history of that book, and a few more things about what was in it, and to imply that Roberta Murphy was a little racist. But there is no Roberta Murphy, there is no book, there is no Manchester, VA. What is Jones up to? Wyatt Mason notes : What research on the subject Jones undertook was, in fact, quickly derailed after he happened upon an account of a white slave owner who spent her days abusing one of her black slaves, a little girl, by beating her head against a wall. “If I had wanted to tell the whole story of slavery, Americans couldn’t have taken that,” Jones told an interviewer. “People want to think that there was slavery, and then we got beyond it. People don’t want to hear that a woman would take a child and bang her head against the wall day after day. It’s nice that I didn’t read all those books. What I would have had to put down is far, far harsher and bleaker. Too much of a bummer? It's not that The Known World is a feel-good novel. Ears and Achilles tendons will be sliced. It follows the rules of slavery books: slave narratives always had happy endings; later, fictional slave narratives always have sad endings. But Toni Morrison has a different opinion about what Americans can and can't take. Shit, so does Harriet Jacobs. And Jones knows this, so he's being disingenuous. And you notice that he's talking about books he didn't actually read. NPR says, Jones collected two shelves of books about slavery, but never got around to reading them. Still, the author was able to use his imagination, and stories he had heard growing up, to make his characters come alive. \"I decided the people I'd created were real enough and I had just accumulated enough information about what the world was like in the South before 1865 to allow me to lie and get away with it,\" he says. Look, I don't mean to say Jones isn't telling the truth. I don't know if he is, and neither does he; neither of us read those two shelves of books about slavery. But the citation of imaginary sources in the book itself serves to either add authenticity that's undeserved, or - if you follow up on those sources - underline its lack of authenticity. I'm puzzled by it. This sort of meta-sourcing has been done before - by Nabokov in Pale Fire, by Cervantes, and in its closest parallel by Borges in his first collection, Universal History of Iniquity, which also confused me. It's especially jarring here, maybe just because I find the truth of slavery a fraught subject, and maybe because the layers go so deep - even in interviews about his lack of authenticity, he appears to be consciously inauthentic. I don't know, man, I don't get it. But anyway: is it a good made-up story about made-up people? Yeah, sure, totally. Eventually. The first half is a little annoying. There's a lot of chronological foofarah - skipping all over the place for no pressing reason - and a ginormous cast it's hard to keep track of, and our super-omniscient narrator often takes time out to tell you some trivial character's entire life story, which you didn't really need. But the second half ratchets up the tension to pure shit-your-pantsville, as that sprawling cast all meet their assorted fates. It makes up for some irritation in the first half. So yeah, as a novel it's excellent. The authenticity issue, I bring up mostly because we take this book seriously; it won a Pulitzer. It deserves to be looked carefully at. I looked carefully and I was confused by its truth."

        "text":"Despite some luminous moments where the characters come alive in a special way, this novel about the lives of slaves in a fictional community in Virginia of the 1830s felt too hermetic and sealed off for me to enjoy it as thoroughly as others might. The special hook that the story holds is its rendering of freed blacks who became slave owners themselves. The focus is on one such plantation with about 30 slaves which is struggling to adapt to the death of its black master, Henry Townsend. We get a plausible history along the way of how his father, Augustus, was so talented at furniture making that he bought his own freedom, and state legislative action allowed him to continue residing in the state and eventually bought the freedom of his son. With other free blacks, such as the feisty, condescending teacher Fern, who came from the North, they form a small society of their own. While Augustus abhors slavery, his son tries to emulate the path taken by the whites to economic success by owning slaves. Despite an ambition to become a benevolent master, the corrupting influence of owning people as property is well portrayed. When his lonely widow takes up a love relationship with her plantation foreman, she is replicating the same abuse of power enacted by most other white plantation owners, and the consequences are tragic. The “known world” of plantation life in this fictional county is like an island in time, and the characters themselves seem stuck in it like insects in amber. The omniscient narrator is god-like in passing into the thoughts and dreams of more than a dozen characters. Unfortunately, the reader gets distanced from emotionally connecting to them by the narrator breaking the flow to leap backward and forward in time to reveal some particular fact or person’s fate (for more see: D.D. Wood review ). Ultimately, the human bonds holding people to each other came off as tenuous and unreal as beholding a ship in a bottle. Unlike the romanticized lives portrayed in Hailey’s “Roots”, the characters have no sense of cultural history of their African origins (the word itself appears nowhere in the book), and there is no foreshadowing of plantation life as a doomed phase in history on the path to the Civil War. The idea of a slave revolt is unthinkable, and the one humane white character, Sheriff Skiffington, feels no compunction over diligently carrying out a big part of his job in organizing night patrols and retrieval efforts when “property” runs away. Though we get no sense of the reality of the “Underground Railroad”, we do get a brilliant vision at one point where Augustus ends up mailing a slave girl to Philadelphia in a crate along with a shipment of his hand-carved walking sticks. In an interview with Jones appended to the audiobook version of the novel, he admits he did not do much research for the book and was not concerned about communicating any particular message to his readers about the history of slavery. As the creator of all the characters, he would not admit to favoring any one character over another. Still the reader can’t help but getting the message of how inhumane slavery was and how individuals trapped in it strived to achieve some form of dignity in their lives. Like other reviewers, I didn’t feel I got to know any of the characters well enough to get emotionally engaged with them. When not interrupted by invasions from the narrator, the prose is effective in evoking the place and time, an obvious factor in helping it gain a Pulitzer Prize. Here is a lovely example from the opening for the book: The evening his master dies he worked again well after he ended the day for the other adults, his own wife among them, and sent them back with hunger and tiredness to their cabins. The young ones, his son among them, had been sent out of the fields an hour or so before the adults, to prepare the late supper and, if there was time enough, to play in a few minutes of sun that were left. When he, Moses, finally freed himself of the ancient and brittle harness that connected him to the oldest mule his master owned, all that was left of the sun was a five-inch long memory of red orange laid out in still waves across the horizon between two mountains on the left and one on the right. He had been in the fields for all of fourteen hours. He paused before leaving the fields as the evening quiet wrapped itself about him. The mule quivered, wanting home and rest. Moses closed his eyes and bent down and took a pinch of the soil and ate it with no more thought than if it were a spot of cornbread. …he ate it not only to discover the strengths and weaknesses of the field, but because eating it tied him to the only thing in his small world that meant almost as much as his own life."

        "text":"Glorious account that gets past cliches. The premise is that two slaves in 1840s Virginia bought their freedom, but their son stayed a little too long under the master's care. What does the family do when the son starts his own farm and buys his own slaves? The mastery of Jones' writing comes in the sense of history that he lends to minute objects, chance encounters, and incantatory reveries within a frought landscape. Not content to write an unwritten history of forgotten people, Jones re-writes the histories that have been written, citing documents the purport to explain the historical phenomenon of free blacks who owned slaves. Passages that carry runaway characters to the north also tie in academic treatises from the next century, deeds and warrants and court decisions that attempted to justify white supremacy, and the momentoes that emancipated children carry to their deathbeds. Jones doesn't neglect to include tales of individual transformation, collective redemption, or international implications in this epic. Characters may come and go like fleeting ghosts, yet the marks they leave may remain. When the words of the plantation master and deeds of the escaped overseer have faded into ineffectual memory, we readers are left with both the sense that an institution has gone horribly wrong and that the people within it can be honorably right; even if the results remain unapparent, the promise of future change remains, along with the threat of complacency and neglect. Jones didn't attempt to detail the national debate over slavery that was current at that time. That limitation on his project was probably a good one. It allows us to see the human effects that rhetoric had covered, and allowed him to devote his attentions to demonstrating the range of positions that people could occupy in relation to the institution. Yes, whether you're descended from a slave, a master, a freed man, a black woman passing as white, an unwilling overseer, a treacherous deputy, a conscientious drunk, or an immigrant Irishwoman sold into prostitution, there's something in this book for you - and I wish that I was only joking, but the irony is that there is no irony here, and sincerity is the least of what we have to do, and memory is only the start of making a history that hasn't stopped."

        "text":"Set in antebellum Virginia, a former slave, Henry Townsend, owns fifty acres of land and thirty-three slaves. As the story opens, Townsend is dying. The novel chronicles his life, the lives of his family members, and the lives of people he encountered in the community. The main characters are three-dimensional and feel like real people, with both admirable traits and flaws. Jones employs an omniscient narrator and non-linear storytelling. He weaves together overlapping stories of past and present events, such that the reader knows what happens to these people in the future before knowing what has happened to them in the book’s “present.” There are a great many characters in this book and the list of Dramatis Personae is helpful in keeping them all straight. This novel is based on a lesser known historical fact. While it was not common, it did happen that some free blacks owned slaves. It lends a complexity to the slavery narrative – showing how people can be impacted by society’s strictures and how victims of exploitation could become perpetrators of the same system. This is not a quick and easy read. It feels like being immersed in the life and times of Manchester County, Virginia, in the 1850s. It is an eloquently written condemnation of oppression in any form. This book won the Pulitzer Prize in 2004."

        "text":"2.5-stars, really. here is a perfect example of a books i should love, and yet.... i didn't. the book was a lot of work and, for me, very little reward. i think most of my issues are because of the style\/structure of the novel: * the third-person, omniscient narrator - this was distracting from very early on in the read. i held off judging it. i wanted to trust jones and his choice. * non-linear narrative - i don't tend to have problems with this at all, but i found it super-clunky here. also distracting. * the made-up references - jones would cite sources and details that seemed to lend such an air of gravitas, but none of it is actually real. (i know, i know. this is fiction. a novel. get over it. but it was just kinda weird to me. social commentary inserted into fiction happens. steinbeck did it. teju cole does it. many writers do this. i felt like jones did a crap-ton of research for this book. but then i read this NPR piece . in it, he notes he collected 2 shelves worth of books on slavery... \"but never got around to reading them\" . so this just added to my 'what the?' on the references in the novel and jones' research.) * all of this combined for a really awkward flow, and convoluted storytelling. i felt like it could lose 50-100 pages and be a tighter, better story. in case you think maybe i am a lazy reader - i'm not, i swear! i love nothing more than a meaty, tough read. jones' story is definitely both of these things. he explores the issue of free black people owning slaves in virginia, and he gives us a large cast of active characters. but it all felt so... surface-y. we get the actions and reactions, but we don't really get the motivations or emotions. jones is navigating a morally dodgy landscape, one i would have loved to have gone into more deeply. we are given the horrors and the heartbreaks, but it all felt so detached. and, you know, maybe that is totally on purpose. maybe, for some people, detachment is the only way through such a horrible time in history. jones has collected some serious critical acclaim and recognition over his career. to name a few: he's won the pulitzer, the national book critic's circle award, the PEN\/Hemingway award, a MacArthur genius grant, and the International IMPAC dublin literary award. he's won nearly $1 million in literary awards alone. the man knows what he's doing, and the respect he's earned is fairly universal. the known world is an important story. but is just shining the light on the issues jones raises enough? so now i am back to the should . i should love this book. (it was just okay for me.) people should read this book. (indeed. but this is not a book i will blanket recommend to all.) so, i don't know you guys. i am bummed over this one. and this is a terrible review\/collection of thoughts. maybe i'll become more coherent with some distance and fix this up a bit - but for now i wanted to note down something here. (aside #1 (going to be a bit spoiler-y here): moses confused me. or, rather, his turn to all-of-a-sudden being an asshole was weird. we're going along with moses. he seems like a lovely man. then, halfway into the book, he's a wife-beater, jerkface? where did that come from, and why was he presented like that? the reveal of moses being a not nice man was sudden and odd.) (aside #2: worth noting (was hugely interesting to me) - the cover photo of this edition is © Eudora Welty ! i had no idea about her photographic prowess .)"

        "text":"Here is a book about black slave owners in the antebellum South! My interest was immediately piqued. On top of that, the book has won all sorts of prizes: *Pulitzer Prize for Fiction (2004) *International Dublin Literary Award (2005) *Anisfield-Wolf Book Award (2004) *National Book Critics Circle Award for Fiction (2003) * Hurston\/Wright Legacy Award Nominee for Debut Fiction (\/2004 *National Book Award Finalist for Fiction (2003) I knew I had to give it a try. I am glad I have read it, but to say I like it, would just not be true. It’s OK, so I am giving it two stars. There is no real central character to the story, because he dies right off the bat. It is 1855 when Henry Townsend dies. He is black. He had been a slave, but his parents had bought him his freedom. He leaves behind no children but a wife, Caldonia, a twenty-eight-year-old educated black woman born free, and his property of thirty-three slaves and fifty acres in Manchester County, Virginia. The book is about the hell that breaks loose afterwards, but really what it is about is life in the South during the antebellum era, about the mindset of Blacks and Whites of this era. The story is told by an omniscient narrator—who knows how each character thinks, what has happened to all of them in the past and what will happen to all of them in the future. It is this all-seeing narrator that shapes the entire feel of the story. This narrator knows everything, but he is not particularly adept at cogently telling a story. In one sentence you may switch form the present to the future and back again. In the next sentence you flip back to the past. It is easy to become confused. Character upon character is thrown at you, with little tidbits about their lives in the past, present and future. You are given an entire community of individuals—Whites and Blacks, a Native American or two, those who are free and those who are slaves, a sheriff and his deputy. The omniscient narrator is constantly restating who each one is, which is good in one sense, but the flow of the tale becomes jerky. Stop and start, backward and forward and often confusing. Use of the omniscient narrator is pushed to the extreme. It is kind of nice to have a character or two to guide you through a story. You do not have that here. There are a whole group of characters, characters that are hard to attach yourself to. You do not get close to any one individual. In the afterword the author points out that he wanted to draw characters that were neither all good nor all bad, each one different in their own way. You do get that here, but you fail to feel anything for any of them. What you do get is a strong sense of being one of a large community. You are there, one among many, living in the antebellum South. This does give one a hands-on feeling of life then and there and how people were thinking. Kevin Free narrates the audiobook. It is simple to follow, the speed is fine and he intonations are well done. The narration performance is good so I have given the narration three stars."

        "text":"I attended a workshop with some friends during which we all went around the room and recommended books that really moved us that year. I don't remember which book I suggested then, but I recall one woman in particular who really loved this book (or I believe she was more in love with Edward Jones' writing). At the end of the workshop we had a gift exchange raffle and she included this book as her contribution. I was the lucky recipient of this free copy. I was interested in this historical novel set in a fictional place in Virginia during the antebellum era, about a former slave who ends up owning slaves. The strangeness of the story and the angle it takes as a slave narrative is intriguing. Also appealing is the way the omniscient narration allows the reader to approach the story without the moral judgement one reserves for this kind of story, since the distance of the narration allows one to realize quickly what the story tries to showcase: how slavery has already poisoned the integrity of all involved. The framework of the novel is composed of anecdotal stories within stories, with pacing often interrupted for a mini scene or two, or an introduction of yet another character who may reappear later or simply disappear. Put another way, it is a book of puzzle pieces: one is added, taken away, another picked up, oh yes, there's the whole, whoops, maybe not, here goes another piece. So although I admired the writing and story setup in the beginning, I just was not in the right space to complete this novel. It has been a while since I added a book to my \"did-not-finish\" list; alas, this one has just made the list. This is not a failed attempt at reading this novel, however, because I remember not being able to finish Ngugi wa Thiong'o's Wizard of the Crow only to later fall in love with his novel, Petals of Blood . With that in mind, I look forward to reading Jones' Lost in the City ."

While not exactly removing race from the issue of slavery, Jones is able to show that even among African-Americans the perniciousness of slavery could damn a generation. The best summary of this idea came from a NYTimes review: 'There are few certified villains in this novel, white or black, because slavery poisons moral judgments at the root. As Jones shows, slavery corrupts good intentions and underwrites bad ones, yet allows decency the odd occasion -- but only by creating such an enormous need for it.' The pacing and structure of this novel could be a little challenging to some, but I found that it fit the narrative perfectly. This isn't a novel that burns you with its quotable sentences, but it scars you with its images. There were periods in it where I thought I was reading a Cormac McCarthy novel. That alone is high praise."

        "text":"When Toni Morrison began her research for \"Beloved,\" she discovered a trove of ghastly instruments. She knew, of course, that slaves were routinely whipped, starved, raped, and hanged, but the existence of specially forged tools was a surprise: metal bits forced down the throat, iron masks locked across the face, spiked collars clasped around the neck. Her Pulitzer Prize-winning novel reintroduced those horrors into the national memory and did much to demonstrate that the cruelties of slavery extended far beyond hard labor and physical deprivation. \"The Known World,\" by Edward Jones, reclaims another peculiarity of American slavery and in the process illustrates yet again that we can't under- estimate its perverse contortions of the human spirit. Bizarre as it sounds, in Louisiana, Virginia, and South Carolina, a small number of free blacks owned their own plantations - and their own slaves. It was a precarious arrangement, to be sure. Blacks who were freed or managed to buy their own freedom had little incentive to tarry in the South. The laws governing their status and their right to hold property were ambiguous and easy for any white person to shred. Jones uses this fragile situation as the setting for a novel about a group of black and white Virginians who tried - sometimes nobly, often viciously - to maintain their world in the face of inevitable collapse. To the extent that Morrison spun a surreal tale of American slavery into mythic proportions, Jones has carved a companion series of stark anecdotes into national legends. In a measured voice that never rises to reflect the agonies and absurdities he describes, he moves back and forth through decades and across state lines, assembling an apparently random collection of brief scenes that gradually fuse into a stunning portrait of moral confusion. The story revolves around Henry Townsend, a black man who, with the indulgence of his former owner, managed to buy his own farm and his own slaves - eventually 29 adults and a collection of children. Henry's parents, who labored tirelessly to free him as a child, are horrified by his participation in the flesh market, but Henry is ambitious, and, what's more, he learned from his master that \"once you own even one, you will never be alone.\" As a protection against loneliness and a way to wealth, Henry can't imagine anything more successful, and he's convinced he can be \"a better master than any white man he had ever known.\" Indeed, he attains that dubious goal, creating a plantation with forced labor that's largely free of physical beatings, but it's an insidious gentility that only camouflages the humiliations of Southern slavery. Nevertheless, his untimely death frightens most of his slaves, who know just how delicate their relative comfort is. Only the brooding overseer, Moses, the first slave Henry ever bought, sees his master's demise as an opportunity - not for freedom, but for taking his place. Indeed, what interests Jones most in this complex novel is the way slavery distorts judgment, not just of those who oppress, but of those who are oppressed. Henry's widow, Caldonia, quickly decides against freeing \"her legacy,\" choosing instead to maintain the plantation in the spirit of Henry's gentle example. \"Her husband had done the best he could,\" she thinks, \"and on Judgment Day his slaves would stand before God and testify to that fact.\" Occasionally, a child is worked to death or a pregnant woman labors in the field till she miscarries, but Caldonia sheds sincere tears, comforts the parents, and considers whether she should buy insurance against further losses of her property. As a single woman with a large business to run, she's encouraged by a collection of family and friends, other free blacks, some of whom own their own slaves, too. One of the most troubling is Fern, Caldonia's prim teacher of literature and etiquette. Together, they keep the irony of their position well buried, while socializing in a kind of racial terrarium maintained by William Robbins, the county's wealthiest white farmer. Estranged from his own wife but protected by his political power, he loves a black woman in town and openly adores his two mulatto children. The Townsend plantation with its little coterie of free slave-owning blacks gives his favorites a place to play and refine themselves. In one of several shifts to the late 19th century, a Canadian historian interviews Fern, Caldonia's teacher, about those days on the plantation. \"All of us do only what the law and God tell us we can do,\" she says without any hint of guilt or remorse. \"We owned slaves. It was what was done, and so that is what we did.\" Jones uses that same tone of historical distance throughout, a tone that amplifies the grotesque mingling of affection and cruelty that infected these people, black and white. In the center of this moral kaleidoscope stands the sheriff, John Skiffington, an earnest Christian, dedicated to the objective application of law and convinced that \"the law always cares\" for everyone equally. It's a doomed endeavor, of course, but as Caldonia's plantation begins to collapse, Skiffington fails to realize that the legal system he's sworn to uphold is not objective and that he cannot remain clean within it. The scrambled collection of events and characters makes this a difficult story to enter, but that structure eventually accounts for much of the novel's evocative power. Jones has a kind of biblical style that suggests whole lives in a few stark details from a perspective that's alternately microscopic and telescopic. It's a technique that resists our efforts to keep these events in some unrecoverable past. The troubling implications of his story leach in through hairline cracks all over the twin shells of antebellum nostalgia and Northern piety. Every time Caldonia cheerfully reminds her friends, \"We are all worthy of one another,\" the legacy of slavery sounds more complex and unresolved. http:\/\/www.csmonitor.com\/2003\/0814\/p1..."

After reading The Known World, however, you'd be forgiven if you thought you could take a tour of it's plantations and slave cemetaries on your vacation to colonial Williamsburg. The complicated pre-civil war Southern society that Edward P. Jones creates feels as real and surreal as any factual history of slavery you've read. It was not so much the story of Henry Townsend, a black slave owner, and all the people that his death allows us to meet that engaged me. It was the world, a world where I could taste the soil I might till and the women I might marry and the terrible choices I might be faced with, that put it's claws in me and refused to let go. It took me nearly 2 months to finish the book's 388 pages. It should've been a quick read. It is a fascinating place with peculiar problems and characters I cried for on more than one occasion. It should've been a quick read but I kept asking myself this question: who would I have been? The slave, toiling away in the field? The overseer, unable to see the world for what it truly was? The freed man, working desperately to free the rest of his family? The smart child, taken under the wing of the rich white slave owner and convinced that there was nothing wrong with owning another human being? The broken black man tortured by his family's wealth built on the backs of men and women that look just like me? The slave too proud, too strong, too powerful to let another take his freedom? Who would I have been? Who am I now? In matters of race, there is always that fool's point, usually made by a white person (though not always) that asks,\"why aren't you over it, already? Can't we just let it go?\" It is a way to end an uncomfortable conversation. The reasons don't matter. I know many a person for which the sticky tar baby of race in America is simply a discussion they can't stick their hands in. It is too difficult. Too raw. Too cloudy to be sure that people will remain friends after an honest chat. The way I feel when I read books like The Known World is my answer. No matter how well-adjusted, how integrated, how loving of my fellow man, how multiculti kumbayah I am, I'm not over it. I can't let it go. This fictional world was very real not all that long ago. It's effects still ripple through our every day. The world I know doesn't exist without it. Highly highly recommended."

        "text":"there is that old adage that a good book will tell you how to read it. and i have no idea to whom that should be attributed, only that my undergrad professors seemed to have been born to quote that thought endlessly: in my gothic lit class, my enlightenment class, my victorian lit class... the african and irish lit professors mostly kept their mouths shut on the subject. but the rest - hoo boy - did they love to drag that old chestnut out... and it makes sense, to a certain degree. but this book doesn't tell you how to read it so much as it presents itself to the reader, like a fat man in a speedo lolling around on an undersized towel saying, \"look at me ladies, you like it?? this is what you get!!\" it almost demands that you read it and like it. but i was disobedient. every sentence, every paragraph, seemed to be trying to contain multitudes. and i am a fan of \"thick\" writing, but the manner in which this book presented itself quickly soured on me. there were too many stories or episodes ending with, \"years from now, when celia was on her deathbed, she would think back to her third year of marriage\",in a scene where she has yet to even be married, or right after two characters are introduced to each other, \"this would be the last time they would meet until the hailstorm of aught-six\" - and i am making up all the names and situations here, but you get an idea of the shape of my complaints. it's constant foreshadowing and some of the foreshadowing is just teasing, as the events never come to pass in the novel itself. it's like sitting down to tea with a god in his dotage, rambling and making connections only he can understand; seeing the past and future simultaneously. \"hey, karen, didn't you really like that kjaerstaad trilogy, where he basically did what you are complaining about here??\" yeah, what? so? shut up - isn't it past your bedtime?? yeah, but sure, that's true. but for some reason, it bothered me here. all i wanted was a straightforward linear narrative about a fascinating subject matter: free black men and women who owned slaves. when i read roll of thunder, hear my cry last summer, the whole transition period between slavery and freedom really excited my brainparts. i dunno. and mister jones was a real sweetheart when he came for the new yorker festival and i waited in line to get a book signed for a friend and i really wanted to like it because it seems like a nice fat sprawling sweeping story the way i like, but i just got lost in the names and the timeline and my confusion turned into apathy. it's like this guy you date who seems really perfect - he is smart and looks like gabriel byrne and he dotes on you and everything is fun and on paper it all looks great and you know you should really like him, but he just doesn't make you laugh so you run off and leave him for a rockstar. you know? because i feel like i should like this one because it is award-winning, and my experience with the african-american novel is middling (although i love the african novel, the west indian novel and the afro-canadian novel - go figure) so i feel like as someone who appreciates literature in general, i should totally love this. but it wasn't there for me. oh, chris wilson, i am sorry. now you are going to want full custody because your baby is being raised among heathens. years from now, when my and chris wilson's book-baby became the mayor of littleton, he would read this review and a tear of sorrow would come to his eye at my short-sightedness. come to my blog!"

        "text":"I know this is a critically acclaimed book, a Pulitzer winner, and a book tackling a difficult and complex stain on America history: slavery and black slave owners. There are moments when the book does say some interesting things or reveal some unsavory and uncomfortable truths, but it was so hard to engage with as a reader. I mean, I hung in with DFW through the first 600 pages of Infinite Jest where nothing happens -- but because I was fascinated by Hal, Orin, Marathe, Steeply, and Mario and Madame Psychosis who all fascinated me. There were literally dozens of other characters but these all pulled me in. In The Known World, there are also dozens of characters but none that I grew any attachment too. It was as if the author Jones was using a hand-held camera and no stabilizer so that the images were jumpy and out of focus. It reminded me sometimes of how the world seems to my myopic eyes between taking off my glasses in the morning and putting in my contact lenses. The narration also highly annoyed me. All the parenthetical \"in 60 years so and so will do such as such\" were meaningless because I was given neither enough time nor enough detail to give a shit. Further, there is this reference to \"years later they would all turn into human torches in front of the dry foods store\", but no mention afterwards of to what this referred. But the most annoying bit was in using the Canadian journalist frame at about page 130 or so (which then only briefly appears in the narrative 200 pages later in a parenthetical throwaway comment, it is said that the journalist would never marry his heart's desire yet 3 pages later, they marry and that coming to talk to Fern that there was some incomprehensible stuff that happens off-screen that morning (also never adequately explained) and so she was not going to open up to the journalist and yet we still find her filling in details about Henry, Moses and Caledonia 30 pages later. Too much inconsistency - was the editor asleep or stoned and missed these? So, despite taking on a complex subject, Jones is no Faulkner as his South does not eve approach that of the Great William. He is not as good as Pynchon or DFW is manipulating time and space in a narrative that was 100 or 150 pages too long and felt it, and he is not Alice Walker or Toni Morrison who brought us the most amazing, poignant, and powerful images of slavery and its residual impacts generations later that I have ever read. So, read Beloved or Absalom, Absalom if you want to hear about the South and I expect you will be less frustrated, but every bit enraged at this deplorable institution that is a cancer on the American past."

        "text":"Ambitious, Interesting, Disorganized In an interview, Edward P. Jones revealed that The Known World took shape around 1) when he heard that Black people had owned slaves and 2) when he read a thin paperback in high school about a Jewish man who decided to join the Nazi party, how he acted in opposition to how one would expect. The Known World is an ambitious novel which aims to describe the world of 1855 where Henry Townsend has recently died. As a result of his death, a cloud of uncertainty hangs in the air as he leaves behind his widow, Caldonia, and the undetermined fate of the slaves he purchased to work his land. Although the plot is interesting, this book is disorganized. It covers many different characters and rapidly shifts time periods. I would be reading along and then the text would say “and this person lived to be 93 years old and had 235 grandchildren.” (paraphrasing) Countless times, I had to stop and reread because the storytelling was so clunky. In The Known World, there are quite a few references to Adam and Eve, even references to Milton (Paradise Lost). My favorite author, Philip Pullman, loves to talk about this topic and how in his works he wanted his characters to find their way back to The Garden by taking the long way around. So this quote on page 329 stood out: “There was a long way around but he chose not to take it.” There is a character in The Known World by the name of Anderson Frazier. He creates and distributes pamphlets and interviews Fern Elston. In my opinion, this pamphlet could have provided a framework to systematically organize the characters instead of the resulting jumbled and confusing soup of characters and timelines. The Known World has some unforgettable moments, but the organization of the narrative reduces the enjoyment of the reading experience.

        "text":"This is a complex novel, with dense writing, a non-linear structure, and an abundance of characters. It reads much like a true historical account of a place, Manchester County, Virginia, and time, pre-Civil War 1800s. This could very nearly have passed for a non-fiction book; each character feels so real, their personal stories and histories so authentic. The author even goes so far as to tell us what happens to many of them ten, twenty or even fifty years in the future. And yet, Edward P. Jones himself states: \"The county and town of Manchester, Virginia, and every human being in those places, are products of my imagination… The census records I made up for Manchester were, again, simply to make the reader feel that the town and the county and the people lived and breathed in central Virginia once upon a time…\" Well, consider me duped. At first I really thought such a county existed and the data presented were genuine facts. As my son passed through the living room, I even shouted out some sort of statistic or another and asked if he had ever read about such a thing in his history classes. He couldn’t recall, but it sounded ‘familiar’. Right, because much of this could have been true, yet it wasn’t. The institution of slavery of course was all too real and cruel, and that’s what this book is about, and this is the truth. Slavery in all its forms is evil. Henry Townsend is a black farmer. He is a former slave that with the purchase of freedom and some land becomes a slave owner himself. Henry and his wife Caldonia own a small plantation near the border of his former master’s much larger one. I could not wrap my head around why on earth a freed man would ever want to enslave another human being. Henry and other black slave owners like him justify their actions: \"Henry had always said that he wanted to be a better master than any white man he had ever known. He did not understand that the kind of world he wanted to create was doomed before he had even spoken the first syllable of the word master.\" Well, as the old saying goes, ‘the road to hell is paved with good intentions.’ When Henry dies, all hell breaks loose, and we begin to see the ill-fated consequences of an institution that is immoral and corrupt. A narrative that seems to jump around in time and between characters eventually comes together into a whole as consequences and events snowball out of control. Lives are permanently changed. Some for the worst, others (we hope) for the better. They all become woven together much like the massive tapestry hanging on the wall of another place in another time. Each is part of the story. Everyone is responsible for the events which passed, were allowed to pass despite the huge injustice to humanity. This book is not easy to read. The structure is challenging and the topic is gloomy, albeit important. What happens to the people we grow to care for is often horrifying and heartbreaking. But it is well-written and extremely impactful. An important novel which is well worth your time and attention if you are up for the challenge. It won't suit everyone, but if you are at all interested, I encourage you to pick this one up. \"What I feared most at that moment is what I still fear: that they would remember my history, that I, no matter what I had always said to the contrary, owned people of our Race.\""

I really thought when we got together that we would have a brief but mutually satisfying relationship. I'd read you, you'd provide enlightenment or emotional catharsis or entertainment, maybe even all three. All the signs were there: the laudatory quotes on your jacket, a shocking and unexpected premise, high marks on goodreads. But something was just off by the end of the first chapter. Maybe it was the masturbation scene right at the start. Or the characters that I just couldn't get into - I could hardly tell some of them apart. Or the way the narrative seemed to skip all over without any focus. Maybe I just didn't give you enough pages. I'm sure you got better as you went along. I mean, look at all the four- and five-star reviews you've gotten! But every time I picked you up my thoughts turned to the three other books on my bedside table that I'd rather be reading. I haven't actually been unfaithful, but that's just not a healthy basis for a relationship. So after 72 pages, I'm putting you down. Don't feel too bad. Focus on all those other, good reviews and maybe we'll meet again someday when the stars all align just right. But probably not.

        "text":"There’s irony that I read more than half of this wrenching, ugly, hopeful, stirring, and grievous book while holding a sleeping baby in my arms. Because there is a lot of life and death in this take on pre-Civil War Virginia. I knew little about the book except that the author wrote it after reading about freed Black folks owning slaves. In delving into this issue, which in any modern conversation circle must bring dissonance, disbelief, and maybe even disgust, I became increasingly moved and disturbed. A difficult book, both because it’s an unflinching look at slavery, but also because it’s written in a James Joyce-ish style — lots of asides and stream of consciousness text. The author careens from generation to generation and back again in often the same paragraph. Yet it worked for me. It reads like a memoir of an entire county’s 150-year history complete with dozens of families represented. What results is simply, UNFORGETTABLE. There are characters whose faces I imagined while reading and characters whose stories I became invested in that will haunt me. Not in the truth of a fictional characterization but more because the ugliness of humanity was so blatantly on display and sadly remains real to this day. As I bid farewell to the slaves, slaveowners, children of both and ministers, sheriffs and patrollers of this novel, I will not forget their names. And I can’t help but wonder who would I have been in Manchester County, Virginia? (Reviewed 2\/12\/25)"

        "text":"I'm going to have to rave a bit, because this is one of the best books I've read in the past ten years. Jones packs in all the historical detail you could want, and of course he's hit on a subject--black slaveowners--that in and of itself is tabloid-sensational. Where lesser writers might lean too hard on the sensational aspect (or rely on it to bolster an otherwise weak narrative), Jones works it into a compelling and powerful story. What makes it so powerful is a mix of fascinating characters who are woven into a series of overlapping plotlines. For me it's the structuring that is so brilliant (geek alert: I actually diagrammed the time shifts in the chapters as an exercise, to see when and how Jones yoked the whole thing together). This less than linear approach might be frustrating to those who just want things to be straightforward, but stick with it: the shifts provide suspense as well as texture, and they propel more than one storyline at once. They do all come together, trust me. I also admire the overarching authorial voice in the novel, which certainly leans toward the formal, but also comes across as aware of the history it's grappling with: here and there Jones projects his voice forward for a moment, or seemingly digresses with factual material and research. Again it's all part of the tapestry and the mix, and I also think that the level of narrative awareness (which never disengages long enough to derail anything) adds another layer to the very idea of history--making the whole historical and contemporary both. And for those of you who can do without all of the above writerly blather (a thousand pardons), you'll find in this book characters who are engaging, ignorant, cruel, earnest, sympathetic, tragic, hopeful, flawed--in short, complicated. Halfway through you'll be fighting off the impulse to skip ahead to learn everyone's fate. Finally, I'll say that this book isn't perfect--there are aspects of what I've described above that sometimes don't work: narrative turns that do seem pointless digressions, a character or two a bit stereotypical or annoying. No matter. This book aims high, as brilliant works of art do, and the result is nothing short of amazing."

        "text":"This book demands that you read it slowly and intently. Like eating a huge Thanksgiving dinner, you need to pause and digest before you have the next course. At the outset, the plot seems to be all over the place, bouncing from character to character, telling too many stories, not telling enough and then seeming to tell too much. Ah, but then, you make a little progress and the rhythm begins to assert itself, the stories begin to weave together, the minute details begin to become a diorama, the picture stops being a blur and comes into sharp focus. This isn’t one man’s story, or even the story of one place, this is the story of all men and this is the tale of a world. This book is not so much about race as it is about the abject insanity and evil of the institution of slavery, wherever it is found, whoever is practicing it. In this system, there are free black masters holding black slaves, some of them well-meaning, but it does not make the practice any less immoral. There are white men who love their black mistresses and the children they bear, but it does not remove the fact that they hold a dominion over them that is not borne of love in any of its guises. There are also individuals who are victims of the system and others who refuse to be victims of the system, even at the cost of their lives. I loved many of Jones’ characters, notably Augustus and Mildred Townsend. They exemplify what is the best in us. I felt sorry for some of them, like Sheriff John Skiffington, who would like to be better than this society allows him to be, and Caldonia Townsend’s brother, Calvin, who wishes to go to New York so that he will not have to bear witness to the cruelties around him, cruelties he must realized have escaped him only because of a trick of fortune. I despised some of them, and I recognized most of them. The petty and jealous, who must have dominion over someone to feel they have worth; the ungrateful and traitorous, who would turn upon a friend to put some silver in their own pockets; the meek and hopeless, who bow to the yoke and try simply to find a corner in which they are allowed to exist; the defiant and strong-minded, who fight with their last breath because to do otherwise is to prop up the indefensible; all are here. What I loved most about this novel is its genuineness, its lack of exaggeration or hyperbole, where surely none is needed, its emphasis on the day-to-day injustice of an institution that is accepted as insurmountable or even correct only because it is what is. Edward P. Jones has leveled an attack at the heart of mankind and defied one to imagine what they would have done, what they would have dared to do, in such a place and time."

        "text":"A very complex and beautiful, compelling book about Henry, a former slave who becomes a slave owner, & his wife Caldonia. But they're just the start - the book is really a series of stories & vignettes about the families, friends, neighbors & community surrounding Henry & Caldonia. It took me a really long time to get into the book, because there are so many characters, some important & some not, & the book jumps around in time, making it difficult to follow. Trust me, use the cast of characters at the end of this edition (why not place this at the beginning?!) & give up your expectations about traditional narrative format, & you'll LOVE this book as much as I did. In life, we have our own story kind of playing in our head, & at the same time we have all these other stories we're hearing - the story about your mother's great-uncle. The story about your brother in law's neighbor. The one about your sister's husband's aunt & her neighbor. the one about your coworker's mother. You know all those stories? That's what this book is like - some characters are more important than others, so you hear more of their stories, but minor characters have stories too, & they sort of appear out of nowhere, & you get to hear their story, & then they're gone. It's really very cool! I particularly loved the story of the womanizing slave who has a vision during a lightning storm\/tornado - & becomes the founder of an orphanage. And the little tiny story about the family who don't want to give up their cow, & the woman goes into the barn to milk the cow & there's this lovely description of her squirting the cow's milk into a cat's mouth, & if you've ever seen a cat eat with true contentment you will recognize the cat body language that Jones describes. Toward the end of the book there's a very powerful scene where a character, who isn't a particularly \"good\" character, says there should be a lantern or light of truth in the world, an actual place where people can stand & tell the truth without fear of retribution, where one might be able to right a wrong. It's a moment where you think, yes this guy could right the wrong by speaking out, because his fear of having people think he's \"on the negro's side\" is...well, wrong! But that's his fear & in that moment of the book you understand it & you think, yeah, what if he could speak out under that light of truth & not have anyone judge him? How wonderful would that be? While the book depicts the horrors of slavery, & there are a few characters who are outright despicable, there are many shades of gray in Jones' vision as well. It's a book that will make you think about slavery, the myths & realities & tragedies of it all, & on top of that it'll make you think about your own life & all the people you've known & how complex & interesting we all are, really. It's beautifully written & the characters will stick in your head as if you'd known them too. Oddly, I think what I initially disliked most about this book - its multitude of characters & convoluted timeline - is what I ended up really enjoying! Another example of a book that made my head expand, with some creakiness, but I'm glad the expansion can still happen!"

        "text":"In this book I learned that there used to be black slaveholders in the US. I thought that only white people were allowed to own slaves during the time that owning slaves were like owning properties. During that pre-Abolition time. During those sad dark days in the American history. Black Edward P. Jones (born 1951) wrote this historical epic novel, The Known World based on the not well known fact that there were some black slaveholders (black people owning black slaves) in the state of Virginia during the time in the US when owning slave is legal. Wikipedia has this to say: \"Slavery in the United States was a form of unfree labor which existed as a legal institution in North America for more than a century before the founding of the United States in 1776, and continued mostly in the South until the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution in 1865.[1] The first English colony in North America, Virginia, first imported Africans in 1619, a practice earlier established in the Spanish colonies as early as the 1560s.[2] Most slaves were black and were held by whites, although some Native Americans and free blacks also held slaves; there were a small number of white slaves as well.[3]\" Winner of the 2004 Pulitzer Award for Fiction, The Known World is one of the most memorable reads I had this year. It is not an easy book to read. This 388-page novel left me with a heavy chest each time I closed the book. Each page is gloomy and sad. The novel is well-told with lyrical prose creating a big canvas of imagery in one's mind while reading. In that big canvas are memorable and three-dimensional numerous characters most of them black slaves. No character is downright bad or good. The detailed description of the sceneries of a fictional county called Manchester and the true depictions of the characters are exceptionally striking that I had to slow down in my reading to savor the story and hold on *tugging to them, cheering them on* to each characters. Reading the last page left me with a heavy heart. I would not want to let go of that image of Manchester and say goodbye Please don't go yet to the characters that I already became part of my literary world. The world that resides in the recesses of my brain. The world that is known only to me populated by people who I met only in my readings. In terms of writing, Jones extensively use the technique called prolepsis that I first encountered reading Muriel Sparks' The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie (1961). Jones explained this in the interview (appendix of the book) saying that he is the God of those characters so he knows what happened in the life of each characters from the time he\/she was born up to the time his\/her death. The most moving example of this use was with the character of the child Tessie . One fine day of September 1855, their mistress Caldonia saw the 5-y\/o Tessie playing with a wooden toy horse. Caldonia says to the child: That is very nice, Tessie to which Tessie responded, My papa did this for me . In January 2002, on her deathbed, the old Tessie asked her caretaker to get the wooden toy horse from the attic. While holding the toy, she breathed her last saying the same thing: My papa did this for me . My heart stopped beating. Tears welled up in my eyes. That scene is just one of the many moving scenes about those slaves in that time of the history in Virginia when black people were traded like they were not human but properties. I can make this review very long. There are just too many good things I would like to say here but I am afraid that no review can make justice to a book as good as this."

Free blacks owned other black people. Some free blacks bought their family members and others just wanted the slave labor. Native Americans owned slaves for much of the same reasons. The Known World introduces us to some of those people. The Known World has won a whole gang of awards, so we know its an important book and the writing is top notch. My only problems with the book were the fact that there were too many characters. You know this is a pet peeve of mine and I lost track of all the characters in this book. My other problem was that it jumped backwards and forwards in time way too much. Most of the time jumps were super confusing. I liked The Known World but I think I might not be smart enough to read this book. I'll probably reread it sometime in the future and I do recommend to others because its a brilliant book."

O.......K! Then ugh. I HATE leaving a book unread, so I kept on forcing myself to read thru the whole book. Finally the misery I was putting myself through ended, and UGH! The storyline. The author kept on jumping around the timeline too much - and honestly - I would describe this book as a glimpse of the lives of slaves in the south, but with a blah storyline. However this book has won a pultizer prize. EH!? Anyone out there who has read this book? Your opinions?? However like always, we learn from books. What I got out of this book was a new knowledge I never came upon, that black people owned black slaves.They even buy their own family members, and the slaves were considered as properties, including family. Hmm... History is richier than we will ever know or think of."

        "text":"The Known World does this weird thing: it cites its sources. And it's weird because they don't exist. There are passages like this: [Manchester, VA] went through a period of years and years of what University of Virginia historian Roberta Murphy in a 1948 book would call 'peace and prosperity'. Jones goes on to tell you the publication history of that book, and a few more things about what was in it, and to imply that Roberta Murphy was a little racist. But there is no Roberta Murphy, there is no book, there is no Manchester, VA. What is Jones up to? Wyatt Mason notes : What research on the subject Jones undertook was, in fact, quickly derailed after he happened upon an account of a white slave owner who spent her days abusing one of her black slaves, a little girl, by beating her head against a wall. “If I had wanted to tell the whole story of slavery, Americans couldn’t have taken that,” Jones told an interviewer. “People want to think that there was slavery, and then we got beyond it. People don’t want to hear that a woman would take a child and bang her head against the wall day after day. It’s nice that I didn’t read all those books. What I would have had to put down is far, far harsher and bleaker. Too much of a bummer? It's not that The Known World is a feel-good novel. Ears and Achilles tendons will be sliced. It follows the rules of slavery books: slave narratives always had happy endings; later, fictional slave narratives always have sad endings. But Toni Morrison has a different opinion about what Americans can and can't take. Shit, so does Harriet Jacobs. And Jones knows this, so he's being disingenuous. And you notice that he's talking about books he didn't actually read. NPR says, Jones collected two shelves of books about slavery, but never got around to reading them. Still, the author was able to use his imagination, and stories he had heard growing up, to make his characters come alive. \"I decided the people I'd created were real enough and I had just accumulated enough information about what the world was like in the South before 1865 to allow me to lie and get away with it,\" he says. Look, I don't mean to say Jones isn't telling the truth. I don't know if he is, and neither does he; neither of us read those two shelves of books about slavery. But the citation of imaginary sources in the book itself serves to either add authenticity that's undeserved, or - if you follow up on those sources - underline its lack of authenticity. I'm puzzled by it. This sort of meta-sourcing has been done before - by Nabokov in Pale Fire, by Cervantes, and in its closest parallel by Borges in his first collection, Universal History of Iniquity, which also confused me. It's especially jarring here, maybe just because I find the truth of slavery a fraught subject, and maybe because the layers go so deep - even in interviews about his lack of authenticity, he appears to be consciously inauthentic. I don't know, man, I don't get it. But anyway: is it a good made-up story about made-up people? Yeah, sure, totally. Eventually. The first half is a little annoying. There's a lot of chronological foofarah - skipping all over the place for no pressing reason - and a ginormous cast it's hard to keep track of, and our super-omniscient narrator often takes time out to tell you some trivial character's entire life story, which you didn't really need. But the second half ratchets up the tension to pure shit-your-pantsville, as that sprawling cast all meet their assorted fates. It makes up for some irritation in the first half. So yeah, as a novel it's excellent. The authenticity issue, I bring up mostly because we take this book seriously; it won a Pulitzer. It deserves to be looked carefully at. I looked carefully and I was confused by its truth."

        "text":"Despite some luminous moments where the characters come alive in a special way, this novel about the lives of slaves in a fictional community in Virginia of the 1830s felt too hermetic and sealed off for me to enjoy it as thoroughly as others might. The special hook that the story holds is its rendering of freed blacks who became slave owners themselves. The focus is on one such plantation with about 30 slaves which is struggling to adapt to the death of its black master, Henry Townsend. We get a plausible history along the way of how his father, Augustus, was so talented at furniture making that he bought his own freedom, and state legislative action allowed him to continue residing in the state and eventually bought the freedom of his son. With other free blacks, such as the feisty, condescending teacher Fern, who came from the North, they form a small society of their own. While Augustus abhors slavery, his son tries to emulate the path taken by the whites to economic success by owning slaves. Despite an ambition to become a benevolent master, the corrupting influence of owning people as property is well portrayed. When his lonely widow takes up a love relationship with her plantation foreman, she is replicating the same abuse of power enacted by most other white plantation owners, and the consequences are tragic. The “known world” of plantation life in this fictional county is like an island in time, and the characters themselves seem stuck in it like insects in amber. The omniscient narrator is god-like in passing into the thoughts and dreams of more than a dozen characters. Unfortunately, the reader gets distanced from emotionally connecting to them by the narrator breaking the flow to leap backward and forward in time to reveal some particular fact or person’s fate (for more see: D.D. Wood review ). Ultimately, the human bonds holding people to each other came off as tenuous and unreal as beholding a ship in a bottle. Unlike the romanticized lives portrayed in Hailey’s “Roots”, the characters have no sense of cultural history of their African origins (the word itself appears nowhere in the book), and there is no foreshadowing of plantation life as a doomed phase in history on the path to the Civil War. The idea of a slave revolt is unthinkable, and the one humane white character, Sheriff Skiffington, feels no compunction over diligently carrying out a big part of his job in organizing night patrols and retrieval efforts when “property” runs away. Though we get no sense of the reality of the “Underground Railroad”, we do get a brilliant vision at one point where Augustus ends up mailing a slave girl to Philadelphia in a crate along with a shipment of his hand-carved walking sticks. In an interview with Jones appended to the audiobook version of the novel, he admits he did not do much research for the book and was not concerned about communicating any particular message to his readers about the history of slavery. As the creator of all the characters, he would not admit to favoring any one character over another. Still the reader can’t help but getting the message of how inhumane slavery was and how individuals trapped in it strived to achieve some form of dignity in their lives. Like other reviewers, I didn’t feel I got to know any of the characters well enough to get emotionally engaged with them. When not interrupted by invasions from the narrator, the prose is effective in evoking the place and time, an obvious factor in helping it gain a Pulitzer Prize. Here is a lovely example from the opening for the book: The evening his master dies he worked again well after he ended the day for the other adults, his own wife among them, and sent them back with hunger and tiredness to their cabins. The young ones, his son among them, had been sent out of the fields an hour or so before the adults, to prepare the late supper and, if there was time enough, to play in a few minutes of sun that were left. When he, Moses, finally freed himself of the ancient and brittle harness that connected him to the oldest mule his master owned, all that was left of the sun was a five-inch long memory of red orange laid out in still waves across the horizon between two mountains on the left and one on the right. He had been in the fields for all of fourteen hours. He paused before leaving the fields as the evening quiet wrapped itself about him. The mule quivered, wanting home and rest. Moses closed his eyes and bent down and took a pinch of the soil and ate it with no more thought than if it were a spot of cornbread. …he ate it not only to discover the strengths and weaknesses of the field, but because eating it tied him to the only thing in his small world that meant almost as much as his own life."

        "text":"Glorious account that gets past cliches. The premise is that two slaves in 1840s Virginia bought their freedom, but their son stayed a little too long under the master's care. What does the family do when the son starts his own farm and buys his own slaves? The mastery of Jones' writing comes in the sense of history that he lends to minute objects, chance encounters, and incantatory reveries within a frought landscape. Not content to write an unwritten history of forgotten people, Jones re-writes the histories that have been written, citing documents the purport to explain the historical phenomenon of free blacks who owned slaves. Passages that carry runaway characters to the north also tie in academic treatises from the next century, deeds and warrants and court decisions that attempted to justify white supremacy, and the momentoes that emancipated children carry to their deathbeds. Jones doesn't neglect to include tales of individual transformation, collective redemption, or international implications in this epic. Characters may come and go like fleeting ghosts, yet the marks they leave may remain. When the words of the plantation master and deeds of the escaped overseer have faded into ineffectual memory, we readers are left with both the sense that an institution has gone horribly wrong and that the people within it can be honorably right; even if the results remain unapparent, the promise of future change remains, along with the threat of complacency and neglect. Jones didn't attempt to detail the national debate over slavery that was current at that time. That limitation on his project was probably a good one. It allows us to see the human effects that rhetoric had covered, and allowed him to devote his attentions to demonstrating the range of positions that people could occupy in relation to the institution. Yes, whether you're descended from a slave, a master, a freed man, a black woman passing as white, an unwilling overseer, a treacherous deputy, a conscientious drunk, or an immigrant Irishwoman sold into prostitution, there's something in this book for you - and I wish that I was only joking, but the irony is that there is no irony here, and sincerity is the least of what we have to do, and memory is only the start of making a history that hasn't stopped."

        "text":"Set in antebellum Virginia, a former slave, Henry Townsend, owns fifty acres of land and thirty-three slaves. As the story opens, Townsend is dying. The novel chronicles his life, the lives of his family members, and the lives of people he encountered in the community. The main characters are three-dimensional and feel like real people, with both admirable traits and flaws. Jones employs an omniscient narrator and non-linear storytelling. He weaves together overlapping stories of past and present events, such that the reader knows what happens to these people in the future before knowing what has happened to them in the book’s “present.” There are a great many characters in this book and the list of Dramatis Personae is helpful in keeping them all straight. This novel is based on a lesser known historical fact. While it was not common, it did happen that some free blacks owned slaves. It lends a complexity to the slavery narrative – showing how people can be impacted by society’s strictures and how victims of exploitation could become perpetrators of the same system. This is not a quick and easy read. It feels like being immersed in the life and times of Manchester County, Virginia, in the 1850s. It is an eloquently written condemnation of oppression in any form. This book won the Pulitzer Prize in 2004."

        "text":"2.5-stars, really. here is a perfect example of a books i should love, and yet.... i didn't. the book was a lot of work and, for me, very little reward. i think most of my issues are because of the style\/structure of the novel: * the third-person, omniscient narrator - this was distracting from very early on in the read. i held off judging it. i wanted to trust jones and his choice. * non-linear narrative - i don't tend to have problems with this at all, but i found it super-clunky here. also distracting. * the made-up references - jones would cite sources and details that seemed to lend such an air of gravitas, but none of it is actually real. (i know, i know. this is fiction. a novel. get over it. but it was just kinda weird to me. social commentary inserted into fiction happens. steinbeck did it. teju cole does it. many writers do this. i felt like jones did a crap-ton of research for this book. but then i read this NPR piece . in it, he notes he collected 2 shelves worth of books on slavery... \"but never got around to reading them\" . so this just added to my 'what the?' on the references in the novel and jones' research.) * all of this combined for a really awkward flow, and convoluted storytelling. i felt like it could lose 50-100 pages and be a tighter, better story. in case you think maybe i am a lazy reader - i'm not, i swear! i love nothing more than a meaty, tough read. jones' story is definitely both of these things. he explores the issue of free black people owning slaves in virginia, and he gives us a large cast of active characters. but it all felt so... surface-y. we get the actions and reactions, but we don't really get the motivations or emotions. jones is navigating a morally dodgy landscape, one i would have loved to have gone into more deeply. we are given the horrors and the heartbreaks, but it all felt so detached. and, you know, maybe that is totally on purpose. maybe, for some people, detachment is the only way through such a horrible time in history. jones has collected some serious critical acclaim and recognition over his career. to name a few: he's won the pulitzer, the national book critic's circle award, the PEN\/Hemingway award, a MacArthur genius grant, and the International IMPAC dublin literary award. he's won nearly $1 million in literary awards alone. the man knows what he's doing, and the respect he's earned is fairly universal. the known world is an important story. but is just shining the light on the issues jones raises enough? so now i am back to the should . i should love this book. (it was just okay for me.) people should read this book. (indeed. but this is not a book i will blanket recommend to all.) so, i don't know you guys. i am bummed over this one. and this is a terrible review\/collection of thoughts. maybe i'll become more coherent with some distance and fix this up a bit - but for now i wanted to note down something here. (aside #1 (going to be a bit spoiler-y here): moses confused me. or, rather, his turn to all-of-a-sudden being an asshole was weird. we're going along with moses. he seems like a lovely man. then, halfway into the book, he's a wife-beater, jerkface? where did that come from, and why was he presented like that? the reveal of moses being a not nice man was sudden and odd.) (aside #2: worth noting (was hugely interesting to me) - the cover photo of this edition is © Eudora Welty ! i had no idea about her photographic prowess .)"

        "text":"Here is a book about black slave owners in the antebellum South! My interest was immediately piqued. On top of that, the book has won all sorts of prizes: *Pulitzer Prize for Fiction (2004) *International Dublin Literary Award (2005) *Anisfield-Wolf Book Award (2004) *National Book Critics Circle Award for Fiction (2003) * Hurston\/Wright Legacy Award Nominee for Debut Fiction (\/2004 *National Book Award Finalist for Fiction (2003) I knew I had to give it a try. I am glad I have read it, but to say I like it, would just not be true. It’s OK, so I am giving it two stars. There is no real central character to the story, because he dies right off the bat. It is 1855 when Henry Townsend dies. He is black. He had been a slave, but his parents had bought him his freedom. He leaves behind no children but a wife, Caldonia, a twenty-eight-year-old educated black woman born free, and his property of thirty-three slaves and fifty acres in Manchester County, Virginia. The book is about the hell that breaks loose afterwards, but really what it is about is life in the South during the antebellum era, about the mindset of Blacks and Whites of this era. The story is told by an omniscient narrator—who knows how each character thinks, what has happened to all of them in the past and what will happen to all of them in the future. It is this all-seeing narrator that shapes the entire feel of the story. This narrator knows everything, but he is not particularly adept at cogently telling a story. In one sentence you may switch form the present to the future and back again. In the next sentence you flip back to the past. It is easy to become confused. Character upon character is thrown at you, with little tidbits about their lives in the past, present and future. You are given an entire community of individuals—Whites and Blacks, a Native American or two, those who are free and those who are slaves, a sheriff and his deputy. The omniscient narrator is constantly restating who each one is, which is good in one sense, but the flow of the tale becomes jerky. Stop and start, backward and forward and often confusing. Use of the omniscient narrator is pushed to the extreme. It is kind of nice to have a character or two to guide you through a story. You do not have that here. There are a whole group of characters, characters that are hard to attach yourself to. You do not get close to any one individual. In the afterword the author points out that he wanted to draw characters that were neither all good nor all bad, each one different in their own way. You do get that here, but you fail to feel anything for any of them. What you do get is a strong sense of being one of a large community. You are there, one among many, living in the antebellum South. This does give one a hands-on feeling of life then and there and how people were thinking. Kevin Free narrates the audiobook. It is simple to follow, the speed is fine and he intonations are well done. The narration performance is good so I have given the narration three stars."

        "text":"I attended a workshop with some friends during which we all went around the room and recommended books that really moved us that year. I don't remember which book I suggested then, but I recall one woman in particular who really loved this book (or I believe she was more in love with Edward Jones' writing). At the end of the workshop we had a gift exchange raffle and she included this book as her contribution. I was the lucky recipient of this free copy. I was interested in this historical novel set in a fictional place in Virginia during the antebellum era, about a former slave who ends up owning slaves. The strangeness of the story and the angle it takes as a slave narrative is intriguing. Also appealing is the way the omniscient narration allows the reader to approach the story without the moral judgement one reserves for this kind of story, since the distance of the narration allows one to realize quickly what the story tries to showcase: how slavery has already poisoned the integrity of all involved. The framework of the novel is composed of anecdotal stories within stories, with pacing often interrupted for a mini scene or two, or an introduction of yet another character who may reappear later or simply disappear. Put another way, it is a book of puzzle pieces: one is added, taken away, another picked up, oh yes, there's the whole, whoops, maybe not, here goes another piece. So although I admired the writing and story setup in the beginning, I just was not in the right space to complete this novel. It has been a while since I added a book to my \"did-not-finish\" list; alas, this one has just made the list. This is not a failed attempt at reading this novel, however, because I remember not being able to finish Ngugi wa Thiong'o's Wizard of the Crow only to later fall in love with his novel, Petals of Blood . With that in mind, I look forward to reading Jones' Lost in the City ."

While not exactly removing race from the issue of slavery, Jones is able to show that even among African-Americans the perniciousness of slavery could damn a generation. The best summary of this idea came from a NYTimes review: 'There are few certified villains in this novel, white or black, because slavery poisons moral judgments at the root. As Jones shows, slavery corrupts good intentions and underwrites bad ones, yet allows decency the odd occasion -- but only by creating such an enormous need for it.' The pacing and structure of this novel could be a little challenging to some, but I found that it fit the narrative perfectly. This isn't a novel that burns you with its quotable sentences, but it scars you with its images. There were periods in it where I thought I was reading a Cormac McCarthy novel. That alone is high praise."

        "text":"When Toni Morrison began her research for \"Beloved,\" she discovered a trove of ghastly instruments. She knew, of course, that slaves were routinely whipped, starved, raped, and hanged, but the existence of specially forged tools was a surprise: metal bits forced down the throat, iron masks locked across the face, spiked collars clasped around the neck. Her Pulitzer Prize-winning novel reintroduced those horrors into the national memory and did much to demonstrate that the cruelties of slavery extended far beyond hard labor and physical deprivation. \"The Known World,\" by Edward Jones, reclaims another peculiarity of American slavery and in the process illustrates yet again that we can't under- estimate its perverse contortions of the human spirit. Bizarre as it sounds, in Louisiana, Virginia, and South Carolina, a small number of free blacks owned their own plantations - and their own slaves. It was a precarious arrangement, to be sure. Blacks who were freed or managed to buy their own freedom had little incentive to tarry in the South. The laws governing their status and their right to hold property were ambiguous and easy for any white person to shred. Jones uses this fragile situation as the setting for a novel about a group of black and white Virginians who tried - sometimes nobly, often viciously - to maintain their world in the face of inevitable collapse. To the extent that Morrison spun a surreal tale of American slavery into mythic proportions, Jones has carved a companion series of stark anecdotes into national legends. In a measured voice that never rises to reflect the agonies and absurdities he describes, he moves back and forth through decades and across state lines, assembling an apparently random collection of brief scenes that gradually fuse into a stunning portrait of moral confusion. The story revolves around Henry Townsend, a black man who, with the indulgence of his former owner, managed to buy his own farm and his own slaves - eventually 29 adults and a collection of children. Henry's parents, who labored tirelessly to free him as a child, are horrified by his participation in the flesh market, but Henry is ambitious, and, what's more, he learned from his master that \"once you own even one, you will never be alone.\" As a protection against loneliness and a way to wealth, Henry can't imagine anything more successful, and he's convinced he can be \"a better master than any white man he had ever known.\" Indeed, he attains that dubious goal, creating a plantation with forced labor that's largely free of physical beatings, but it's an insidious gentility that only camouflages the humiliations of Southern slavery. Nevertheless, his untimely death frightens most of his slaves, who know just how delicate their relative comfort is. Only the brooding overseer, Moses, the first slave Henry ever bought, sees his master's demise as an opportunity - not for freedom, but for taking his place. Indeed, what interests Jones most in this complex novel is the way slavery distorts judgment, not just of those who oppress, but of those who are oppressed. Henry's widow, Caldonia, quickly decides against freeing \"her legacy,\" choosing instead to maintain the plantation in the spirit of Henry's gentle example. \"Her husband had done the best he could,\" she thinks, \"and on Judgment Day his slaves would stand before God and testify to that fact.\" Occasionally, a child is worked to death or a pregnant woman labors in the field till she miscarries, but Caldonia sheds sincere tears, comforts the parents, and considers whether she should buy insurance against further losses of her property. As a single woman with a large business to run, she's encouraged by a collection of family and friends, other free blacks, some of whom own their own slaves, too. One of the most troubling is Fern, Caldonia's prim teacher of literature and etiquette. Together, they keep the irony of their position well buried, while socializing in a kind of racial terrarium maintained by William Robbins, the county's wealthiest white farmer. Estranged from his own wife but protected by his political power, he loves a black woman in town and openly adores his two mulatto children. The Townsend plantation with its little coterie of free slave-owning blacks gives his favorites a place to play and refine themselves. In one of several shifts to the late 19th century, a Canadian historian interviews Fern, Caldonia's teacher, about those days on the plantation. \"All of us do only what the law and God tell us we can do,\" she says without any hint of guilt or remorse. \"We owned slaves. It was what was done, and so that is what we did.\" Jones uses that same tone of historical distance throughout, a tone that amplifies the grotesque mingling of affection and cruelty that infected these people, black and white. In the center of this moral kaleidoscope stands the sheriff, John Skiffington, an earnest Christian, dedicated to the objective application of law and convinced that \"the law always cares\" for everyone equally. It's a doomed endeavor, of course, but as Caldonia's plantation begins to collapse, Skiffington fails to realize that the legal system he's sworn to uphold is not objective and that he cannot remain clean within it. The scrambled collection of events and characters makes this a difficult story to enter, but that structure eventually accounts for much of the novel's evocative power. Jones has a kind of biblical style that suggests whole lives in a few stark details from a perspective that's alternately microscopic and telescopic. It's a technique that resists our efforts to keep these events in some unrecoverable past. The troubling implications of his story leach in through hairline cracks all over the twin shells of antebellum nostalgia and Northern piety. Every time Caldonia cheerfully reminds her friends, \"We are all worthy of one another,\" the legacy of slavery sounds more complex and unresolved. http:\/\/www.csmonitor.com\/2003\/0814\/p1..."

        "text":"Manchester County, Virginia doesn't exist. Never has. After reading The Known World, however, you'd be forgiven if you thought you could take a tour of it's plantations and slave cemetaries on your vacation to colonial Williamsburg. The complicated pre-civil war Southern society that Edward P. Jones creates feels as real and surreal as any factual history of slavery you've read. It was not so much the story of Henry Townsend, a black slave owner, and all the people that his death allows us to meet that engaged me. It was the world, a world where I could taste the soil I might till and the women I might marry and the terrible choices I might be faced with, that put it's claws in me and refused to let go. It took me nearly 2 months to finish the book's 388 pages. It should've been a quick read. It is a fascinating place with peculiar problems and characters I cried for on more than one occasion. It should've been a quick read but I kept asking myself this question: who would I have been? The slave, toiling away in the field? The overseer, unable to see the world for what it truly was? The freed man, working desperately to free the rest of his family? The smart child, taken under the wing of the rich white slave owner and convinced that there was nothing wrong with owning another human being? The broken black man tortured by his family's wealth built on the backs of men and women that look just like me? The slave too proud, too strong, too powerful to let another take his freedom? Who would I have been? Who am I now? In matters of race, there is always that fool's point, usually made by a white person (though not always) that asks,\"why aren't you over it, already? Can't we just let it go?\" It is a way to end an uncomfortable conversation. The reasons don't matter. I know many a person for which the sticky tar baby of race in America is simply a discussion they can't stick their hands in. It is too difficult. Too raw. Too cloudy to be sure that people will remain friends after an honest chat. The way I feel when I read books like The Known World is my answer. No matter how well-adjusted, how integrated, how loving of my fellow man, how multiculti kumbayah I am, I'm not over it. I can't let it go. This fictional world was very real not all that long ago. It's effects still ripple through our every day. The world I know doesn't exist without it. Highly highly recommended."

        "text":"there is that old adage that a good book will tell you how to read it. and i have no idea to whom that should be attributed, only that my undergrad professors seemed to have been born to quote that thought endlessly: in my gothic lit class, my enlightenment class, my victorian lit class... the african and irish lit professors mostly kept their mouths shut on the subject. but the rest - hoo boy - did they love to drag that old chestnut out... and it makes sense, to a certain degree. but this book doesn't tell you how to read it so much as it presents itself to the reader, like a fat man in a speedo lolling around on an undersized towel saying, \"look at me ladies, you like it?? this is what you get!!\" it almost demands that you read it and like it. but i was disobedient. every sentence, every paragraph, seemed to be trying to contain multitudes. and i am a fan of \"thick\" writing, but the manner in which this book presented itself quickly soured on me. there were too many stories or episodes ending with, \"years from now, when celia was on her deathbed, she would think back to her third year of marriage\",in a scene where she has yet to even be married, or right after two characters are introduced to each other, \"this would be the last time they would meet until the hailstorm of aught-six\" - and i am making up all the names and situations here, but you get an idea of the shape of my complaints. it's constant foreshadowing and some of the foreshadowing is just teasing, as the events never come to pass in the novel itself. it's like sitting down to tea with a god in his dotage, rambling and making connections only he can understand; seeing the past and future simultaneously. \"hey, karen, didn't you really like that kjaerstaad trilogy, where he basically did what you are complaining about here??\" yeah, what? so? shut up - isn't it past your bedtime?? yeah, but sure, that's true. but for some reason, it bothered me here. all i wanted was a straightforward linear narrative about a fascinating subject matter: free black men and women who owned slaves. when i read roll of thunder, hear my cry last summer, the whole transition period between slavery and freedom really excited my brainparts. i dunno. and mister jones was a real sweetheart when he came for the new yorker festival and i waited in line to get a book signed for a friend and i really wanted to like it because it seems like a nice fat sprawling sweeping story the way i like, but i just got lost in the names and the timeline and my confusion turned into apathy. it's like this guy you date who seems really perfect - he is smart and looks like gabriel byrne and he dotes on you and everything is fun and on paper it all looks great and you know you should really like him, but he just doesn't make you laugh so you run off and leave him for a rockstar. you know? because i feel like i should like this one because it is award-winning, and my experience with the african-american novel is middling (although i love the african novel, the west indian novel and the afro-canadian novel - go figure) so i feel like as someone who appreciates literature in general, i should totally love this. but it wasn't there for me. oh, chris wilson, i am sorry. now you are going to want full custody because your baby is being raised among heathens. years from now, when my and chris wilson's book-baby became the mayor of littleton, he would read this review and a tear of sorrow would come to his eye at my short-sightedness. come to my blog!"

        "text":"I know this is a critically acclaimed book, a Pulitzer winner, and a book tackling a difficult and complex stain on America history: slavery and black slave owners. There are moments when the book does say some interesting things or reveal some unsavory and uncomfortable truths, but it was so hard to engage with as a reader. I mean, I hung in with DFW through the first 600 pages of Infinite Jest where nothing happens -- but because I was fascinated by Hal, Orin, Marathe, Steeply, and Mario and Madame Psychosis who all fascinated me. There were literally dozens of other characters but these all pulled me in. In The Known World, there are also dozens of characters but none that I grew any attachment too. It was as if the author Jones was using a hand-held camera and no stabilizer so that the images were jumpy and out of focus. It reminded me sometimes of how the world seems to my myopic eyes between taking off my glasses in the morning and putting in my contact lenses. The narration also highly annoyed me. All the parenthetical \"in 60 years so and so will do such as such\" were meaningless because I was given neither enough time nor enough detail to give a shit. Further, there is this reference to \"years later they would all turn into human torches in front of the dry foods store\", but no mention afterwards of to what this referred. But the most annoying bit was in using the Canadian journalist frame at about page 130 or so (which then only briefly appears in the narrative 200 pages later in a parenthetical throwaway comment, it is said that the journalist would never marry his heart's desire yet 3 pages later, they marry and that coming to talk to Fern that there was some incomprehensible stuff that happens off-screen that morning (also never adequately explained) and so she was not going to open up to the journalist and yet we still find her filling in details about Henry, Moses and Caledonia 30 pages later. Too much inconsistency - was the editor asleep or stoned and missed these? So, despite taking on a complex subject, Jones is no Faulkner as his South does not eve approach that of the Great William. He is not as good as Pynchon or DFW is manipulating time and space in a narrative that was 100 or 150 pages too long and felt it, and he is not Alice Walker or Toni Morrison who brought us the most amazing, poignant, and powerful images of slavery and its residual impacts generations later that I have ever read. So, read Beloved or Absalom, Absalom if you want to hear about the South and I expect you will be less frustrated, but every bit enraged at this deplorable institution that is a cancer on the American past."

        "text":"Ambitious, Interesting, Disorganized In an interview, Edward P. Jones revealed that The Known World took shape around 1) when he heard that Black people had owned slaves and 2) when he read a thin paperback in high school about a Jewish man who decided to join the Nazi party, how he acted in opposition to how one would expect. The Known World is an ambitious novel which aims to describe the world of 1855 where Henry Townsend has recently died. As a result of his death, a cloud of uncertainty hangs in the air as he leaves behind his widow, Caldonia, and the undetermined fate of the slaves he purchased to work his land. Although the plot is interesting, this book is disorganized. It covers many different characters and rapidly shifts time periods. I would be reading along and then the text would say “and this person lived to be 93 years old and had 235 grandchildren.” (paraphrasing) Countless times, I had to stop and reread because the storytelling was so clunky. In The Known World, there are quite a few references to Adam and Eve, even references to Milton (Paradise Lost). My favorite author, Philip Pullman, loves to talk about this topic and how in his works he wanted his characters to find their way back to The Garden by taking the long way around. So this quote on page 329 stood out: “There was a long way around but he chose not to take it.” There is a character in The Known World by the name of Anderson Frazier. He creates and distributes pamphlets and interviews Fern Elston. In my opinion, this pamphlet could have provided a framework to systematically organize the characters instead of the resulting jumbled and confusing soup of characters and timelines. The Known World has some unforgettable moments, but the organization of the narrative reduces the enjoyment of the reading experience.

        "text":"This is a complex novel, with dense writing, a non-linear structure, and an abundance of characters. It reads much like a true historical account of a place, Manchester County, Virginia, and time, pre-Civil War 1800s. This could very nearly have passed for a non-fiction book; each character feels so real, their personal stories and histories so authentic. The author even goes so far as to tell us what happens to many of them ten, twenty or even fifty years in the future. And yet, Edward P. Jones himself states: \"The county and town of Manchester, Virginia, and every human being in those places, are products of my imagination… The census records I made up for Manchester were, again, simply to make the reader feel that the town and the county and the people lived and breathed in central Virginia once upon a time…\" Well, consider me duped. At first I really thought such a county existed and the data presented were genuine facts. As my son passed through the living room, I even shouted out some sort of statistic or another and asked if he had ever read about such a thing in his history classes. He couldn’t recall, but it sounded ‘familiar’. Right, because much of this could have been true, yet it wasn’t. The institution of slavery of course was all too real and cruel, and that’s what this book is about, and this is the truth. Slavery in all its forms is evil. Henry Townsend is a black farmer. He is a former slave that with the purchase of freedom and some land becomes a slave owner himself. Henry and his wife Caldonia own a small plantation near the border of his former master’s much larger one. I could not wrap my head around why on earth a freed man would ever want to enslave another human being. Henry and other black slave owners like him justify their actions: \"Henry had always said that he wanted to be a better master than any white man he had ever known. He did not understand that the kind of world he wanted to create was doomed before he had even spoken the first syllable of the word master.\" Well, as the old saying goes, ‘the road to hell is paved with good intentions.’ When Henry dies, all hell breaks loose, and we begin to see the ill-fated consequences of an institution that is immoral and corrupt. A narrative that seems to jump around in time and between characters eventually comes together into a whole as consequences and events snowball out of control. Lives are permanently changed. Some for the worst, others (we hope) for the better. They all become woven together much like the massive tapestry hanging on the wall of another place in another time. Each is part of the story. Everyone is responsible for the events which passed, were allowed to pass despite the huge injustice to humanity. This book is not easy to read. The structure is challenging and the topic is gloomy, albeit important. What happens to the people we grow to care for is often horrifying and heartbreaking. But it is well-written and extremely impactful. An important novel which is well worth your time and attention if you are up for the challenge. It won't suit everyone, but if you are at all interested, I encourage you to pick this one up. \"What I feared most at that moment is what I still fear: that they would remember my history, that I, no matter what I had always said to the contrary, owned people of our Race.\""

        "text":"Dear The Known World : I'll be blunt. I'm breaking things off. This just isn't working. It's not you; it's me. Well, maybe it's you, too, a bit. I really thought when we got together that we would have a brief but mutually satisfying relationship. I'd read you, you'd provide enlightenment or emotional catharsis or entertainment, maybe even all three. All the signs were there: the laudatory quotes on your jacket, a shocking and unexpected premise, high marks on goodreads. But something was just off by the end of the first chapter. Maybe it was the masturbation scene right at the start. Or the characters that I just couldn't get into - I could hardly tell some of them apart. Or the way the narrative seemed to skip all over without any focus. Maybe I just didn't give you enough pages. I'm sure you got better as you went along. I mean, look at all the four- and five-star reviews you've gotten! But every time I picked you up my thoughts turned to the three other books on my bedside table that I'd rather be reading. I haven't actually been unfaithful, but that's just not a healthy basis for a relationship. So after 72 pages, I'm putting you down. Don't feel too bad. Focus on all those other, good reviews and maybe we'll meet again someday when the stars all align just right. But probably not.

        "text":"There’s irony that I read more than half of this wrenching, ugly, hopeful, stirring, and grievous book while holding a sleeping baby in my arms. Because there is a lot of life and death in this take on pre-Civil War Virginia. I knew little about the book except that the author wrote it after reading about freed Black folks owning slaves. In delving into this issue, which in any modern conversation circle must bring dissonance, disbelief, and maybe even disgust, I became increasingly moved and disturbed. A difficult book, both because it’s an unflinching look at slavery, but also because it’s written in a James Joyce-ish style — lots of asides and stream of consciousness text. The author careens from generation to generation and back again in often the same paragraph. Yet it worked for me. It reads like a memoir of an entire county’s 150-year history complete with dozens of families represented. What results is simply, UNFORGETTABLE. There are characters whose faces I imagined while reading and characters whose stories I became invested in that will haunt me. Not in the truth of a fictional characterization but more because the ugliness of humanity was so blatantly on display and sadly remains real to this day. As I bid farewell to the slaves, slaveowners, children of both and ministers, sheriffs and patrollers of this novel, I will not forget their names. And I can’t help but wonder who would I have been in Manchester County, Virginia? (Reviewed 2\/12\/25)"

        "text":"I'm going to have to rave a bit, because this is one of the best books I've read in the past ten years. Jones packs in all the historical detail you could want, and of course he's hit on a subject--black slaveowners--that in and of itself is tabloid-sensational. Where lesser writers might lean too hard on the sensational aspect (or rely on it to bolster an otherwise weak narrative), Jones works it into a compelling and powerful story. What makes it so powerful is a mix of fascinating characters who are woven into a series of overlapping plotlines. For me it's the structuring that is so brilliant (geek alert: I actually diagrammed the time shifts in the chapters as an exercise, to see when and how Jones yoked the whole thing together). This less than linear approach might be frustrating to those who just want things to be straightforward, but stick with it: the shifts provide suspense as well as texture, and they propel more than one storyline at once. They do all come together, trust me. I also admire the overarching authorial voice in the novel, which certainly leans toward the formal, but also comes across as aware of the history it's grappling with: here and there Jones projects his voice forward for a moment, or seemingly digresses with factual material and research. Again it's all part of the tapestry and the mix, and I also think that the level of narrative awareness (which never disengages long enough to derail anything) adds another layer to the very idea of history--making the whole historical and contemporary both. And for those of you who can do without all of the above writerly blather (a thousand pardons), you'll find in this book characters who are engaging, ignorant, cruel, earnest, sympathetic, tragic, hopeful, flawed--in short, complicated. Halfway through you'll be fighting off the impulse to skip ahead to learn everyone's fate. Finally, I'll say that this book isn't perfect--there are aspects of what I've described above that sometimes don't work: narrative turns that do seem pointless digressions, a character or two a bit stereotypical or annoying. No matter. This book aims high, as brilliant works of art do, and the result is nothing short of amazing."

        "text":"This book demands that you read it slowly and intently. Like eating a huge Thanksgiving dinner, you need to pause and digest before you have the next course. At the outset, the plot seems to be all over the place, bouncing from character to character, telling too many stories, not telling enough and then seeming to tell too much. Ah, but then, you make a little progress and the rhythm begins to assert itself, the stories begin to weave together, the minute details begin to become a diorama, the picture stops being a blur and comes into sharp focus. This isn’t one man’s story, or even the story of one place, this is the story of all men and this is the tale of a world. This book is not so much about race as it is about the abject insanity and evil of the institution of slavery, wherever it is found, whoever is practicing it. In this system, there are free black masters holding black slaves, some of them well-meaning, but it does not make the practice any less immoral. There are white men who love their black mistresses and the children they bear, but it does not remove the fact that they hold a dominion over them that is not borne of love in any of its guises. There are also individuals who are victims of the system and others who refuse to be victims of the system, even at the cost of their lives. I loved many of Jones’ characters, notably Augustus and Mildred Townsend. They exemplify what is the best in us. I felt sorry for some of them, like Sheriff John Skiffington, who would like to be better than this society allows him to be, and Caldonia Townsend’s brother, Calvin, who wishes to go to New York so that he will not have to bear witness to the cruelties around him, cruelties he must realized have escaped him only because of a trick of fortune. I despised some of them, and I recognized most of them. The petty and jealous, who must have dominion over someone to feel they have worth; the ungrateful and traitorous, who would turn upon a friend to put some silver in their own pockets; the meek and hopeless, who bow to the yoke and try simply to find a corner in which they are allowed to exist; the defiant and strong-minded, who fight with their last breath because to do otherwise is to prop up the indefensible; all are here. What I loved most about this novel is its genuineness, its lack of exaggeration or hyperbole, where surely none is needed, its emphasis on the day-to-day injustice of an institution that is accepted as insurmountable or even correct only because it is what is. Edward P. Jones has leveled an attack at the heart of mankind and defied one to imagine what they would have done, what they would have dared to do, in such a place and time."

        "text":"A very complex and beautiful, compelling book about Henry, a former slave who becomes a slave owner, & his wife Caldonia. But they're just the start - the book is really a series of stories & vignettes about the families, friends, neighbors & community surrounding Henry & Caldonia. It took me a really long time to get into the book, because there are so many characters, some important & some not, & the book jumps around in time, making it difficult to follow. Trust me, use the cast of characters at the end of this edition (why not place this at the beginning?!) & give up your expectations about traditional narrative format, & you'll LOVE this book as much as I did. In life, we have our own story kind of playing in our head, & at the same time we have all these other stories we're hearing - the story about your mother's great-uncle. The story about your brother in law's neighbor. The one about your sister's husband's aunt & her neighbor. the one about your coworker's mother. You know all those stories? That's what this book is like - some characters are more important than others, so you hear more of their stories, but minor characters have stories too, & they sort of appear out of nowhere, & you get to hear their story, & then they're gone. It's really very cool! I particularly loved the story of the womanizing slave who has a vision during a lightning storm\/tornado - & becomes the founder of an orphanage. And the little tiny story about the family who don't want to give up their cow, & the woman goes into the barn to milk the cow & there's this lovely description of her squirting the cow's milk into a cat's mouth, & if you've ever seen a cat eat with true contentment you will recognize the cat body language that Jones describes. Toward the end of the book there's a very powerful scene where a character, who isn't a particularly \"good\" character, says there should be a lantern or light of truth in the world, an actual place where people can stand & tell the truth without fear of retribution, where one might be able to right a wrong. It's a moment where you think, yes this guy could right the wrong by speaking out, because his fear of having people think he's \"on the negro's side\" is...well, wrong! But that's his fear & in that moment of the book you understand it & you think, yeah, what if he could speak out under that light of truth & not have anyone judge him? How wonderful would that be? While the book depicts the horrors of slavery, & there are a few characters who are outright despicable, there are many shades of gray in Jones' vision as well. It's a book that will make you think about slavery, the myths & realities & tragedies of it all, & on top of that it'll make you think about your own life & all the people you've known & how complex & interesting we all are, really. It's beautifully written & the characters will stick in your head as if you'd known them too. Oddly, I think what I initially disliked most about this book - its multitude of characters & convoluted timeline - is what I ended up really enjoying! Another example of a book that made my head expand, with some creakiness, but I'm glad the expansion can still happen!"

        "text":"In this book I learned that there used to be black slaveholders in the US. I thought that only white people were allowed to own slaves during the time that owning slaves were like owning properties. During that pre-Abolition time. During those sad dark days in the American history. Black Edward P. Jones (born 1951) wrote this historical epic novel, The Known World based on the not well known fact that there were some black slaveholders (black people owning black slaves) in the state of Virginia during the time in the US when owning slave is legal. Wikipedia has this to say: \"Slavery in the United States was a form of unfree labor which existed as a legal institution in North America for more than a century before the founding of the United States in 1776, and continued mostly in the South until the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution in 1865.[1] The first English colony in North America, Virginia, first imported Africans in 1619, a practice earlier established in the Spanish colonies as early as the 1560s.[2] Most slaves were black and were held by whites, although some Native Americans and free blacks also held slaves; there were a small number of white slaves as well.[3]\" Winner of the 2004 Pulitzer Award for Fiction, The Known World is one of the most memorable reads I had this year. It is not an easy book to read. This 388-page novel left me with a heavy chest each time I closed the book. Each page is gloomy and sad. The novel is well-told with lyrical prose creating a big canvas of imagery in one's mind while reading. In that big canvas are memorable and three-dimensional numerous characters most of them black slaves. No character is downright bad or good. The detailed description of the sceneries of a fictional county called Manchester and the true depictions of the characters are exceptionally striking that I had to slow down in my reading to savor the story and hold on *tugging to them, cheering them on* to each characters. Reading the last page left me with a heavy heart. I would not want to let go of that image of Manchester and say goodbye Please don't go yet to the characters that I already became part of my literary world. The world that resides in the recesses of my brain. The world that is known only to me populated by people who I met only in my readings. In terms of writing, Jones extensively use the technique called prolepsis that I first encountered reading Muriel Sparks' The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie (1961). Jones explained this in the interview (appendix of the book) saying that he is the God of those characters so he knows what happened in the life of each characters from the time he\/she was born up to the time his\/her death. The most moving example of this use was with the character of the child Tessie . One fine day of September 1855, their mistress Caldonia saw the 5-y\/o Tessie playing with a wooden toy horse. Caldonia says to the child: That is very nice, Tessie to which Tessie responded, My papa did this for me . In January 2002, on her deathbed, the old Tessie asked her caretaker to get the wooden toy horse from the attic. While holding the toy, she breathed her last saying the same thing: My papa did this for me . My heart stopped beating. Tears welled up in my eyes. That scene is just one of the many moving scenes about those slaves in that time of the history in Virginia when black people were traded like they were not human but properties. I can make this review very long. There are just too many good things I would like to say here but I am afraid that no review can make justice to a book as good as this."

        "text":"Jar Of Death Pick #28 3.5 Stars Most people probably believe that the only people who owned slaves were white people. But that's actually not the truth. Free blacks owned other black people. Some free blacks bought their family members and others just wanted the slave labor. Native Americans owned slaves for much of the same reasons. The Known World introduces us to some of those people. The Known World has won a whole gang of awards, so we know its an important book and the writing is top notch. My only problems with the book were the fact that there were too many characters. You know this is a pet peeve of mine and I lost track of all the characters in this book. My other problem was that it jumped backwards and forwards in time way too much. Most of the time jumps were super confusing. I liked The Known World but I think I might not be smart enough to read this book. I'll probably reread it sometime in the future and I do recommend to others because its a brilliant book."

However, any plot that might exist was buried so deep beneath the convoluted chronology and extraneous characters and details that I decided I didn't care to keep digging for it, and quit on page 198. The author seemed determined to insert every existing anecdote about slavery into one novel. This might have worked better as a compilation of essays or short stories."

The author kept on jumping around the timeline too much - and honestly - I would describe this book as a glimpse of the lives of slaves in the south, but with a blah storyline. However this book has won a pultizer prize. EH!? Anyone out there who has read this book? Your opinions?? However like always, we learn from books. What I got out of this book was a new knowledge I never came upon, that black people owned black slaves.They even buy their own family members, and the slaves were considered as properties, including family. Hmm... History is richier than we will ever know or think of."

        "text":"The Known World does this weird thing: it cites its sources. And it's weird because they don't exist. There are passages like this: [Manchester, VA] went through a period of years and years of what University of Virginia historian Roberta Murphy in a 1948 book would call 'peace and prosperity'. Jones goes on to tell you the publication history of that book, and a few more things about what was in it, and to imply that Roberta Murphy was a little racist. But there is no Roberta Murphy, there is no book, there is no Manchester, VA. What is Jones up to? Wyatt Mason notes : What research on the subject Jones undertook was, in fact, quickly derailed after he happened upon an account of a white slave owner who spent her days abusing one of her black slaves, a little girl, by beating her head against a wall. “If I had wanted to tell the whole story of slavery, Americans couldn’t have taken that,” Jones told an interviewer. “People want to think that there was slavery, and then we got beyond it. People don’t want to hear that a woman would take a child and bang her head against the wall day after day. It’s nice that I didn’t read all those books. What I would have had to put down is far, far harsher and bleaker. Too much of a bummer? It's not that The Known World is a feel-good novel. Ears and Achilles tendons will be sliced. It follows the rules of slavery books: slave narratives always had happy endings; later, fictional slave narratives always have sad endings. But Toni Morrison has a different opinion about what Americans can and can't take. Shit, so does Harriet Jacobs. And Jones knows this, so he's being disingenuous. And you notice that he's talking about books he didn't actually read. NPR says, Jones collected two shelves of books about slavery, but never got around to reading them. Still, the author was able to use his imagination, and stories he had heard growing up, to make his characters come alive. \"I decided the people I'd created were real enough and I had just accumulated enough information about what the world was like in the South before 1865 to allow me to lie and get away with it,\" he says. Look, I don't mean to say Jones isn't telling the truth. I don't know if he is, and neither does he; neither of us read those two shelves of books about slavery. But the citation of imaginary sources in the book itself serves to either add authenticity that's undeserved, or - if you follow up on those sources - underline its lack of authenticity. I'm puzzled by it. This sort of meta-sourcing has been done before - by Nabokov in Pale Fire, by Cervantes, and in its closest parallel by Borges in his first collection, Universal History of Iniquity, which also confused me. It's especially jarring here, maybe just because I find the truth of slavery a fraught subject, and maybe because the layers go so deep - even in interviews about his lack of authenticity, he appears to be consciously inauthentic. I don't know, man, I don't get it. But anyway: is it a good made-up story about made-up people? Yeah, sure, totally. Eventually. The first half is a little annoying. There's a lot of chronological foofarah - skipping all over the place for no pressing reason - and a ginormous cast it's hard to keep track of, and our super-omniscient narrator often takes time out to tell you some trivial character's entire life story, which you didn't really need. But the second half ratchets up the tension to pure shit-your-pantsville, as that sprawling cast all meet their assorted fates. It makes up for some irritation in the first half. So yeah, as a novel it's excellent. The authenticity issue, I bring up mostly because we take this book seriously; it won a Pulitzer. It deserves to be looked carefully at. I looked carefully and I was confused by its truth."

        "text":"Despite some luminous moments where the characters come alive in a special way, this novel about the lives of slaves in a fictional community in Virginia of the 1830s felt too hermetic and sealed off for me to enjoy it as thoroughly as others might. The special hook that the story holds is its rendering of freed blacks who became slave owners themselves. The focus is on one such plantation with about 30 slaves which is struggling to adapt to the death of its black master, Henry Townsend. We get a plausible history along the way of how his father, Augustus, was so talented at furniture making that he bought his own freedom, and state legislative action allowed him to continue residing in the state and eventually bought the freedom of his son. With other free blacks, such as the feisty, condescending teacher Fern, who came from the North, they form a small society of their own. While Augustus abhors slavery, his son tries to emulate the path taken by the whites to economic success by owning slaves. Despite an ambition to become a benevolent master, the corrupting influence of owning people as property is well portrayed. When his lonely widow takes up a love relationship with her plantation foreman, she is replicating the same abuse of power enacted by most other white plantation owners, and the consequences are tragic. The “known world” of plantation life in this fictional county is like an island in time, and the characters themselves seem stuck in it like insects in amber. The omniscient narrator is god-like in passing into the thoughts and dreams of more than a dozen characters. Unfortunately, the reader gets distanced from emotionally connecting to them by the narrator breaking the flow to leap backward and forward in time to reveal some particular fact or person’s fate (for more see: D.D. Wood review ). Ultimately, the human bonds holding people to each other came off as tenuous and unreal as beholding a ship in a bottle. Unlike the romanticized lives portrayed in Hailey’s “Roots”, the characters have no sense of cultural history of their African origins (the word itself appears nowhere in the book), and there is no foreshadowing of plantation life as a doomed phase in history on the path to the Civil War. The idea of a slave revolt is unthinkable, and the one humane white character, Sheriff Skiffington, feels no compunction over diligently carrying out a big part of his job in organizing night patrols and retrieval efforts when “property” runs away. Though we get no sense of the reality of the “Underground Railroad”, we do get a brilliant vision at one point where Augustus ends up mailing a slave girl to Philadelphia in a crate along with a shipment of his hand-carved walking sticks. In an interview with Jones appended to the audiobook version of the novel, he admits he did not do much research for the book and was not concerned about communicating any particular message to his readers about the history of slavery. As the creator of all the characters, he would not admit to favoring any one character over another. Still the reader can’t help but getting the message of how inhumane slavery was and how individuals trapped in it strived to achieve some form of dignity in their lives. Like other reviewers, I didn’t feel I got to know any of the characters well enough to get emotionally engaged with them. When not interrupted by invasions from the narrator, the prose is effective in evoking the place and time, an obvious factor in helping it gain a Pulitzer Prize. Here is a lovely example from the opening for the book: The evening his master dies he worked again well after he ended the day for the other adults, his own wife among them, and sent them back with hunger and tiredness to their cabins. The young ones, his son among them, had been sent out of the fields an hour or so before the adults, to prepare the late supper and, if there was time enough, to play in a few minutes of sun that were left. When he, Moses, finally freed himself of the ancient and brittle harness that connected him to the oldest mule his master owned, all that was left of the sun was a five-inch long memory of red orange laid out in still waves across the horizon between two mountains on the left and one on the right. He had been in the fields for all of fourteen hours. He paused before leaving the fields as the evening quiet wrapped itself about him. The mule quivered, wanting home and rest. Moses closed his eyes and bent down and took a pinch of the soil and ate it with no more thought than if it were a spot of cornbread. …he ate it not only to discover the strengths and weaknesses of the field, but because eating it tied him to the only thing in his small world that meant almost as much as his own life."

        "text":"Glorious account that gets past cliches. The premise is that two slaves in 1840s Virginia bought their freedom, but their son stayed a little too long under the master's care. What does the family do when the son starts his own farm and buys his own slaves? The mastery of Jones' writing comes in the sense of history that he lends to minute objects, chance encounters, and incantatory reveries within a frought landscape. Not content to write an unwritten history of forgotten people, Jones re-writes the histories that have been written, citing documents the purport to explain the historical phenomenon of free blacks who owned slaves. Passages that carry runaway characters to the north also tie in academic treatises from the next century, deeds and warrants and court decisions that attempted to justify white supremacy, and the momentoes that emancipated children carry to their deathbeds. Jones doesn't neglect to include tales of individual transformation, collective redemption, or international implications in this epic. Characters may come and go like fleeting ghosts, yet the marks they leave may remain. When the words of the plantation master and deeds of the escaped overseer have faded into ineffectual memory, we readers are left with both the sense that an institution has gone horribly wrong and that the people within it can be honorably right; even if the results remain unapparent, the promise of future change remains, along with the threat of complacency and neglect. Jones didn't attempt to detail the national debate over slavery that was current at that time. That limitation on his project was probably a good one. It allows us to see the human effects that rhetoric had covered, and allowed him to devote his attentions to demonstrating the range of positions that people could occupy in relation to the institution. Yes, whether you're descended from a slave, a master, a freed man, a black woman passing as white, an unwilling overseer, a treacherous deputy, a conscientious drunk, or an immigrant Irishwoman sold into prostitution, there's something in this book for you - and I wish that I was only joking, but the irony is that there is no irony here, and sincerity is the least of what we have to do, and memory is only the start of making a history that hasn't stopped."

        "text":"Set in antebellum Virginia, a former slave, Henry Townsend, owns fifty acres of land and thirty-three slaves. As the story opens, Townsend is dying. The novel chronicles his life, the lives of his family members, and the lives of people he encountered in the community. The main characters are three-dimensional and feel like real people, with both admirable traits and flaws. Jones employs an omniscient narrator and non-linear storytelling. He weaves together overlapping stories of past and present events, such that the reader knows what happens to these people in the future before knowing what has happened to them in the book’s “present.” There are a great many characters in this book and the list of Dramatis Personae is helpful in keeping them all straight. This novel is based on a lesser known historical fact. While it was not common, it did happen that some free blacks owned slaves. It lends a complexity to the slavery narrative – showing how people can be impacted by society’s strictures and how victims of exploitation could become perpetrators of the same system. This is not a quick and easy read. It feels like being immersed in the life and times of Manchester County, Virginia, in the 1850s. It is an eloquently written condemnation of oppression in any form. This book won the Pulitzer Prize in 2004."

        "text":"2.5-stars, really. here is a perfect example of a books i should love, and yet.... i didn't. the book was a lot of work and, for me, very little reward. i think most of my issues are because of the style\/structure of the novel: * the third-person, omniscient narrator - this was distracting from very early on in the read. i held off judging it. i wanted to trust jones and his choice. * non-linear narrative - i don't tend to have problems with this at all, but i found it super-clunky here. also distracting. * the made-up references - jones would cite sources and details that seemed to lend such an air of gravitas, but none of it is actually real. (i know, i know. this is fiction. a novel. get over it. but it was just kinda weird to me. social commentary inserted into fiction happens. steinbeck did it. teju cole does it. many writers do this. i felt like jones did a crap-ton of research for this book. but then i read this NPR piece . in it, he notes he collected 2 shelves worth of books on slavery... \"but never got around to reading them\" . so this just added to my 'what the?' on the references in the novel and jones' research.) * all of this combined for a really awkward flow, and convoluted storytelling. i felt like it could lose 50-100 pages and be a tighter, better story. in case you think maybe i am a lazy reader - i'm not, i swear! i love nothing more than a meaty, tough read. jones' story is definitely both of these things. he explores the issue of free black people owning slaves in virginia, and he gives us a large cast of active characters. but it all felt so... surface-y. we get the actions and reactions, but we don't really get the motivations or emotions. jones is navigating a morally dodgy landscape, one i would have loved to have gone into more deeply. we are given the horrors and the heartbreaks, but it all felt so detached. and, you know, maybe that is totally on purpose. maybe, for some people, detachment is the only way through such a horrible time in history. jones has collected some serious critical acclaim and recognition over his career. to name a few: he's won the pulitzer, the national book critic's circle award, the PEN\/Hemingway award, a MacArthur genius grant, and the International IMPAC dublin literary award. he's won nearly $1 million in literary awards alone. the man knows what he's doing, and the respect he's earned is fairly universal. the known world is an important story. but is just shining the light on the issues jones raises enough? so now i am back to the should . i should love this book. (it was just okay for me.) people should read this book. (indeed. but this is not a book i will blanket recommend to all.) so, i don't know you guys. i am bummed over this one. and this is a terrible review\/collection of thoughts. maybe i'll become more coherent with some distance and fix this up a bit - but for now i wanted to note down something here. (aside #1 (going to be a bit spoiler-y here): moses confused me. or, rather, his turn to all-of-a-sudden being an asshole was weird. we're going along with moses. he seems like a lovely man. then, halfway into the book, he's a wife-beater, jerkface? where did that come from, and why was he presented like that? the reveal of moses being a not nice man was sudden and odd.) (aside #2: worth noting (was hugely interesting to me) - the cover photo of this edition is © Eudora Welty ! i had no idea about her photographic prowess .)"

On top of that, the book has won all sorts of prizes: *Pulitzer Prize for Fiction (2004) *International Dublin Literary Award (2005) *Anisfield-Wolf Book Award (2004) *National Book Critics Circle Award for Fiction (2003) * Hurston\/Wright Legacy Award Nominee for Debut Fiction (\/2004 *National Book Award Finalist for Fiction (2003) I knew I had to give it a try. I am glad I have read it, but to say I like it, would just not be true. It’s OK, so I am giving it two stars. There is no real central character to the story, because he dies right off the bat. It is 1855 when Henry Townsend dies. He is black. He had been a slave, but his parents had bought him his freedom. He leaves behind no children but a wife, Caldonia, a twenty-eight-year-old educated black woman born free, and his property of thirty-three slaves and fifty acres in Manchester County, Virginia. The book is about the hell that breaks loose afterwards, but really what it is about is life in the South during the antebellum era, about the mindset of Blacks and Whites of this era. The story is told by an omniscient narrator—who knows how each character thinks, what has happened to all of them in the past and what will happen to all of them in the future. It is this all-seeing narrator that shapes the entire feel of the story. This narrator knows everything, but he is not particularly adept at cogently telling a story. In one sentence you may switch form the present to the future and back again. In the next sentence you flip back to the past. It is easy to become confused. Character upon character is thrown at you, with little tidbits about their lives in the past, present and future. You are given an entire community of individuals—Whites and Blacks, a Native American or two, those who are free and those who are slaves, a sheriff and his deputy. The omniscient narrator is constantly restating who each one is, which is good in one sense, but the flow of the tale becomes jerky. Stop and start, backward and forward and often confusing. Use of the omniscient narrator is pushed to the extreme. It is kind of nice to have a character or two to guide you through a story. You do not have that here. There are a whole group of characters, characters that are hard to attach yourself to. You do not get close to any one individual. In the afterword the author points out that he wanted to draw characters that were neither all good nor all bad, each one different in their own way. You do get that here, but you fail to feel anything for any of them. What you do get is a strong sense of being one of a large community. You are there, one among many, living in the antebellum South. This does give one a hands-on feeling of life then and there and how people were thinking. Kevin Free narrates the audiobook. It is simple to follow, the speed is fine and he intonations are well done. The narration performance is good so I have given the narration three stars."

        "text":"I attended a workshop with some friends during which we all went around the room and recommended books that really moved us that year. I don't remember which book I suggested then, but I recall one woman in particular who really loved this book (or I believe she was more in love with Edward Jones' writing). At the end of the workshop we had a gift exchange raffle and she included this book as her contribution. I was the lucky recipient of this free copy. I was interested in this historical novel set in a fictional place in Virginia during the antebellum era, about a former slave who ends up owning slaves. The strangeness of the story and the angle it takes as a slave narrative is intriguing. Also appealing is the way the omniscient narration allows the reader to approach the story without the moral judgement one reserves for this kind of story, since the distance of the narration allows one to realize quickly what the story tries to showcase: how slavery has already poisoned the integrity of all involved. The framework of the novel is composed of anecdotal stories within stories, with pacing often interrupted for a mini scene or two, or an introduction of yet another character who may reappear later or simply disappear. Put another way, it is a book of puzzle pieces: one is added, taken away, another picked up, oh yes, there's the whole, whoops, maybe not, here goes another piece. So although I admired the writing and story setup in the beginning, I just was not in the right space to complete this novel. It has been a while since I added a book to my \"did-not-finish\" list; alas, this one has just made the list. This is not a failed attempt at reading this novel, however, because I remember not being able to finish Ngugi wa Thiong'o's Wizard of the Crow only to later fall in love with his novel, Petals of Blood .

While not exactly removing race from the issue of slavery, Jones is able to show that even among African-Americans the perniciousness of slavery could damn a generation. The best summary of this idea came from a NYTimes review: 'There are few certified villains in this novel, white or black, because slavery poisons moral judgments at the root. As Jones shows, slavery corrupts good intentions and underwrites bad ones, yet allows decency the odd occasion -- but only by creating such an enormous need for it.' The pacing and structure of this novel could be a little challenging to some, but I found that it fit the narrative perfectly. This isn't a novel that burns you with its quotable sentences, but it scars you with its images. There were periods in it where I thought I was reading a Cormac McCarthy novel. That alone is high praise."

        "text":"When Toni Morrison began her research for \"Beloved,\" she discovered a trove of ghastly instruments. She knew, of course, that slaves were routinely whipped, starved, raped, and hanged, but the existence of specially forged tools was a surprise: metal bits forced down the throat, iron masks locked across the face, spiked collars clasped around the neck. Her Pulitzer Prize-winning novel reintroduced those horrors into the national memory and did much to demonstrate that the cruelties of slavery extended far beyond hard labor and physical deprivation. \"The Known World,\" by Edward Jones, reclaims another peculiarity of American slavery and in the process illustrates yet again that we can't under- estimate its perverse contortions of the human spirit. Bizarre as it sounds, in Louisiana, Virginia, and South Carolina, a small number of free blacks owned their own plantations - and their own slaves. It was a precarious arrangement, to be sure. Blacks who were freed or managed to buy their own freedom had little incentive to tarry in the South. The laws governing their status and their right to hold property were ambiguous and easy for any white person to shred. Jones uses this fragile situation as the setting for a novel about a group of black and white Virginians who tried - sometimes nobly, often viciously - to maintain their world in the face of inevitable collapse. To the extent that Morrison spun a surreal tale of American slavery into mythic proportions, Jones has carved a companion series of stark anecdotes into national legends. In a measured voice that never rises to reflect the agonies and absurdities he describes, he moves back and forth through decades and across state lines, assembling an apparently random collection of brief scenes that gradually fuse into a stunning portrait of moral confusion. The story revolves around Henry Townsend, a black man who, with the indulgence of his former owner, managed to buy his own farm and his own slaves - eventually 29 adults and a collection of children. Henry's parents, who labored tirelessly to free him as a child, are horrified by his participation in the flesh market, but Henry is ambitious, and, what's more, he learned from his master that \"once you own even one, you will never be alone.\" As a protection against loneliness and a way to wealth, Henry can't imagine anything more successful, and he's convinced he can be \"a better master than any white man he had ever known.\" Indeed, he attains that dubious goal, creating a plantation with forced labor that's largely free of physical beatings, but it's an insidious gentility that only camouflages the humiliations of Southern slavery. Nevertheless, his untimely death frightens most of his slaves, who know just how delicate their relative comfort is. Only the brooding overseer, Moses, the first slave Henry ever bought, sees his master's demise as an opportunity - not for freedom, but for taking his place. Indeed, what interests Jones most in this complex novel is the way slavery distorts judgment, not just of those who oppress, but of those who are oppressed. Henry's widow, Caldonia, quickly decides against freeing \"her legacy,\" choosing instead to maintain the plantation in the spirit of Henry's gentle example. \"Her husband had done the best he could,\" she thinks, \"and on Judgment Day his slaves would stand before God and testify to that fact.\" Occasionally, a child is worked to death or a pregnant woman labors in the field till she miscarries, but Caldonia sheds sincere tears, comforts the parents, and considers whether she should buy insurance against further losses of her property. As a single woman with a large business to run, she's encouraged by a collection of family and friends, other free blacks, some of whom own their own slaves, too. One of the most troubling is Fern, Caldonia's prim teacher of literature and etiquette. Together, they keep the irony of their position well buried, while socializing in a kind of racial terrarium maintained by William Robbins, the county's wealthiest white farmer. Estranged from his own wife but protected by his political power, he loves a black woman in town and openly adores his two mulatto children. The Townsend plantation with its little coterie of free slave-owning blacks gives his favorites a place to play and refine themselves. In one of several shifts to the late 19th century, a Canadian historian interviews Fern, Caldonia's teacher, about those days on the plantation. \"All of us do only what the law and God tell us we can do,\" she says without any hint of guilt or remorse. \"We owned slaves. It was what was done, and so that is what we did.\" Jones uses that same tone of historical distance throughout, a tone that amplifies the grotesque mingling of affection and cruelty that infected these people, black and white. In the center of this moral kaleidoscope stands the sheriff, John Skiffington, an earnest Christian, dedicated to the objective application of law and convinced that \"the law always cares\" for everyone equally. It's a doomed endeavor, of course, but as Caldonia's plantation begins to collapse, Skiffington fails to realize that the legal system he's sworn to uphold is not objective and that he cannot remain clean within it. The scrambled collection of events and characters makes this a difficult story to enter, but that structure eventually accounts for much of the novel's evocative power. Jones has a kind of biblical style that suggests whole lives in a few stark details from a perspective that's alternately microscopic and telescopic. It's a technique that resists our efforts to keep these events in some unrecoverable past. The troubling implications of his story leach in through hairline cracks all over the twin shells of antebellum nostalgia and Northern piety. Every time Caldonia cheerfully reminds her friends, \"We are all worthy of one another,\" the legacy of slavery sounds more complex and unresolved. http:\/\/www.csmonitor.com\/2003\/0814\/p1..."

        "text":"Very good book. I have to admit while reading this book on slavery I felt a little ignorant. I never knew that free (former) slaves bought and owned slaves themselves. Just another thing that I did not learn in American history. This book had many characters but the characters were not overwhelming. The characters involve a man who worked hard to buy his freedom and eventually the freedom of his wife and later their child only to see their child prosper and purchase slaves for himself. The book also focuses on his slaves and their relationships. There is also the sheriff and his wife who are given a slave girl as a wedding gift even though they are against slavery they raise her and think of her as their \"child\" All of these stories come together in The Known World."

        "text":"Manchester County, Virginia doesn't exist. Never has. After reading The Known World, however, you'd be forgiven if you thought you could take a tour of it's plantations and slave cemetaries on your vacation to colonial Williamsburg. The complicated pre-civil war Southern society that Edward P. Jones creates feels as real and surreal as any factual history of slavery you've read. It was not so much the story of Henry Townsend, a black slave owner, and all the people that his death allows us to meet that engaged me. It was the world, a world where I could taste the soil I might till and the women I might marry and the terrible choices I might be faced with, that put it's claws in me and refused to let go. It took me nearly 2 months to finish the book's 388 pages. It should've been a quick read. It is a fascinating place with peculiar problems and characters I cried for on more than one occasion. It should've been a quick read but I kept asking myself this question: who would I have been? The slave, toiling away in the field? The overseer, unable to see the world for what it truly was? The freed man, working desperately to free the rest of his family? The smart child, taken under the wing of the rich white slave owner and convinced that there was nothing wrong with owning another human being? The broken black man tortured by his family's wealth built on the backs of men and women that look just like me? The slave too proud, too strong, too powerful to let another take his freedom? Who would I have been? Who am I now? In matters of race, there is always that fool's point, usually made by a white person (though not always) that asks,\"why aren't you over it, already? Can't we just let it go?\" It is a way to end an uncomfortable conversation. The reasons don't matter. I know many a person for which the sticky tar baby of race in America is simply a discussion they can't stick their hands in. It is too difficult. Too raw. Too cloudy to be sure that people will remain friends after an honest chat. The way I feel when I read books like The Known World is my answer. No matter how well-adjusted, how integrated, how loving of my fellow man, how multiculti kumbayah I am, I'm not over it. I can't let it go. This fictional world was very real not all that long ago. It's effects still ripple through our every day. The world I know doesn't exist without it. Highly highly recommended."

        "text":"I know this is a critically acclaimed book, a Pulitzer winner, and a book tackling a difficult and complex stain on America history: slavery and black slave owners. There are moments when the book does say some interesting things or reveal some unsavory and uncomfortable truths, but it was so hard to engage with as a reader. I mean, I hung in with DFW through the first 600 pages of Infinite Jest where nothing happens -- but because I was fascinated by Hal, Orin, Marathe, Steeply, and Mario and Madame Psychosis who all fascinated me. There were literally dozens of other characters but these all pulled me in. In The Known World, there are also dozens of characters but none that I grew any attachment too. It was as if the author Jones was using a hand-held camera and no stabilizer so that the images were jumpy and out of focus. It reminded me sometimes of how the world seems to my myopic eyes between taking off my glasses in the morning and putting in my contact lenses. The narration also highly annoyed me. All the parenthetical \"in 60 years so and so will do such as such\" were meaningless because I was given neither enough time nor enough detail to give a shit. Further, there is this reference to \"years later they would all turn into human torches in front of the dry foods store\", but no mention afterwards of to what this referred. But the most annoying bit was in using the Canadian journalist frame at about page 130 or so (which then only briefly appears in the narrative 200 pages later in a parenthetical throwaway comment, it is said that the journalist would never marry his heart's desire yet 3 pages later, they marry and that coming to talk to Fern that there was some incomprehensible stuff that happens off-screen that morning (also never adequately explained) and so she was not going to open up to the journalist and yet we still find her filling in details about Henry, Moses and Caledonia 30 pages later. Too much inconsistency - was the editor asleep or stoned and missed these? So, despite taking on a complex subject, Jones is no Faulkner as his South does not eve approach that of the Great William. He is not as good as Pynchon or DFW is manipulating time and space in a narrative that was 100 or 150 pages too long and felt it, and he is not Alice Walker or Toni Morrison who brought us the most amazing, poignant, and powerful images of slavery and its residual impacts generations later that I have ever read. So, read Beloved or Absalom, Absalom if you want to hear about the South and I expect you will be less frustrated, but every bit enraged at this deplorable institution that is a cancer on the American past."

        "text":"Ambitious, Interesting, Disorganized In an interview, Edward P. Jones revealed that The Known World took shape around 1) when he heard that Black people had owned slaves and 2) when he read a thin paperback in high school about a Jewish man who decided to join the Nazi party, how he acted in opposition to how one would expect. The Known World is an ambitious novel which aims to describe the world of 1855 where Henry Townsend has recently died. As a result of his death, a cloud of uncertainty hangs in the air as he leaves behind his widow, Caldonia, and the undetermined fate of the slaves he purchased to work his land. Although the plot is interesting, this book is disorganized. It covers many different characters and rapidly shifts time periods. I would be reading along and then the text would say “and this person lived to be 93 years old and had 235 grandchildren.” (paraphrasing) Countless times, I had to stop and reread because the storytelling was so clunky. In The Known World, there are quite a few references to Adam and Eve, even references to Milton (Paradise Lost). My favorite author, Philip Pullman, loves to talk about this topic and how in his works he wanted his characters to find their way back to The Garden by taking the long way around. So this quote on page 329 stood out: “There was a long way around but he chose not to take it.” There is a character in The Known World by the name of Anderson Frazier. He creates and distributes pamphlets and interviews Fern Elston. In my opinion, this pamphlet could have provided a framework to systematically organize the characters instead of the resulting jumbled and confusing soup of characters and timelines. The Known World has some unforgettable moments, but the organization of the narrative reduces the enjoyment of the reading experience.

        "text":"This is a complex novel, with dense writing, a non-linear structure, and an abundance of characters. It reads much like a true historical account of a place, Manchester County, Virginia, and time, pre-Civil War 1800s. This could very nearly have passed for a non-fiction book; each character feels so real, their personal stories and histories so authentic. The author even goes so far as to tell us what happens to many of them ten, twenty or even fifty years in the future. And yet, Edward P. Jones himself states: \"The county and town of Manchester, Virginia, and every human being in those places, are products of my imagination… The census records I made up for Manchester were, again, simply to make the reader feel that the town and the county and the people lived and breathed in central Virginia once upon a time…\" Well, consider me duped. At first I really thought such a county existed and the data presented were genuine facts. As my son passed through the living room, I even shouted out some sort of statistic or another and asked if he had ever read about such a thing in his history classes. He couldn’t recall, but it sounded ‘familiar’. Right, because much of this could have been true, yet it wasn’t. The institution of slavery of course was all too real and cruel, and that’s what this book is about, and this is the truth. Slavery in all its forms is evil. Henry Townsend is a black farmer. He is a former slave that with the purchase of freedom and some land becomes a slave owner himself. Henry and his wife Caldonia own a small plantation near the border of his former master’s much larger one. I could not wrap my head around why on earth a freed man would ever want to enslave another human being. Henry and other black slave owners like him justify their actions: \"Henry had always said that he wanted to be a better master than any white man he had ever known. He did not understand that the kind of world he wanted to create was doomed before he had even spoken the first syllable of the word master.\" Well, as the old saying goes, ‘the road to hell is paved with good intentions.’ When Henry dies, all hell breaks loose, and we begin to see the ill-fated consequences of an institution that is immoral and corrupt. A narrative that seems to jump around in time and between characters eventually comes together into a whole as consequences and events snowball out of control. Lives are permanently changed. Some for the worst, others (we hope) for the better. They all become woven together much like the massive tapestry hanging on the wall of another place in another time. Each is part of the story. Everyone is responsible for the events which passed, were allowed to pass despite the huge injustice to humanity. This book is not easy to read. The structure is challenging and the topic is gloomy, albeit important. What happens to the people we grow to care for is often horrifying and heartbreaking. But it is well-written and extremely impactful. An important novel which is well worth your time and attention if you are up for the challenge. It won't suit everyone, but if you are at all interested, I encourage you to pick this one up. \"What I feared most at that moment is what I still fear: that they would remember my history, that I, no matter what I had always said to the contrary, owned people of our Race.\""

I'd read you, you'd provide enlightenment or emotional catharsis or entertainment, maybe even all three. All the signs were there: the laudatory quotes on your jacket, a shocking and unexpected premise, high marks on goodreads. But something was just off by the end of the first chapter. Maybe it was the masturbation scene right at the start. Or the characters that I just couldn't get into - I could hardly tell some of them apart. Or the way the narrative seemed to skip all over without any focus. Maybe I just didn't give you enough pages. I'm sure you got better as you went along.

        "text":"There’s irony that I read more than half of this wrenching, ugly, hopeful, stirring, and grievous book while holding a sleeping baby in my arms. Because there is a lot of life and death in this take on pre-Civil War Virginia. I knew little about the book except that the author wrote it after reading about freed Black folks owning slaves. In delving into this issue, which in any modern conversation circle must bring dissonance, disbelief, and maybe even disgust, I became increasingly moved and disturbed. A difficult book, both because it’s an unflinching look at slavery, but also because it’s written in a James Joyce-ish style — lots of asides and stream of consciousness text. The author careens from generation to generation and back again in often the same paragraph. Yet it worked for me. It reads like a memoir of an entire county’s 150-year history complete with dozens of families represented. What results is simply, UNFORGETTABLE. There are characters whose faces I imagined while reading and characters whose stories I became invested in that will haunt me. Not in the truth of a fictional characterization but more because the ugliness of humanity was so blatantly on display and sadly remains real to this day. As I bid farewell to the slaves, slaveowners, children of both and ministers, sheriffs and patrollers of this novel, I will not forget their names. And I can’t help but wonder who would I have been in Manchester County, Virginia? (Reviewed 2\/12\/25)"

        "text":"I'm going to have to rave a bit, because this is one of the best books I've read in the past ten years. Jones packs in all the historical detail you could want, and of course he's hit on a subject--black slaveowners--that in and of itself is tabloid-sensational. Where lesser writers might lean too hard on the sensational aspect (or rely on it to bolster an otherwise weak narrative), Jones works it into a compelling and powerful story. What makes it so powerful is a mix of fascinating characters who are woven into a series of overlapping plotlines. For me it's the structuring that is so brilliant (geek alert: I actually diagrammed the time shifts in the chapters as an exercise, to see when and how Jones yoked the whole thing together). This less than linear approach might be frustrating to those who just want things to be straightforward, but stick with it: the shifts provide suspense as well as texture, and they propel more than one storyline at once. They do all come together, trust me. I also admire the overarching authorial voice in the novel, which certainly leans toward the formal, but also comes across as aware of the history it's grappling with: here and there Jones projects his voice forward for a moment, or seemingly digresses with factual material and research. Again it's all part of the tapestry and the mix, and I also think that the level of narrative awareness (which never disengages long enough to derail anything) adds another layer to the very idea of history--making the whole historical and contemporary both. And for those of you who can do without all of the above writerly blather (a thousand pardons), you'll find in this book characters who are engaging, ignorant, cruel, earnest, sympathetic, tragic, hopeful, flawed--in short, complicated. Halfway through you'll be fighting off the impulse to skip ahead to learn everyone's fate. Finally, I'll say that this book isn't perfect--there are aspects of what I've described above that sometimes don't work: narrative turns that do seem pointless digressions, a character or two a bit stereotypical or annoying. No matter. This book aims high, as brilliant works of art do, and the result is nothing short of amazing."

        "text":"This book demands that you read it slowly and intently. Like eating a huge Thanksgiving dinner, you need to pause and digest before you have the next course. At the outset, the plot seems to be all over the place, bouncing from character to character, telling too many stories, not telling enough and then seeming to tell too much. Ah, but then, you make a little progress and the rhythm begins to assert itself, the stories begin to weave together, the minute details begin to become a diorama, the picture stops being a blur and comes into sharp focus. This isn’t one man’s story, or even the story of one place, this is the story of all men and this is the tale of a world. This book is not so much about race as it is about the abject insanity and evil of the institution of slavery, wherever it is found, whoever is practicing it. In this system, there are free black masters holding black slaves, some of them well-meaning, but it does not make the practice any less immoral. There are white men who love their black mistresses and the children they bear, but it does not remove the fact that they hold a dominion over them that is not borne of love in any of its guises. There are also individuals who are victims of the system and others who refuse to be victims of the system, even at the cost of their lives. I loved many of Jones’ characters, notably Augustus and Mildred Townsend. They exemplify what is the best in us. I felt sorry for some of them, like Sheriff John Skiffington, who would like to be better than this society allows him to be, and Caldonia Townsend’s brother, Calvin, who wishes to go to New York so that he will not have to bear witness to the cruelties around him, cruelties he must realized have escaped him only because of a trick of fortune. I despised some of them, and I recognized most of them. The petty and jealous, who must have dominion over someone to feel they have worth; the ungrateful and traitorous, who would turn upon a friend to put some silver in their own pockets; the meek and hopeless, who bow to the yoke and try simply to find a corner in which they are allowed to exist; the defiant and strong-minded, who fight with their last breath because to do otherwise is to prop up the indefensible; all are here. What I loved most about this novel is its genuineness, its lack of exaggeration or hyperbole, where surely none is needed, its emphasis on the day-to-day injustice of an institution that is accepted as insurmountable or even correct only because it is what is. Edward P. Jones has leveled an attack at the heart of mankind and defied one to imagine what they would have done, what they would have dared to do, in such a place and time."

        "text":"A very complex and beautiful, compelling book about Henry, a former slave who becomes a slave owner, & his wife Caldonia. But they're just the start - the book is really a series of stories & vignettes about the families, friends, neighbors & community surrounding Henry & Caldonia. It took me a really long time to get into the book, because there are so many characters, some important & some not, & the book jumps around in time, making it difficult to follow. Trust me, use the cast of characters at the end of this edition (why not place this at the beginning?!) & give up your expectations about traditional narrative format, & you'll LOVE this book as much as I did. In life, we have our own story kind of playing in our head, & at the same time we have all these other stories we're hearing - the story about your mother's great-uncle. The story about your brother in law's neighbor. The one about your sister's husband's aunt & her neighbor. the one about your coworker's mother. You know all those stories? That's what this book is like - some characters are more important than others, so you hear more of their stories, but minor characters have stories too, & they sort of appear out of nowhere, & you get to hear their story, & then they're gone. It's really very cool! I particularly loved the story of the womanizing slave who has a vision during a lightning storm\/tornado - & becomes the founder of an orphanage. And the little tiny story about the family who don't want to give up their cow, & the woman goes into the barn to milk the cow & there's this lovely description of her squirting the cow's milk into a cat's mouth, & if you've ever seen a cat eat with true contentment you will recognize the cat body language that Jones describes. Toward the end of the book there's a very powerful scene where a character, who isn't a particularly \"good\" character, says there should be a lantern or light of truth in the world, an actual place where people can stand & tell the truth without fear of retribution, where one might be able to right a wrong. It's a moment where you think, yes this guy could right the wrong by speaking out, because his fear of having people think he's \"on the negro's side\" is...well, wrong! But that's his fear & in that moment of the book you understand it & you think, yeah, what if he could speak out under that light of truth & not have anyone judge him? How wonderful would that be? While the book depicts the horrors of slavery, & there are a few characters who are outright despicable, there are many shades of gray in Jones' vision as well. It's a book that will make you think about slavery, the myths & realities & tragedies of it all, & on top of that it'll make you think about your own life & all the people you've known & how complex & interesting we all are, really. It's beautifully written & the characters will stick in your head as if you'd known them too. Oddly, I think what I initially disliked most about this book - its multitude of characters & convoluted timeline - is what I ended up really enjoying! Another example of a book that made my head expand, with some creakiness, but I'm glad the expansion can still happen!"

        "text":"In this book I learned that there used to be black slaveholders in the US. I thought that only white people were allowed to own slaves during the time that owning slaves were like owning properties. During that pre-Abolition time. During those sad dark days in the American history. Black Edward P. Jones (born 1951) wrote this historical epic novel, The Known World based on the not well known fact that there were some black slaveholders (black people owning black slaves) in the state of Virginia during the time in the US when owning slave is legal. Wikipedia has this to say: \"Slavery in the United States was a form of unfree labor which existed as a legal institution in North America for more than a century before the founding of the United States in 1776, and continued mostly in the South until the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution in 1865.[1] The first English colony in North America, Virginia, first imported Africans in 1619, a practice earlier established in the Spanish colonies as early as the 1560s.[2] Most slaves were black and were held by whites, although some Native Americans and free blacks also held slaves; there were a small number of white slaves as well.[3]\" Winner of the 2004 Pulitzer Award for Fiction, The Known World is one of the most memorable reads I had this year. It is not an easy book to read. This 388-page novel left me with a heavy chest each time I closed the book. Each page is gloomy and sad. The novel is well-told with lyrical prose creating a big canvas of imagery in one's mind while reading. In that big canvas are memorable and three-dimensional numerous characters most of them black slaves. No character is downright bad or good. The detailed description of the sceneries of a fictional county called Manchester and the true depictions of the characters are exceptionally striking that I had to slow down in my reading to savor the story and hold on *tugging to them, cheering them on* to each characters. Reading the last page left me with a heavy heart. I would not want to let go of that image of Manchester and say goodbye Please don't go yet to the characters that I already became part of my literary world. The world that resides in the recesses of my brain. The world that is known only to me populated by people who I met only in my readings. In terms of writing, Jones extensively use the technique called prolepsis that I first encountered reading Muriel Sparks' The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie (1961). Jones explained this in the interview (appendix of the book) saying that he is the God of those characters so he knows what happened in the life of each characters from the time he\/she was born up to the time his\/her death. The most moving example of this use was with the character of the child Tessie . One fine day of September 1855, their mistress Caldonia saw the 5-y\/o Tessie playing with a wooden toy horse. Caldonia says to the child: That is very nice, Tessie to which Tessie responded, My papa did this for me . In January 2002, on her deathbed, the old Tessie asked her caretaker to get the wooden toy horse from the attic. While holding the toy, she breathed her last saying the same thing: My papa did this for me . My heart stopped beating. Tears welled up in my eyes. That scene is just one of the many moving scenes about those slaves in that time of the history in Virginia when black people were traded like they were not human but properties. I can make this review very long. There are just too many good things I would like to say here but I am afraid that no review can make justice to a book as good as this."

Free blacks owned other black people. Some free blacks bought their family members and others just wanted the slave labor. Native Americans owned slaves for much of the same reasons. The Known World introduces us to some of those people. The Known World has won a whole gang of awards, so we know its an important book and the writing is top notch. My only problems with the book were the fact that there were too many characters. You know this is a pet peeve of mine and I lost track of all the characters in this book. My other problem was that it jumped backwards and forwards in time way too much. Most of the time jumps were super confusing. I liked The Known World but I think I might not be smart enough to read this book. I'll probably reread it sometime in the future and I do recommend to others because its a brilliant book."

However, any plot that might exist was buried so deep beneath the convoluted chronology and extraneous characters and details that I decided I didn't care to keep digging for it, and quit on page 198. The author seemed determined to insert every existing anecdote about slavery into one novel. This might have worked better as a compilation of essays or short stories."

While I was reading, I kept on going \"what did I just read? Am I really reading\/understanding this book?\" and kept on referring to the back cover of the book. No. The story was simply what I read. O.......K! Then ugh. I HATE leaving a book unread, so I kept on forcing myself to read thru the whole book. Finally the misery I was putting myself through ended, and UGH! The storyline. The author kept on jumping around the timeline too much - and honestly - I would describe this book as a glimpse of the lives of slaves in the south, but with a blah storyline. However this book has won a pultizer prize. EH!? Anyone out there who has read this book? Your opinions?? However like always, we learn from books. What I got out of this book was a new knowledge I never came upon, that black people owned black slaves.They even buy their own family members, and the slaves were considered as properties, including family. Hmm... History is richier than we will ever know or think of."

        "text":"The Known World does this weird thing: it cites its sources. And it's weird because they don't exist. There are passages like this: [Manchester, VA] went through a period of years and years of what University of Virginia historian Roberta Murphy in a 1948 book would call 'peace and prosperity'. Jones goes on to tell you the publication history of that book, and a few more things about what was in it, and to imply that Roberta Murphy was a little racist. But there is no Roberta Murphy, there is no book, there is no Manchester, VA. What is Jones up to? Wyatt Mason notes : What research on the subject Jones undertook was, in fact, quickly derailed after he happened upon an account of a white slave owner who spent her days abusing one of her black slaves, a little girl, by beating her head against a wall. “If I had wanted to tell the whole story of slavery, Americans couldn’t have taken that,” Jones told an interviewer. “People want to think that there was slavery, and then we got beyond it. People don’t want to hear that a woman would take a child and bang her head against the wall day after day. It’s nice that I didn’t read all those books. What I would have had to put down is far, far harsher and bleaker. Too much of a bummer? It's not that The Known World is a feel-good novel. Ears and Achilles tendons will be sliced. It follows the rules of slavery books: slave narratives always had happy endings; later, fictional slave narratives always have sad endings. But Toni Morrison has a different opinion about what Americans can and can't take. Shit, so does Harriet Jacobs. And Jones knows this, so he's being disingenuous. And you notice that he's talking about books he didn't actually read. NPR says, Jones collected two shelves of books about slavery, but never got around to reading them. Still, the author was able to use his imagination, and stories he had heard growing up, to make his characters come alive. \"I decided the people I'd created were real enough and I had just accumulated enough information about what the world was like in the South before 1865 to allow me to lie and get away with it,\" he says. Look, I don't mean to say Jones isn't telling the truth. I don't know if he is, and neither does he; neither of us read those two shelves of books about slavery. But the citation of imaginary sources in the book itself serves to either add authenticity that's undeserved, or - if you follow up on those sources - underline its lack of authenticity. I'm puzzled by it. This sort of meta-sourcing has been done before - by Nabokov in Pale Fire, by Cervantes, and in its closest parallel by Borges in his first collection, Universal History of Iniquity, which also confused me. It's especially jarring here, maybe just because I find the truth of slavery a fraught subject, and maybe because the layers go so deep - even in interviews about his lack of authenticity, he appears to be consciously inauthentic. I don't know, man, I don't get it. But anyway: is it a good made-up story about made-up people? Yeah, sure, totally. Eventually. The first half is a little annoying. There's a lot of chronological foofarah - skipping all over the place for no pressing reason - and a ginormous cast it's hard to keep track of, and our super-omniscient narrator often takes time out to tell you some trivial character's entire life story, which you didn't really need. But the second half ratchets up the tension to pure shit-your-pantsville, as that sprawling cast all meet their assorted fates. It makes up for some irritation in the first half. So yeah, as a novel it's excellent. The authenticity issue, I bring up mostly because we take this book seriously; it won a Pulitzer. It deserves to be looked carefully at. I looked carefully and I was confused by its truth."

        "text":"Despite some luminous moments where the characters come alive in a special way, this novel about the lives of slaves in a fictional community in Virginia of the 1830s felt too hermetic and sealed off for me to enjoy it as thoroughly as others might. The special hook that the story holds is its rendering of freed blacks who became slave owners themselves. The focus is on one such plantation with about 30 slaves which is struggling to adapt to the death of its black master, Henry Townsend. We get a plausible history along the way of how his father, Augustus, was so talented at furniture making that he bought his own freedom, and state legislative action allowed him to continue residing in the state and eventually bought the freedom of his son. With other free blacks, such as the feisty, condescending teacher Fern, who came from the North, they form a small society of their own. While Augustus abhors slavery, his son tries to emulate the path taken by the whites to economic success by owning slaves. Despite an ambition to become a benevolent master, the corrupting influence of owning people as property is well portrayed. When his lonely widow takes up a love relationship with her plantation foreman, she is replicating the same abuse of power enacted by most other white plantation owners, and the consequences are tragic. The “known world” of plantation life in this fictional county is like an island in time, and the characters themselves seem stuck in it like insects in amber. The omniscient narrator is god-like in passing into the thoughts and dreams of more than a dozen characters. Unfortunately, the reader gets distanced from emotionally connecting to them by the narrator breaking the flow to leap backward and forward in time to reveal some particular fact or person’s fate (for more see: D.D. Wood review ). Ultimately, the human bonds holding people to each other came off as tenuous and unreal as beholding a ship in a bottle. Unlike the romanticized lives portrayed in Hailey’s “Roots”, the characters have no sense of cultural history of their African origins (the word itself appears nowhere in the book), and there is no foreshadowing of plantation life as a doomed phase in history on the path to the Civil War. The idea of a slave revolt is unthinkable, and the one humane white character, Sheriff Skiffington, feels no compunction over diligently carrying out a big part of his job in organizing night patrols and retrieval efforts when “property” runs away. Though we get no sense of the reality of the “Underground Railroad”, we do get a brilliant vision at one point where Augustus ends up mailing a slave girl to Philadelphia in a crate along with a shipment of his hand-carved walking sticks. In an interview with Jones appended to the audiobook version of the novel, he admits he did not do much research for the book and was not concerned about communicating any particular message to his readers about the history of slavery. As the creator of all the characters, he would not admit to favoring any one character over another. Still the reader can’t help but getting the message of how inhumane slavery was and how individuals trapped in it strived to achieve some form of dignity in their lives. Like other reviewers, I didn’t feel I got to know any of the characters well enough to get emotionally engaged with them. When not interrupted by invasions from the narrator, the prose is effective in evoking the place and time, an obvious factor in helping it gain a Pulitzer Prize. Here is a lovely example from the opening for the book: The evening his master dies he worked again well after he ended the day for the other adults, his own wife among them, and sent them back with hunger and tiredness to their cabins. The young ones, his son among them, had been sent out of the fields an hour or so before the adults, to prepare the late supper and, if there was time enough, to play in a few minutes of sun that were left. When he, Moses, finally freed himself of the ancient and brittle harness that connected him to the oldest mule his master owned, all that was left of the sun was a five-inch long memory of red orange laid out in still waves across the horizon between two mountains on the left and one on the right. He had been in the fields for all of fourteen hours. He paused before leaving the fields as the evening quiet wrapped itself about him. The mule quivered, wanting home and rest. Moses closed his eyes and bent down and took a pinch of the soil and ate it with no more thought than if it were a spot of cornbread. …he ate it not only to discover the strengths and weaknesses of the field, but because eating it tied him to the only thing in his small world that meant almost as much as his own life."

        "text":"Glorious account that gets past cliches. The premise is that two slaves in 1840s Virginia bought their freedom, but their son stayed a little too long under the master's care. What does the family do when the son starts his own farm and buys his own slaves? The mastery of Jones' writing comes in the sense of history that he lends to minute objects, chance encounters, and incantatory reveries within a frought landscape. Not content to write an unwritten history of forgotten people, Jones re-writes the histories that have been written, citing documents the purport to explain the historical phenomenon of free blacks who owned slaves. Passages that carry runaway characters to the north also tie in academic treatises from the next century, deeds and warrants and court decisions that attempted to justify white supremacy, and the momentoes that emancipated children carry to their deathbeds. Jones doesn't neglect to include tales of individual transformation, collective redemption, or international implications in this epic. Characters may come and go like fleeting ghosts, yet the marks they leave may remain. When the words of the plantation master and deeds of the escaped overseer have faded into ineffectual memory, we readers are left with both the sense that an institution has gone horribly wrong and that the people within it can be honorably right; even if the results remain unapparent, the promise of future change remains, along with the threat of complacency and neglect. Jones didn't attempt to detail the national debate over slavery that was current at that time. That limitation on his project was probably a good one. It allows us to see the human effects that rhetoric had covered, and allowed him to devote his attentions to demonstrating the range of positions that people could occupy in relation to the institution. Yes, whether you're descended from a slave, a master, a freed man, a black woman passing as white, an unwilling overseer, a treacherous deputy, a conscientious drunk, or an immigrant Irishwoman sold into prostitution, there's something in this book for you - and I wish that I was only joking, but the irony is that there is no irony here, and sincerity is the least of what we have to do, and memory is only the start of making a history that hasn't stopped."

        "text":"Set in antebellum Virginia, a former slave, Henry Townsend, owns fifty acres of land and thirty-three slaves. As the story opens, Townsend is dying. The novel chronicles his life, the lives of his family members, and the lives of people he encountered in the community. The main characters are three-dimensional and feel like real people, with both admirable traits and flaws. Jones employs an omniscient narrator and non-linear storytelling. He weaves together overlapping stories of past and present events, such that the reader knows what happens to these people in the future before knowing what has happened to them in the book’s “present.” There are a great many characters in this book and the list of Dramatis Personae is helpful in keeping them all straight. This novel is based on a lesser known historical fact. While it was not common, it did happen that some free blacks owned slaves. It lends a complexity to the slavery narrative – showing how people can be impacted by society’s strictures and how victims of exploitation could become perpetrators of the same system. This is not a quick and easy read. It feels like being immersed in the life and times of Manchester County, Virginia, in the 1850s. It is an eloquently written condemnation of oppression in any form. This book won the Pulitzer Prize in 2004."

        "text":"2.5-stars, really. here is a perfect example of a books i should love, and yet.... i didn't. the book was a lot of work and, for me, very little reward. i think most of my issues are because of the style\/structure of the novel: * the third-person, omniscient narrator - this was distracting from very early on in the read. i held off judging it. i wanted to trust jones and his choice. * non-linear narrative - i don't tend to have problems with this at all, but i found it super-clunky here. also distracting. * the made-up references - jones would cite sources and details that seemed to lend such an air of gravitas, but none of it is actually real. (i know, i know. this is fiction. a novel. get over it. but it was just kinda weird to me. social commentary inserted into fiction happens. steinbeck did it. teju cole does it. many writers do this. i felt like jones did a crap-ton of research for this book. but then i read this NPR piece . in it, he notes he collected 2 shelves worth of books on slavery... \"but never got around to reading them\" . so this just added to my 'what the?' on the references in the novel and jones' research.) * all of this combined for a really awkward flow, and convoluted storytelling. i felt like it could lose 50-100 pages and be a tighter, better story. in case you think maybe i am a lazy reader - i'm not, i swear! i love nothing more than a meaty, tough read. jones' story is definitely both of these things. he explores the issue of free black people owning slaves in virginia, and he gives us a large cast of active characters. but it all felt so... surface-y. we get the actions and reactions, but we don't really get the motivations or emotions. jones is navigating a morally dodgy landscape, one i would have loved to have gone into more deeply. we are given the horrors and the heartbreaks, but it all felt so detached. and, you know, maybe that is totally on purpose. maybe, for some people, detachment is the only way through such a horrible time in history. jones has collected some serious critical acclaim and recognition over his career. to name a few: he's won the pulitzer, the national book critic's circle award, the PEN\/Hemingway award, a MacArthur genius grant, and the International IMPAC dublin literary award. he's won nearly $1 million in literary awards alone. the man knows what he's doing, and the respect he's earned is fairly universal. the known world is an important story. but is just shining the light on the issues jones raises enough? so now i am back to the should . i should love this book. (it was just okay for me.) people should read this book. (indeed. but this is not a book i will blanket recommend to all.) so, i don't know you guys. i am bummed over this one. and this is a terrible review\/collection of thoughts. maybe i'll become more coherent with some distance and fix this up a bit - but for now i wanted to note down something here. (aside #1 (going to be a bit spoiler-y here): moses confused me. or, rather, his turn to all-of-a-sudden being an asshole was weird. we're going along with moses. he seems like a lovely man. then, halfway into the book, he's a wife-beater, jerkface? where did that come from, and why was he presented like that? the reveal of moses being a not nice man was sudden and odd.) (aside #2: worth noting (was hugely interesting to me) - the cover photo of this edition is © Eudora Welty ! i had no idea about her photographic prowess .)"

On top of that, the book has won all sorts of prizes: *Pulitzer Prize for Fiction (2004) *International Dublin Literary Award (2005) *Anisfield-Wolf Book Award (2004) *National Book Critics Circle Award for Fiction (2003) * Hurston\/Wright Legacy Award Nominee for Debut Fiction (\/2004 *National Book Award Finalist for Fiction (2003) I knew I had to give it a try. I am glad I have read it, but to say I like it, would just not be true. It’s OK, so I am giving it two stars. There is no real central character to the story, because he dies right off the bat. It is 1855 when Henry Townsend dies. He is black. He had been a slave, but his parents had bought him his freedom. He leaves behind no children but a wife, Caldonia, a twenty-eight-year-old educated black woman born free, and his property of thirty-three slaves and fifty acres in Manchester County, Virginia. The book is about the hell that breaks loose afterwards, but really what it is about is life in the South during the antebellum era, about the mindset of Blacks and Whites of this era. The story is told by an omniscient narrator—who knows how each character thinks, what has happened to all of them in the past and what will happen to all of them in the future. It is this all-seeing narrator that shapes the entire feel of the story. This narrator knows everything, but he is not particularly adept at cogently telling a story. In one sentence you may switch form the present to the future and back again. In the next sentence you flip back to the past. It is easy to become confused. Character upon character is thrown at you, with little tidbits about their lives in the past, present and future. You are given an entire community of individuals—Whites and Blacks, a Native American or two, those who are free and those who are slaves, a sheriff and his deputy. The omniscient narrator is constantly restating who each one is, which is good in one sense, but the flow of the tale becomes jerky. Stop and start, backward and forward and often confusing. Use of the omniscient narrator is pushed to the extreme. It is kind of nice to have a character or two to guide you through a story. You do not have that here. There are a whole group of characters, characters that are hard to attach yourself to. You do not get close to any one individual. In the afterword the author points out that he wanted to draw characters that were neither all good nor all bad, each one different in their own way. You do get that here, but you fail to feel anything for any of them. What you do get is a strong sense of being one of a large community. You are there, one among many, living in the antebellum South. This does give one a hands-on feeling of life then and there and how people were thinking. Kevin Free narrates the audiobook. It is simple to follow, the speed is fine and he intonations are well done. The narration performance is good so I have given the narration three stars."

I don't remember which book I suggested then, but I recall one woman in particular who really loved this book (or I believe she was more in love with Edward Jones' writing). At the end of the workshop we had a gift exchange raffle and she included this book as her contribution. I was the lucky recipient of this free copy. I was interested in this historical novel set in a fictional place in Virginia during the antebellum era, about a former slave who ends up owning slaves. The strangeness of the story and the angle it takes as a slave narrative is intriguing. Also appealing is the way the omniscient narration allows the reader to approach the story without the moral judgement one reserves for this kind of story, since the distance of the narration allows one to realize quickly what the story tries to showcase: how slavery has already poisoned the integrity of all involved. The framework of the novel is composed of anecdotal stories within stories, with pacing often interrupted for a mini scene or two, or an introduction of yet another character who may reappear later or simply disappear. Put another way, it is a book of puzzle pieces: one is added, taken away, another picked up, oh yes, there's the whole, whoops, maybe not, here goes another piece. So although I admired the writing and story setup in the beginning, I just was not in the right space to complete this novel. It has been a while since I added a book to my \"did-not-finish\" list; alas, this one has just made the list. This is not a failed attempt at reading this novel, however, because I remember not being able to finish Ngugi wa Thiong'o's Wizard of the Crow only to later fall in love with his novel, Petals of Blood .

While not exactly removing race from the issue of slavery, Jones is able to show that even among African-Americans the perniciousness of slavery could damn a generation. The best summary of this idea came from a NYTimes review: 'There are few certified villains in this novel, white or black, because slavery poisons moral judgments at the root. As Jones shows, slavery corrupts good intentions and underwrites bad ones, yet allows decency the odd occasion -- but only by creating such an enormous need for it.' The pacing and structure of this novel could be a little challenging to some, but I found that it fit the narrative perfectly. This isn't a novel that burns you with its quotable sentences, but it scars you with its images. There were periods in it where I thought I was reading a Cormac McCarthy novel. That alone is high praise."

        "text":"When Toni Morrison began her research for \"Beloved,\" she discovered a trove of ghastly instruments. She knew, of course, that slaves were routinely whipped, starved, raped, and hanged, but the existence of specially forged tools was a surprise: metal bits forced down the throat, iron masks locked across the face, spiked collars clasped around the neck. Her Pulitzer Prize-winning novel reintroduced those horrors into the national memory and did much to demonstrate that the cruelties of slavery extended far beyond hard labor and physical deprivation. \"The Known World,\" by Edward Jones, reclaims another peculiarity of American slavery and in the process illustrates yet again that we can't under- estimate its perverse contortions of the human spirit. Bizarre as it sounds, in Louisiana, Virginia, and South Carolina, a small number of free blacks owned their own plantations - and their own slaves. It was a precarious arrangement, to be sure. Blacks who were freed or managed to buy their own freedom had little incentive to tarry in the South. The laws governing their status and their right to hold property were ambiguous and easy for any white person to shred. Jones uses this fragile situation as the setting for a novel about a group of black and white Virginians who tried - sometimes nobly, often viciously - to maintain their world in the face of inevitable collapse. To the extent that Morrison spun a surreal tale of American slavery into mythic proportions, Jones has carved a companion series of stark anecdotes into national legends. In a measured voice that never rises to reflect the agonies and absurdities he describes, he moves back and forth through decades and across state lines, assembling an apparently random collection of brief scenes that gradually fuse into a stunning portrait of moral confusion. The story revolves around Henry Townsend, a black man who, with the indulgence of his former owner, managed to buy his own farm and his own slaves - eventually 29 adults and a collection of children. Henry's parents, who labored tirelessly to free him as a child, are horrified by his participation in the flesh market, but Henry is ambitious, and, what's more, he learned from his master that \"once you own even one, you will never be alone.\" As a protection against loneliness and a way to wealth, Henry can't imagine anything more successful, and he's convinced he can be \"a better master than any white man he had ever known.\" Indeed, he attains that dubious goal, creating a plantation with forced labor that's largely free of physical beatings, but it's an insidious gentility that only camouflages the humiliations of Southern slavery. Nevertheless, his untimely death frightens most of his slaves, who know just how delicate their relative comfort is. Only the brooding overseer, Moses, the first slave Henry ever bought, sees his master's demise as an opportunity - not for freedom, but for taking his place. Indeed, what interests Jones most in this complex novel is the way slavery distorts judgment, not just of those who oppress, but of those who are oppressed. Henry's widow, Caldonia, quickly decides against freeing \"her legacy,\" choosing instead to maintain the plantation in the spirit of Henry's gentle example. \"Her husband had done the best he could,\" she thinks, \"and on Judgment Day his slaves would stand before God and testify to that fact.\" Occasionally, a child is worked to death or a pregnant woman labors in the field till she miscarries, but Caldonia sheds sincere tears, comforts the parents, and considers whether she should buy insurance against further losses of her property. As a single woman with a large business to run, she's encouraged by a collection of family and friends, other free blacks, some of whom own their own slaves, too. One of the most troubling is Fern, Caldonia's prim teacher of literature and etiquette. Together, they keep the irony of their position well buried, while socializing in a kind of racial terrarium maintained by William Robbins, the county's wealthiest white farmer. Estranged from his own wife but protected by his political power, he loves a black woman in town and openly adores his two mulatto children. The Townsend plantation with its little coterie of free slave-owning blacks gives his favorites a place to play and refine themselves. In one of several shifts to the late 19th century, a Canadian historian interviews Fern, Caldonia's teacher, about those days on the plantation. \"All of us do only what the law and God tell us we can do,\" she says without any hint of guilt or remorse. \"We owned slaves. It was what was done, and so that is what we did.\" Jones uses that same tone of historical distance throughout, a tone that amplifies the grotesque mingling of affection and cruelty that infected these people, black and white. In the center of this moral kaleidoscope stands the sheriff, John Skiffington, an earnest Christian, dedicated to the objective application of law and convinced that \"the law always cares\" for everyone equally. It's a doomed endeavor, of course, but as Caldonia's plantation begins to collapse, Skiffington fails to realize that the legal system he's sworn to uphold is not objective and that he cannot remain clean within it. The scrambled collection of events and characters makes this a difficult story to enter, but that structure eventually accounts for much of the novel's evocative power. Jones has a kind of biblical style that suggests whole lives in a few stark details from a perspective that's alternately microscopic and telescopic. It's a technique that resists our efforts to keep these events in some unrecoverable past. The troubling implications of his story leach in through hairline cracks all over the twin shells of antebellum nostalgia and Northern piety. Every time Caldonia cheerfully reminds her friends, \"We are all worthy of one another,\" the legacy of slavery sounds more complex and unresolved. http:\/\/www.csmonitor.com\/2003\/0814\/p1..."

The tale jumps back and forth in time, so we know ahead the fate of some, but not all the main characters. The endings, as there are many for the diverse characters tend towards the awful, but not all fit that description."

        "text":"Very good book. I have to admit while reading this book on slavery I felt a little ignorant. I never knew that free (former) slaves bought and owned slaves themselves. Just another thing that I did not learn in American history. This book had many characters but the characters were not overwhelming. The characters involve a man who worked hard to buy his freedom and eventually the freedom of his wife and later their child only to see their child prosper and purchase slaves for himself. The book also focuses on his slaves and their relationships. There is also the sheriff and his wife who are given a slave girl as a wedding gift even though they are against slavery they raise her and think of her as their \"child\" All of these stories come together in The Known World."

        "text":"Manchester County, Virginia doesn't exist. Never has. After reading The Known World, however, you'd be forgiven if you thought you could take a tour of it's plantations and slave cemetaries on your vacation to colonial Williamsburg. The complicated pre-civil war Southern society that Edward P. Jones creates feels as real and surreal as any factual history of slavery you've read. It was not so much the story of Henry Townsend, a black slave owner, and all the people that his death allows us to meet that engaged me. It was the world, a world where I could taste the soil I might till and the women I might marry and the terrible choices I might be faced with, that put it's claws in me and refused to let go. It took me nearly 2 months to finish the book's 388 pages. It should've been a quick read. It is a fascinating place with peculiar problems and characters I cried for on more than one occasion. It should've been a quick read but I kept asking myself this question: who would I have been? The slave, toiling away in the field? The overseer, unable to see the world for what it truly was? The freed man, working desperately to free the rest of his family? The smart child, taken under the wing of the rich white slave owner and convinced that there was nothing wrong with owning another human being? The broken black man tortured by his family's wealth built on the backs of men and women that look just like me? The slave too proud, too strong, too powerful to let another take his freedom? Who would I have been? Who am I now? In matters of race, there is always that fool's point, usually made by a white person (though not always) that asks,\"why aren't you over it, already? Can't we just let it go?\" It is a way to end an uncomfortable conversation. The reasons don't matter. I know many a person for which the sticky tar baby of race in America is simply a discussion they can't stick their hands in. It is too difficult. Too raw. Too cloudy to be sure that people will remain friends after an honest chat. The way I feel when I read books like The Known World is my answer. No matter how well-adjusted, how integrated, how loving of my fellow man, how multiculti kumbayah I am, I'm not over it. I can't let it go. This fictional world was very real not all that long ago. It's effects still ripple through our every day. The world I know doesn't exist without it. Highly highly recommended."

        "text":"I know this is a critically acclaimed book, a Pulitzer winner, and a book tackling a difficult and complex stain on America history: slavery and black slave owners. There are moments when the book does say some interesting things or reveal some unsavory and uncomfortable truths, but it was so hard to engage with as a reader. I mean, I hung in with DFW through the first 600 pages of Infinite Jest where nothing happens -- but because I was fascinated by Hal, Orin, Marathe, Steeply, and Mario and Madame Psychosis who all fascinated me. There were literally dozens of other characters but these all pulled me in. In The Known World, there are also dozens of characters but none that I grew any attachment too. It was as if the author Jones was using a hand-held camera and no stabilizer so that the images were jumpy and out of focus. It reminded me sometimes of how the world seems to my myopic eyes between taking off my glasses in the morning and putting in my contact lenses. The narration also highly annoyed me. All the parenthetical \"in 60 years so and so will do such as such\" were meaningless because I was given neither enough time nor enough detail to give a shit. Further, there is this reference to \"years later they would all turn into human torches in front of the dry foods store\", but no mention afterwards of to what this referred. But the most annoying bit was in using the Canadian journalist frame at about page 130 or so (which then only briefly appears in the narrative 200 pages later in a parenthetical throwaway comment, it is said that the journalist would never marry his heart's desire yet 3 pages later, they marry and that coming to talk to Fern that there was some incomprehensible stuff that happens off-screen that morning (also never adequately explained) and so she was not going to open up to the journalist and yet we still find her filling in details about Henry, Moses and Caledonia 30 pages later. Too much inconsistency - was the editor asleep or stoned and missed these? So, despite taking on a complex subject, Jones is no Faulkner as his South does not eve approach that of the Great William. He is not as good as Pynchon or DFW is manipulating time and space in a narrative that was 100 or 150 pages too long and felt it, and he is not Alice Walker or Toni Morrison who brought us the most amazing, poignant, and powerful images of slavery and its residual impacts generations later that I have ever read. So, read Beloved or Absalom, Absalom if you want to hear about the South and I expect you will be less frustrated, but every bit enraged at this deplorable institution that is a cancer on the American past."

        "text":"Ambitious, Interesting, Disorganized In an interview, Edward P. Jones revealed that The Known World took shape around 1) when he heard that Black people had owned slaves and 2) when he read a thin paperback in high school about a Jewish man who decided to join the Nazi party, how he acted in opposition to how one would expect. The Known World is an ambitious novel which aims to describe the world of 1855 where Henry Townsend has recently died. As a result of his death, a cloud of uncertainty hangs in the air as he leaves behind his widow, Caldonia, and the undetermined fate of the slaves he purchased to work his land. Although the plot is interesting, this book is disorganized. It covers many different characters and rapidly shifts time periods. I would be reading along and then the text would say “and this person lived to be 93 years old and had 235 grandchildren.” (paraphrasing) Countless times, I had to stop and reread because the storytelling was so clunky. In The Known World, there are quite a few references to Adam and Eve, even references to Milton (Paradise Lost). My favorite author, Philip Pullman, loves to talk about this topic and how in his works he wanted his characters to find their way back to The Garden by taking the long way around. So this quote on page 329 stood out: “There was a long way around but he chose not to take it.” There is a character in The Known World by the name of Anderson Frazier. He creates and distributes pamphlets and interviews Fern Elston. In my opinion, this pamphlet could have provided a framework to systematically organize the characters instead of the resulting jumbled and confusing soup of characters and timelines. The Known World has some unforgettable moments, but the organization of the narrative reduces the enjoyment of the reading experience.

        "text":"This is a complex novel, with dense writing, a non-linear structure, and an abundance of characters. It reads much like a true historical account of a place, Manchester County, Virginia, and time, pre-Civil War 1800s. This could very nearly have passed for a non-fiction book; each character feels so real, their personal stories and histories so authentic. The author even goes so far as to tell us what happens to many of them ten, twenty or even fifty years in the future. And yet, Edward P. Jones himself states: \"The county and town of Manchester, Virginia, and every human being in those places, are products of my imagination… The census records I made up for Manchester were, again, simply to make the reader feel that the town and the county and the people lived and breathed in central Virginia once upon a time…\" Well, consider me duped. At first I really thought such a county existed and the data presented were genuine facts. As my son passed through the living room, I even shouted out some sort of statistic or another and asked if he had ever read about such a thing in his history classes. He couldn’t recall, but it sounded ‘familiar’. Right, because much of this could have been true, yet it wasn’t. The institution of slavery of course was all too real and cruel, and that’s what this book is about, and this is the truth. Slavery in all its forms is evil. Henry Townsend is a black farmer. He is a former slave that with the purchase of freedom and some land becomes a slave owner himself. Henry and his wife Caldonia own a small plantation near the border of his former master’s much larger one. I could not wrap my head around why on earth a freed man would ever want to enslave another human being. Henry and other black slave owners like him justify their actions: \"Henry had always said that he wanted to be a better master than any white man he had ever known. He did not understand that the kind of world he wanted to create was doomed before he had even spoken the first syllable of the word master.\" Well, as the old saying goes, ‘the road to hell is paved with good intentions.’ When Henry dies, all hell breaks loose, and we begin to see the ill-fated consequences of an institution that is immoral and corrupt. A narrative that seems to jump around in time and between characters eventually comes together into a whole as consequences and events snowball out of control. Lives are permanently changed. Some for the worst, others (we hope) for the better. They all become woven together much like the massive tapestry hanging on the wall of another place in another time. Each is part of the story. Everyone is responsible for the events which passed, were allowed to pass despite the huge injustice to humanity. This book is not easy to read. The structure is challenging and the topic is gloomy, albeit important. What happens to the people we grow to care for is often horrifying and heartbreaking. But it is well-written and extremely impactful. An important novel which is well worth your time and attention if you are up for the challenge. It won't suit everyone, but if you are at all interested, I encourage you to pick this one up. \"What I feared most at that moment is what I still fear: that they would remember my history, that I, no matter what I had always said to the contrary, owned people of our Race.\""

I'd read you, you'd provide enlightenment or emotional catharsis or entertainment, maybe even all three. All the signs were there: the laudatory quotes on your jacket, a shocking and unexpected premise, high marks on goodreads. But something was just off by the end of the first chapter. Maybe it was the masturbation scene right at the start. Or the characters that I just couldn't get into - I could hardly tell some of them apart. Or the way the narrative seemed to skip all over without any focus. Maybe I just didn't give you enough pages. I'm sure you got better as you went along. I mean, look at all the four- and five-star reviews you've gotten! But every time I picked you up my thoughts turned to the three other books on my bedside table that I'd rather be reading.

        "text":"There’s irony that I read more than half of this wrenching, ugly, hopeful, stirring, and grievous book while holding a sleeping baby in my arms. Because there is a lot of life and death in this take on pre-Civil War Virginia. I knew little about the book except that the author wrote it after reading about freed Black folks owning slaves. In delving into this issue, which in any modern conversation circle must bring dissonance, disbelief, and maybe even disgust, I became increasingly moved and disturbed. A difficult book, both because it’s an unflinching look at slavery, but also because it’s written in a James Joyce-ish style — lots of asides and stream of consciousness text. The author careens from generation to generation and back again in often the same paragraph. Yet it worked for me. It reads like a memoir of an entire county’s 150-year history complete with dozens of families represented. What results is simply, UNFORGETTABLE. There are characters whose faces I imagined while reading and characters whose stories I became invested in that will haunt me. Not in the truth of a fictional characterization but more because the ugliness of humanity was so blatantly on display and sadly remains real to this day. As I bid farewell to the slaves, slaveowners, children of both and ministers, sheriffs and patrollers of this novel, I will not forget their names. And I can’t help but wonder who would I have been in Manchester County, Virginia? (Reviewed 2\/12\/25)"

        "text":"I'm going to have to rave a bit, because this is one of the best books I've read in the past ten years. Jones packs in all the historical detail you could want, and of course he's hit on a subject--black slaveowners--that in and of itself is tabloid-sensational. Where lesser writers might lean too hard on the sensational aspect (or rely on it to bolster an otherwise weak narrative), Jones works it into a compelling and powerful story. What makes it so powerful is a mix of fascinating characters who are woven into a series of overlapping plotlines. For me it's the structuring that is so brilliant (geek alert: I actually diagrammed the time shifts in the chapters as an exercise, to see when and how Jones yoked the whole thing together). This less than linear approach might be frustrating to those who just want things to be straightforward, but stick with it: the shifts provide suspense as well as texture, and they propel more than one storyline at once. They do all come together, trust me. I also admire the overarching authorial voice in the novel, which certainly leans toward the formal, but also comes across as aware of the history it's grappling with: here and there Jones projects his voice forward for a moment, or seemingly digresses with factual material and research. Again it's all part of the tapestry and the mix, and I also think that the level of narrative awareness (which never disengages long enough to derail anything) adds another layer to the very idea of history--making the whole historical and contemporary both. And for those of you who can do without all of the above writerly blather (a thousand pardons), you'll find in this book characters who are engaging, ignorant, cruel, earnest, sympathetic, tragic, hopeful, flawed--in short, complicated. Halfway through you'll be fighting off the impulse to skip ahead to learn everyone's fate. Finally, I'll say that this book isn't perfect--there are aspects of what I've described above that sometimes don't work: narrative turns that do seem pointless digressions, a character or two a bit stereotypical or annoying. No matter. This book aims high, as brilliant works of art do, and the result is nothing short of amazing."

        "text":"This book demands that you read it slowly and intently. Like eating a huge Thanksgiving dinner, you need to pause and digest before you have the next course. At the outset, the plot seems to be all over the place, bouncing from character to character, telling too many stories, not telling enough and then seeming to tell too much. Ah, but then, you make a little progress and the rhythm begins to assert itself, the stories begin to weave together, the minute details begin to become a diorama, the picture stops being a blur and comes into sharp focus. This isn’t one man’s story, or even the story of one place, this is the story of all men and this is the tale of a world. This book is not so much about race as it is about the abject insanity and evil of the institution of slavery, wherever it is found, whoever is practicing it. In this system, there are free black masters holding black slaves, some of them well-meaning, but it does not make the practice any less immoral. There are white men who love their black mistresses and the children they bear, but it does not remove the fact that they hold a dominion over them that is not borne of love in any of its guises. There are also individuals who are victims of the system and others who refuse to be victims of the system, even at the cost of their lives. I loved many of Jones’ characters, notably Augustus and Mildred Townsend. They exemplify what is the best in us. I felt sorry for some of them, like Sheriff John Skiffington, who would like to be better than this society allows him to be, and Caldonia Townsend’s brother, Calvin, who wishes to go to New York so that he will not have to bear witness to the cruelties around him, cruelties he must realized have escaped him only because of a trick of fortune. I despised some of them, and I recognized most of them. The petty and jealous, who must have dominion over someone to feel they have worth; the ungrateful and traitorous, who would turn upon a friend to put some silver in their own pockets; the meek and hopeless, who bow to the yoke and try simply to find a corner in which they are allowed to exist; the defiant and strong-minded, who fight with their last breath because to do otherwise is to prop up the indefensible; all are here. What I loved most about this novel is its genuineness, its lack of exaggeration or hyperbole, where surely none is needed, its emphasis on the day-to-day injustice of an institution that is accepted as insurmountable or even correct only because it is what is. Edward P. Jones has leveled an attack at the heart of mankind and defied one to imagine what they would have done, what they would have dared to do, in such a place and time."

        "text":"A very complex and beautiful, compelling book about Henry, a former slave who becomes a slave owner, & his wife Caldonia. But they're just the start - the book is really a series of stories & vignettes about the families, friends, neighbors & community surrounding Henry & Caldonia. It took me a really long time to get into the book, because there are so many characters, some important & some not, & the book jumps around in time, making it difficult to follow. Trust me, use the cast of characters at the end of this edition (why not place this at the beginning?!) & give up your expectations about traditional narrative format, & you'll LOVE this book as much as I did. In life, we have our own story kind of playing in our head, & at the same time we have all these other stories we're hearing - the story about your mother's great-uncle. The story about your brother in law's neighbor. The one about your sister's husband's aunt & her neighbor. the one about your coworker's mother. You know all those stories? That's what this book is like - some characters are more important than others, so you hear more of their stories, but minor characters have stories too, & they sort of appear out of nowhere, & you get to hear their story, & then they're gone. It's really very cool! I particularly loved the story of the womanizing slave who has a vision during a lightning storm\/tornado - & becomes the founder of an orphanage. And the little tiny story about the family who don't want to give up their cow, & the woman goes into the barn to milk the cow & there's this lovely description of her squirting the cow's milk into a cat's mouth, & if you've ever seen a cat eat with true contentment you will recognize the cat body language that Jones describes. Toward the end of the book there's a very powerful scene where a character, who isn't a particularly \"good\" character, says there should be a lantern or light of truth in the world, an actual place where people can stand & tell the truth without fear of retribution, where one might be able to right a wrong. It's a moment where you think, yes this guy could right the wrong by speaking out, because his fear of having people think he's \"on the negro's side\" is...well, wrong! But that's his fear & in that moment of the book you understand it & you think, yeah, what if he could speak out under that light of truth & not have anyone judge him? How wonderful would that be? While the book depicts the horrors of slavery, & there are a few characters who are outright despicable, there are many shades of gray in Jones' vision as well. It's a book that will make you think about slavery, the myths & realities & tragedies of it all, & on top of that it'll make you think about your own life & all the people you've known & how complex & interesting we all are, really. It's beautifully written & the characters will stick in your head as if you'd known them too. Oddly, I think what I initially disliked most about this book - its multitude of characters & convoluted timeline - is what I ended up really enjoying! Another example of a book that made my head expand, with some creakiness, but I'm glad the expansion can still happen!"

        "text":"In this book I learned that there used to be black slaveholders in the US. I thought that only white people were allowed to own slaves during the time that owning slaves were like owning properties. During that pre-Abolition time. During those sad dark days in the American history. Black Edward P. Jones (born 1951) wrote this historical epic novel, The Known World based on the not well known fact that there were some black slaveholders (black people owning black slaves) in the state of Virginia during the time in the US when owning slave is legal. Wikipedia has this to say: \"Slavery in the United States was a form of unfree labor which existed as a legal institution in North America for more than a century before the founding of the United States in 1776, and continued mostly in the South until the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution in 1865.[1] The first English colony in North America, Virginia, first imported Africans in 1619, a practice earlier established in the Spanish colonies as early as the 1560s.[2] Most slaves were black and were held by whites, although some Native Americans and free blacks also held slaves; there were a small number of white slaves as well.[3]\" Winner of the 2004 Pulitzer Award for Fiction, The Known World is one of the most memorable reads I had this year. It is not an easy book to read. This 388-page novel left me with a heavy chest each time I closed the book. Each page is gloomy and sad. The novel is well-told with lyrical prose creating a big canvas of imagery in one's mind while reading. In that big canvas are memorable and three-dimensional numerous characters most of them black slaves. No character is downright bad or good. The detailed description of the sceneries of a fictional county called Manchester and the true depictions of the characters are exceptionally striking that I had to slow down in my reading to savor the story and hold on *tugging to them, cheering them on* to each characters. Reading the last page left me with a heavy heart. I would not want to let go of that image of Manchester and say goodbye Please don't go yet to the characters that I already became part of my literary world. The world that resides in the recesses of my brain. The world that is known only to me populated by people who I met only in my readings. In terms of writing, Jones extensively use the technique called prolepsis that I first encountered reading Muriel Sparks' The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie (1961). Jones explained this in the interview (appendix of the book) saying that he is the God of those characters so he knows what happened in the life of each characters from the time he\/she was born up to the time his\/her death. The most moving example of this use was with the character of the child Tessie . One fine day of September 1855, their mistress Caldonia saw the 5-y\/o Tessie playing with a wooden toy horse. Caldonia says to the child: That is very nice, Tessie to which Tessie responded, My papa did this for me . In January 2002, on her deathbed, the old Tessie asked her caretaker to get the wooden toy horse from the attic. While holding the toy, she breathed her last saying the same thing: My papa did this for me . My heart stopped beating. Tears welled up in my eyes. That scene is just one of the many moving scenes about those slaves in that time of the history in Virginia when black people were traded like they were not human but properties. I can make this review very long. There are just too many good things I would like to say here but I am afraid that no review can make justice to a book as good as this."

Free blacks owned other black people. Some free blacks bought their family members and others just wanted the slave labor. Native Americans owned slaves for much of the same reasons. The Known World introduces us to some of those people. The Known World has won a whole gang of awards, so we know its an important book and the writing is top notch. My only problems with the book were the fact that there were too many characters. You know this is a pet peeve of mine and I lost track of all the characters in this book. My other problem was that it jumped backwards and forwards in time way too much. Most of the time jumps were super confusing. I liked The Known World but I think I might not be smart enough to read this book. I'll probably reread it sometime in the future and I do recommend to others because its a brilliant book."

However, any plot that might exist was buried so deep beneath the convoluted chronology and extraneous characters and details that I decided I didn't care to keep digging for it, and quit on page 198. The author seemed determined to insert every existing anecdote about slavery into one novel. This might have worked better as a compilation of essays or short stories."

While I was reading, I kept on going \"what did I just read? Am I really reading\/understanding this book?\" and kept on referring to the back cover of the book. No. The story was simply what I read. O.......K! Then ugh. I HATE leaving a book unread, so I kept on forcing myself to read thru the whole book. Finally the misery I was putting myself through ended, and UGH! The storyline. The author kept on jumping around the timeline too much - and honestly - I would describe this book as a glimpse of the lives of slaves in the south, but with a blah storyline. However this book has won a pultizer prize. EH!? Anyone out there who has read this book? Your opinions?? However like always, we learn from books. What I got out of this book was a new knowledge I never came upon, that black people owned black slaves.They even buy their own family members, and the slaves were considered as properties, including family. Hmm... History is richier than we will ever know or think of."

        "text":"The Known World does this weird thing: it cites its sources. And it's weird because they don't exist. There are passages like this: [Manchester, VA] went through a period of years and years of what University of Virginia historian Roberta Murphy in a 1948 book would call 'peace and prosperity'. Jones goes on to tell you the publication history of that book, and a few more things about what was in it, and to imply that Roberta Murphy was a little racist. But there is no Roberta Murphy, there is no book, there is no Manchester, VA. What is Jones up to? Wyatt Mason notes : What research on the subject Jones undertook was, in fact, quickly derailed after he happened upon an account of a white slave owner who spent her days abusing one of her black slaves, a little girl, by beating her head against a wall. “If I had wanted to tell the whole story of slavery, Americans couldn’t have taken that,” Jones told an interviewer. “People want to think that there was slavery, and then we got beyond it. People don’t want to hear that a woman would take a child and bang her head against the wall day after day. It’s nice that I didn’t read all those books. What I would have had to put down is far, far harsher and bleaker. Too much of a bummer? It's not that The Known World is a feel-good novel. Ears and Achilles tendons will be sliced. It follows the rules of slavery books: slave narratives always had happy endings; later, fictional slave narratives always have sad endings. But Toni Morrison has a different opinion about what Americans can and can't take. Shit, so does Harriet Jacobs. And Jones knows this, so he's being disingenuous. And you notice that he's talking about books he didn't actually read. NPR says, Jones collected two shelves of books about slavery, but never got around to reading them. Still, the author was able to use his imagination, and stories he had heard growing up, to make his characters come alive. \"I decided the people I'd created were real enough and I had just accumulated enough information about what the world was like in the South before 1865 to allow me to lie and get away with it,\" he says. Look, I don't mean to say Jones isn't telling the truth. I don't know if he is, and neither does he; neither of us read those two shelves of books about slavery. But the citation of imaginary sources in the book itself serves to either add authenticity that's undeserved, or - if you follow up on those sources - underline its lack of authenticity. I'm puzzled by it. This sort of meta-sourcing has been done before - by Nabokov in Pale Fire, by Cervantes, and in its closest parallel by Borges in his first collection, Universal History of Iniquity, which also confused me. It's especially jarring here, maybe just because I find the truth of slavery a fraught subject, and maybe because the layers go so deep - even in interviews about his lack of authenticity, he appears to be consciously inauthentic. I don't know, man, I don't get it. But anyway: is it a good made-up story about made-up people? Yeah, sure, totally. Eventually. The first half is a little annoying. There's a lot of chronological foofarah - skipping all over the place for no pressing reason - and a ginormous cast it's hard to keep track of, and our super-omniscient narrator often takes time out to tell you some trivial character's entire life story, which you didn't really need. But the second half ratchets up the tension to pure shit-your-pantsville, as that sprawling cast all meet their assorted fates. It makes up for some irritation in the first half. So yeah, as a novel it's excellent. The authenticity issue, I bring up mostly because we take this book seriously; it won a Pulitzer. It deserves to be looked carefully at. I looked carefully and I was confused by its truth."

        "text":"Despite some luminous moments where the characters come alive in a special way, this novel about the lives of slaves in a fictional community in Virginia of the 1830s felt too hermetic and sealed off for me to enjoy it as thoroughly as others might. The special hook that the story holds is its rendering of freed blacks who became slave owners themselves. The focus is on one such plantation with about 30 slaves which is struggling to adapt to the death of its black master, Henry Townsend. We get a plausible history along the way of how his father, Augustus, was so talented at furniture making that he bought his own freedom, and state legislative action allowed him to continue residing in the state and eventually bought the freedom of his son. With other free blacks, such as the feisty, condescending teacher Fern, who came from the North, they form a small society of their own. While Augustus abhors slavery, his son tries to emulate the path taken by the whites to economic success by owning slaves. Despite an ambition to become a benevolent master, the corrupting influence of owning people as property is well portrayed. When his lonely widow takes up a love relationship with her plantation foreman, she is replicating the same abuse of power enacted by most other white plantation owners, and the consequences are tragic. The “known world” of plantation life in this fictional county is like an island in time, and the characters themselves seem stuck in it like insects in amber. The omniscient narrator is god-like in passing into the thoughts and dreams of more than a dozen characters. Unfortunately, the reader gets distanced from emotionally connecting to them by the narrator breaking the flow to leap backward and forward in time to reveal some particular fact or person’s fate (for more see: D.D. Wood review ). Ultimately, the human bonds holding people to each other came off as tenuous and unreal as beholding a ship in a bottle. Unlike the romanticized lives portrayed in Hailey’s “Roots”, the characters have no sense of cultural history of their African origins (the word itself appears nowhere in the book), and there is no foreshadowing of plantation life as a doomed phase in history on the path to the Civil War. The idea of a slave revolt is unthinkable, and the one humane white character, Sheriff Skiffington, feels no compunction over diligently carrying out a big part of his job in organizing night patrols and retrieval efforts when “property” runs away. Though we get no sense of the reality of the “Underground Railroad”, we do get a brilliant vision at one point where Augustus ends up mailing a slave girl to Philadelphia in a crate along with a shipment of his hand-carved walking sticks. In an interview with Jones appended to the audiobook version of the novel, he admits he did not do much research for the book and was not concerned about communicating any particular message to his readers about the history of slavery. As the creator of all the characters, he would not admit to favoring any one character over another. Still the reader can’t help but getting the message of how inhumane slavery was and how individuals trapped in it strived to achieve some form of dignity in their lives. Like other reviewers, I didn’t feel I got to know any of the characters well enough to get emotionally engaged with them. When not interrupted by invasions from the narrator, the prose is effective in evoking the place and time, an obvious factor in helping it gain a Pulitzer Prize. Here is a lovely example from the opening for the book: The evening his master dies he worked again well after he ended the day for the other adults, his own wife among them, and sent them back with hunger and tiredness to their cabins. The young ones, his son among them, had been sent out of the fields an hour or so before the adults, to prepare the late supper and, if there was time enough, to play in a few minutes of sun that were left. When he, Moses, finally freed himself of the ancient and brittle harness that connected him to the oldest mule his master owned, all that was left of the sun was a five-inch long memory of red orange laid out in still waves across the horizon between two mountains on the left and one on the right. He had been in the fields for all of fourteen hours. He paused before leaving the fields as the evening quiet wrapped itself about him. The mule quivered, wanting home and rest. Moses closed his eyes and bent down and took a pinch of the soil and ate it with no more thought than if it were a spot of cornbread. …he ate it not only to discover the strengths and weaknesses of the field, but because eating it tied him to the only thing in his small world that meant almost as much as his own life."

        "text":"Glorious account that gets past cliches. The premise is that two slaves in 1840s Virginia bought their freedom, but their son stayed a little too long under the master's care. What does the family do when the son starts his own farm and buys his own slaves? The mastery of Jones' writing comes in the sense of history that he lends to minute objects, chance encounters, and incantatory reveries within a frought landscape. Not content to write an unwritten history of forgotten people, Jones re-writes the histories that have been written, citing documents the purport to explain the historical phenomenon of free blacks who owned slaves. Passages that carry runaway characters to the north also tie in academic treatises from the next century, deeds and warrants and court decisions that attempted to justify white supremacy, and the momentoes that emancipated children carry to their deathbeds. Jones doesn't neglect to include tales of individual transformation, collective redemption, or international implications in this epic. Characters may come and go like fleeting ghosts, yet the marks they leave may remain. When the words of the plantation master and deeds of the escaped overseer have faded into ineffectual memory, we readers are left with both the sense that an institution has gone horribly wrong and that the people within it can be honorably right; even if the results remain unapparent, the promise of future change remains, along with the threat of complacency and neglect. Jones didn't attempt to detail the national debate over slavery that was current at that time. That limitation on his project was probably a good one. It allows us to see the human effects that rhetoric had covered, and allowed him to devote his attentions to demonstrating the range of positions that people could occupy in relation to the institution. Yes, whether you're descended from a slave, a master, a freed man, a black woman passing as white, an unwilling overseer, a treacherous deputy, a conscientious drunk, or an immigrant Irishwoman sold into prostitution, there's something in this book for you - and I wish that I was only joking, but the irony is that there is no irony here, and sincerity is the least of what we have to do, and memory is only the start of making a history that hasn't stopped."

        "text":"Set in antebellum Virginia, a former slave, Henry Townsend, owns fifty acres of land and thirty-three slaves. As the story opens, Townsend is dying. The novel chronicles his life, the lives of his family members, and the lives of people he encountered in the community. The main characters are three-dimensional and feel like real people, with both admirable traits and flaws. Jones employs an omniscient narrator and non-linear storytelling. He weaves together overlapping stories of past and present events, such that the reader knows what happens to these people in the future before knowing what has happened to them in the book’s “present.” There are a great many characters in this book and the list of Dramatis Personae is helpful in keeping them all straight. This novel is based on a lesser known historical fact. While it was not common, it did happen that some free blacks owned slaves. It lends a complexity to the slavery narrative – showing how people can be impacted by society’s strictures and how victims of exploitation could become perpetrators of the same system. This is not a quick and easy read. It feels like being immersed in the life and times of Manchester County, Virginia, in the 1850s. It is an eloquently written condemnation of oppression in any form. This book won the Pulitzer Prize in 2004."

(i know, i know. this is fiction. a novel. get over it. but it was just kinda weird to me. social commentary inserted into fiction happens. steinbeck did it. teju cole does it. many writers do this. i felt like jones did a crap-ton of research for this book. but then i read this NPR piece . in it, he notes he collected 2 shelves worth of books on slavery... \"but never got around to reading them\" . so this just added to my 'what the?' on the references in the novel and jones' research.) * all of this combined for a really awkward flow, and convoluted storytelling. i felt like it could lose 50-100 pages and be a tighter, better story. in case you think maybe i am a lazy reader - i'm not, i swear! i love nothing more than a meaty, tough read. jones' story is definitely both of these things. he explores the issue of free black people owning slaves in virginia, and he gives us a large cast of active characters. but it all felt so... surface-y. we get the actions and reactions, but we don't really get the motivations or emotions. jones is navigating a morally dodgy landscape, one i would have loved to have gone into more deeply. we are given the horrors and the heartbreaks, but it all felt so detached. and, you know, maybe that is totally on purpose. maybe, for some people, detachment is the only way through such a horrible time in history. jones has collected some serious critical acclaim and recognition over his career. to name a few: he's won the pulitzer, the national book critic's circle award, the PEN\/Hemingway award, a MacArthur genius grant, and the International IMPAC dublin literary award. he's won nearly $1 million in literary awards alone. the man knows what he's doing, and the respect he's earned is fairly universal. the known world is an important story. but is just shining the light on the issues jones raises enough? so now i am back to the should . i should love this book. (it was just okay for me.) people should read this book. (indeed. but this is not a book i will blanket recommend to all.) so, i don't know you guys. i am bummed over this one. and this is a terrible review\/collection of thoughts. maybe i'll become more coherent with some distance and fix this up a bit - but for now i wanted to note down something here. (aside #1 (going to be a bit spoiler-y here): moses confused me. or, rather, his turn to all-of-a-sudden being an asshole was weird. we're going along with moses. he seems like a lovely man. then, halfway into the book, he's a wife-beater, jerkface? where did that come from, and why was he presented like that? the reveal of moses being a not nice man was sudden and odd.) (aside #2: worth noting (was hugely interesting to me) - the cover photo of this edition is © Eudora Welty ! i had no idea about her photographic prowess .)"

On top of that, the book has won all sorts of prizes: *Pulitzer Prize for Fiction (2004) *International Dublin Literary Award (2005) *Anisfield-Wolf Book Award (2004) *National Book Critics Circle Award for Fiction (2003) * Hurston\/Wright Legacy Award Nominee for Debut Fiction (\/2004 *National Book Award Finalist for Fiction (2003) I knew I had to give it a try. I am glad I have read it, but to say I like it, would just not be true. It’s OK, so I am giving it two stars. There is no real central character to the story, because he dies right off the bat. It is 1855 when Henry Townsend dies. He is black. He had been a slave, but his parents had bought him his freedom. He leaves behind no children but a wife, Caldonia, a twenty-eight-year-old educated black woman born free, and his property of thirty-three slaves and fifty acres in Manchester County, Virginia. The book is about the hell that breaks loose afterwards, but really what it is about is life in the South during the antebellum era, about the mindset of Blacks and Whites of this era. The story is told by an omniscient narrator—who knows how each character thinks, what has happened to all of them in the past and what will happen to all of them in the future. It is this all-seeing narrator that shapes the entire feel of the story. This narrator knows everything, but he is not particularly adept at cogently telling a story. In one sentence you may switch form the present to the future and back again. In the next sentence you flip back to the past. It is easy to become confused. Character upon character is thrown at you, with little tidbits about their lives in the past, present and future. You are given an entire community of individuals—Whites and Blacks, a Native American or two, those who are free and those who are slaves, a sheriff and his deputy. The omniscient narrator is constantly restating who each one is, which is good in one sense, but the flow of the tale becomes jerky. Stop and start, backward and forward and often confusing. Use of the omniscient narrator is pushed to the extreme. It is kind of nice to have a character or two to guide you through a story. You do not have that here. There are a whole group of characters, characters that are hard to attach yourself to. You do not get close to any one individual. In the afterword the author points out that he wanted to draw characters that were neither all good nor all bad, each one different in their own way. You do get that here, but you fail to feel anything for any of them. What you do get is a strong sense of being one of a large community. You are there, one among many, living in the antebellum South. This does give one a hands-on feeling of life then and there and how people were thinking. Kevin Free narrates the audiobook. It is simple to follow, the speed is fine and he intonations are well done. The narration performance is good so I have given the narration three stars."

I don't remember which book I suggested then, but I recall one woman in particular who really loved this book (or I believe she was more in love with Edward Jones' writing). At the end of the workshop we had a gift exchange raffle and she included this book as her contribution. I was the lucky recipient of this free copy. I was interested in this historical novel set in a fictional place in Virginia during the antebellum era, about a former slave who ends up owning slaves. The strangeness of the story and the angle it takes as a slave narrative is intriguing. Also appealing is the way the omniscient narration allows the reader to approach the story without the moral judgement one reserves for this kind of story, since the distance of the narration allows one to realize quickly what the story tries to showcase: how slavery has already poisoned the integrity of all involved. The framework of the novel is composed of anecdotal stories within stories, with pacing often interrupted for a mini scene or two, or an introduction of yet another character who may reappear later or simply disappear. Put another way, it is a book of puzzle pieces: one is added, taken away, another picked up, oh yes, there's the whole, whoops, maybe not, here goes another piece. So although I admired the writing and story setup in the beginning, I just was not in the right space to complete this novel. It has been a while since I added a book to my \"did-not-finish\" list; alas, this one has just made the list. This is not a failed attempt at reading this novel, however, because I remember not being able to finish Ngugi wa Thiong'o's Wizard of the Crow only to later fall in love with his novel, Petals of Blood .

While not exactly removing race from the issue of slavery, Jones is able to show that even among African-Americans the perniciousness of slavery could damn a generation. The best summary of this idea came from a NYTimes review: 'There are few certified villains in this novel, white or black, because slavery poisons moral judgments at the root. As Jones shows, slavery corrupts good intentions and underwrites bad ones, yet allows decency the odd occasion -- but only by creating such an enormous need for it.' The pacing and structure of this novel could be a little challenging to some, but I found that it fit the narrative perfectly. This isn't a novel that burns you with its quotable sentences, but it scars you with its images. There were periods in it where I thought I was reading a Cormac McCarthy novel.

        "text":"When Toni Morrison began her research for \"Beloved,\" she discovered a trove of ghastly instruments. She knew, of course, that slaves were routinely whipped, starved, raped, and hanged, but the existence of specially forged tools was a surprise: metal bits forced down the throat, iron masks locked across the face, spiked collars clasped around the neck. Her Pulitzer Prize-winning novel reintroduced those horrors into the national memory and did much to demonstrate that the cruelties of slavery extended far beyond hard labor and physical deprivation. \"The Known World,\" by Edward Jones, reclaims another peculiarity of American slavery and in the process illustrates yet again that we can't under- estimate its perverse contortions of the human spirit. Bizarre as it sounds, in Louisiana, Virginia, and South Carolina, a small number of free blacks owned their own plantations - and their own slaves. It was a precarious arrangement, to be sure. Blacks who were freed or managed to buy their own freedom had little incentive to tarry in the South. The laws governing their status and their right to hold property were ambiguous and easy for any white person to shred. Jones uses this fragile situation as the setting for a novel about a group of black and white Virginians who tried - sometimes nobly, often viciously - to maintain their world in the face of inevitable collapse. To the extent that Morrison spun a surreal tale of American slavery into mythic proportions, Jones has carved a companion series of stark anecdotes into national legends. In a measured voice that never rises to reflect the agonies and absurdities he describes, he moves back and forth through decades and across state lines, assembling an apparently random collection of brief scenes that gradually fuse into a stunning portrait of moral confusion. The story revolves around Henry Townsend, a black man who, with the indulgence of his former owner, managed to buy his own farm and his own slaves - eventually 29 adults and a collection of children. Henry's parents, who labored tirelessly to free him as a child, are horrified by his participation in the flesh market, but Henry is ambitious, and, what's more, he learned from his master that \"once you own even one, you will never be alone.\" As a protection against loneliness and a way to wealth, Henry can't imagine anything more successful, and he's convinced he can be \"a better master than any white man he had ever known.\" Indeed, he attains that dubious goal, creating a plantation with forced labor that's largely free of physical beatings, but it's an insidious gentility that only camouflages the humiliations of Southern slavery. Nevertheless, his untimely death frightens most of his slaves, who know just how delicate their relative comfort is. Only the brooding overseer, Moses, the first slave Henry ever bought, sees his master's demise as an opportunity - not for freedom, but for taking his place. Indeed, what interests Jones most in this complex novel is the way slavery distorts judgment, not just of those who oppress, but of those who are oppressed. Henry's widow, Caldonia, quickly decides against freeing \"her legacy,\" choosing instead to maintain the plantation in the spirit of Henry's gentle example. \"Her husband had done the best he could,\" she thinks, \"and on Judgment Day his slaves would stand before God and testify to that fact.\" Occasionally, a child is worked to death or a pregnant woman labors in the field till she miscarries, but Caldonia sheds sincere tears, comforts the parents, and considers whether she should buy insurance against further losses of her property. As a single woman with a large business to run, she's encouraged by a collection of family and friends, other free blacks, some of whom own their own slaves, too. One of the most troubling is Fern, Caldonia's prim teacher of literature and etiquette. Together, they keep the irony of their position well buried, while socializing in a kind of racial terrarium maintained by William Robbins, the county's wealthiest white farmer. Estranged from his own wife but protected by his political power, he loves a black woman in town and openly adores his two mulatto children. The Townsend plantation with its little coterie of free slave-owning blacks gives his favorites a place to play and refine themselves. In one of several shifts to the late 19th century, a Canadian historian interviews Fern, Caldonia's teacher, about those days on the plantation. \"All of us do only what the law and God tell us we can do,\" she says without any hint of guilt or remorse. \"We owned slaves. It was what was done, and so that is what we did.\" Jones uses that same tone of historical distance throughout, a tone that amplifies the grotesque mingling of affection and cruelty that infected these people, black and white. In the center of this moral kaleidoscope stands the sheriff, John Skiffington, an earnest Christian, dedicated to the objective application of law and convinced that \"the law always cares\" for everyone equally. It's a doomed endeavor, of course, but as Caldonia's plantation begins to collapse, Skiffington fails to realize that the legal system he's sworn to uphold is not objective and that he cannot remain clean within it. The scrambled collection of events and characters makes this a difficult story to enter, but that structure eventually accounts for much of the novel's evocative power. Jones has a kind of biblical style that suggests whole lives in a few stark details from a perspective that's alternately microscopic and telescopic. It's a technique that resists our efforts to keep these events in some unrecoverable past. The troubling implications of his story leach in through hairline cracks all over the twin shells of antebellum nostalgia and Northern piety. Every time Caldonia cheerfully reminds her friends, \"We are all worthy of one another,\" the legacy of slavery sounds more complex and unresolved. http:\/\/www.csmonitor.com\/2003\/0814\/p1..."

        "text":"Very good book. I have to admit while reading this book on slavery I felt a little ignorant. I never knew that free (former) slaves bought and owned slaves themselves. Just another thing that I did not learn in American history. This book had many characters but the characters were not overwhelming. The characters involve a man who worked hard to buy his freedom and eventually the freedom of his wife and later their child only to see their child prosper and purchase slaves for himself. The book also focuses on his slaves and their relationships. There is also the sheriff and his wife who are given a slave girl as a wedding gift even though they are against slavery they raise her and think of her as their \"child\" All of these stories come together in The Known World."

    "desc":"Warren Buffett once memorably described derivatives as \"financial weapons of mass destruction\". Read this sensational and controversial account of the often dazzling business of derivatives trading, and see if you agree. No money is ever really made in financial markets. Markets merely transfer wealth. As to how to make money? Well, it is basically theft, misrepresentation, lies, cheating, deception or force. It is impossible to make the staggering amounts made in derivatives in good years honestly. Traders, Guns & Money is a wry and wickedly comic exposé of the culture, games, and pure deceptions played out every day in trading rooms around the world, usually with other people's money. Whether you move in the financial world yourself, know people who do, or have money invested in stocks, shares or derivatives, this is a fascinating read guaranteed to make you think.",

        "text":"All but a few financial storytellers fall short in comparison with Michael Lewis. Satyajit Dasis is no exception. Like the others who failed, he was not Lewis-like enough to carry the narrative. On the plus side, I give Das credit for his clear explanations of the many derivative products that are out there today. Let’s award points, too, for his title, even though the book couldn’t quite live up to the humor it was meant to project. As for the shortcomings, the worst, I thought, was the short shrift he gave to the more human elements. Lewis can get you involved with the people – smart or naïve, honest or corrupt, successful or beaten to a pulp. You want to know what happens to them in the unfolding story. Your understanding is helped by the fact that whole messy business has been personalized. With Das, it’s more just a laundry list of the financial products and recycled press accounts of famous meltdowns. Whenever he does involve people, they’re either fictitious stick figures or categories of investment subspecies lumped together a little too conveniently into bins of disrepute. I’m sure he has a point when he says many of today’s financial instruments can postpone tax bills, shift risks to less savvy clients, and obfuscate product deliverables, but in my mind he overplayed his cynicism and lost credibility in the process. Not all M&A activity is cannibalism, not all derivatives were created to dupe someone, and not all people in the industry are crooked. He weakens his case when he implies as much."

        "text":"Das, a derivatives and risk expert, takes a very snarky look at these complex products that exploded the financial world in 2008 (though he is writing in 2006). Few people understand them, but whenever investors are flush with cash, money has to end up somewhere, and it's often seeking the highest return. The quants who create them may understand the equations, but not the real world consequences. The salespeople who sell them don't really understand them, and the buyers - in a system ruled by asymmetric information, where the seller always knows more than the buyer - rarely ever do. Although not as dull or abstruse as a textbook, which Das also writes, this book does go into the weeds, and readers who have no knowledge whatsoever of derivatives will find themselves floating on a sea of mysterious acronyms, coupled with diagrams and flow charts. Das keeps it punchy with chapterette headings such as \"Rough Trade,\" \"Bondage,\" \"Dukes of Hazard,\" and \"Tranche Warfare.\" He tells us that heading into a trial preparation as a plaintiff's expert witness, where an Indonesian noodle company that had been snookered on some derivatives was suing the issuer, he had looked up Portia's \"quality of mercy\" speech from The Merchant of Venice as a precaution. The book is plagued by typos: missing apostrophes and quotation marks, and astonishingly, a consistent misspelling of Warren Buffett's name. Former Salomon head John Gutfreund is repeatedly referred to as \"John Gutenfreund.\""

        "text":"And you thought a book on derivatives and option trading would be boring. WRONG! How can wiping out the global economy ever be boring? Oh sure, Option Trading is a wonky subject, and I’ve read many a dry book on the subject, but this one breaks the mold. It really does help you understand the mechanics of the derivative world as well as show you real world applications in a hilarious manner. Well, hilarious if you weren’t the one losing all your money in the deal. Or if somehow you weren’t part of the global economy within the last decade. Let me step back at this point. Options. Basically, they’re for farmers. You plant a crop, spend all year tending to it, and need to be certain of a profit. Rather than relying on the weather and gods, you enter a contract. You limit your maximum profit, but put a floor on the downside. The baker does the same… he needs to ensure the price of flour stays low enough to keep his business going down the line. He enters into a buy contract for the farmer’s goods. Simple enough. And sure, why not scale that concept into new industries as well? Think fuel costs for a transportation company… now you’re getting the idea. But here’s the thing. Why shouldn’t Wall Street take advantage of such a simple thing? I mean, little risk and profits from the sale of the contracts. How could these masters of the universe fuck that up? Just like everything else they touch, it’s gotta turn to gold for them. And that’s why this book shines. When you seriously get to the causes behind all the messes caused by these guys, you’ll laugh so hard that you’ll cry. Mostly because a little part of you died on the inside and you were already crying to begin with. But you’ll laugh too! Now, I work on the ass end of this machine, but I’m still an insider. The book made me look around my office and laugh. Then cry. You see, the formula is the same no matter where you go in this industry. A bunch of young know nothings running around selling crap that even their PhD financial quant engineers can’t understand. It’s perfect, the kids, most all who are in their 20s, peddle weapons of mass destruction to anyone dumb enough to buy their bomb. I see it every day at work. Kids ruining client’s people’s retirements because they’re just too stupid to…. Nah, wait, not stupid. They just don’t care. Either way, the stupid\/not caring allows them rack in major paychecks. Wealth is not created by the financial industry, it is simply moved about. Now you’re thinking, “Hey, great idea… let’s get smart people in there instead?” Wrong again, my friend. See, knowing ‘stuff’ in this industry is a bad thing. If you know stuff, you make the salesman feel bad about what they’re doing. This goes up the chain of command too. The author points out how management is based on hitting sales goals instead of skill or experience, because obviously this is a way to run the global economy. But it is. Sure, not everyone is horrid asshole when it comes to this industry, but we’ll never get far enough in this corporate climate to change things. Given the fact that this book was written pre Great Recession, one could almost say it serves as a witty warning of things to come. Too bad that I’m writing this follow up in 2014… because I can tell you first hand that nothing has changed. And it’s not the industries fault. It’s yours. Yep, you know that boring guy you ignored when you tried to talk finance…? Remember how you brought all your money over to the 20 year old who kept blowing smoke up your ass instead?"

(Zero coupon bond worth 106%, call option on my portfolio purchases, they keep a percentage for themselves.) I also learned that I was a sucker for buying into this annuity - except that I was lucky and did it a year before the market drop of 2008. Now if I can just get my 106% out... I was a big fan of Frank Portnoy's Fiasco and this is the geekier version with more finance than most people want to read. The author, Das, also includes stories of derivatives deals which drive home how outmatched most purchasers, no matter how sophisticated they think they are (Fortune 500 CFO's et al), compared to the folks who spend their entire days thinking of novel financial vehicles."

        "text":"A long walk for a medium sized drink that gets warm by the end. This is no Michael Lewis book, which is what I thing most readers desperately want it to be. The reader will be challenged which is good and bad. I have to admit this was one of the hardest books I've ever read as the material is pretty thick. The depth of the subject covered in this book not for a casual audience. I probably now know more than I'll ever want to about derivatives, and more than I probably should about the internal dealings of Wall Street. I agree with the Financial Times assessment from the cover that this is fascinating reading, but only for those who are deeply, deeply interested in the topic. I was pulled in by the title's inclusion of the word \"guns\" as I was hoping for a book similar to \"Confessions of an Economic Hit Man\" by John Perkins. I was looking for more adventure and explosions or something with at least hit of espionage, in fact I don't think a gun ever made an appearance, so I felt suckered by the title. This book really was closer to a text book study of derivatives or at least one man's life story of working in derivative markets on Wall Street, than anything having to do with guns. Though perhaps I just didn't go all in on the metaphor the author was trying to push on the reader. I prefer the analogy that derivatives are closer to WMD's, not guns. The book is a bit more interesting reading in 2015, as it was published in 2006 before the big crash. The author makes many points that you cringe reading in hindsight about just how out of hand things had gotten during the era of his authorship. Many \"shame on us\" moments, but when has that ever stopped us (the American public) before, and doubtful it will stop us in the future. If you are the right audience for this, dive right in, other wise pass on by as it's going to be a long journey."

        "text":"I did learn a few things about derivatives from this book. For example, I had not previously realized how mark to market accounting can be used to inflate profits and traders' bonuses and can lead to margin calls on illiquid top level CDO tranches when the failure of lower tranches causes a ratings downgrade in upper level tranches that would probably actually pay full value if held to maturity, so even if the models were right in predicting tiny risks of default, the accounting rules helped to accelerate the financial crisis. The book does a good job in showing how derivatives can create an economic house of cards rather than having positive value in increasing liquidity and stability. But in trying to be light and humorous, the author frequently becomes too cynical and snarky. And he could have gone a bit deeper than he did in explaining the math and the modeling. Surely it can't all be as much of a shell game as the author suggests, or if it is, I wish that he would have given me a little more substance to reach that conclusion on my own."

I still stand by what I said about the book's tone -- from the punchy three-word title you could recognise it for the way it reads, sort of a stand up comic routine on the derivative markets. The first half wasn't especially compelling, as the castigation of financial professionals is so generalised. You have to be offensive to be funny, I guess. Once you get past that, the second half rocks -- perhaps because I don't take any personal offense, not being involved in derivatives. It's a great insider's view of how and why derivatives evolved, with great and simple (and cynical) explanations of why various structures were created (generally, to evade taxes, get around trading regulations, and other ways to give investors more yield and earn banks more fees). The anecdotes and narrative read like a late-night drink confessional -- probably exaggerated but sounding true enough in essence, and deeply educational. As mentioned previously, it doesn't claim to be a rigorous, comprehensive risk management textbook (which Das has written) so it won't be that sort of educational if that's what you're looking for. But through anecdotes it gives a sharp sense of the culture of the people involved, something you could never find even in very good textbooks."

It points out how most financial derivatives are just a sophisticated form of gambling but one where the house edge is often very unclear. You probably need a basic understanding of finance and derivatives to enjoy this book because it can get a little technical. I certainly learned a lot more about derivatives after reading this. Some chapters get a little repetitive but overall the book is really interesting. The examples of companies using derivatives to inflate their balances sheets or to comply with EU regulations before a merger just go to show how much craftiness and deception can come from the finance industry. A better title for this might be “everything you wanted to know about derivatives but were too afraid to ask”."

It is about a trader who worked in the British banking system and his attempt to defend an Indonesian company that blew itself up with derivatives and leverage. The fake names (Nero and Neverfail) that he gives people are just a little too ridiculous. Most of the math that he is trying to explain is excellent. Off-hand, the only numerical error I noticed in this book was a point where I am pretty sure that a number that was supposed to be $1,000 million was written as $1,000 billion. The book does explain things like derivatives and CDOs, but a lot of that went flying over my head. His cynical view of the fail states of various business practices described in either chapter 2 or chapter 3 were hilarious."

Some of these would make GREAT articles. Collectively, they do not make a good book or a good read. HOWEVER, the content, if you can slog through the books flaws, is excellent.

Nearly everything banking related that would go wrong in the great recession is talked about in this book, and that makes it an asset.

He wrote in the Preface, \"[This book] is the record of my time in the derivatives industry. It is a collection of tales about the products, the people and the strange goings-on in the business... There is almost no literature that explains the industry in an accessible way. There is also little that sets out the practices, some of which are insane, of this mysterious area of finance. [The book] explains the industry, how it operates and what it does. The book does not attempt to make a case for and against derivatives, it just shows what REALLY goes on every day in the dealing rooms in major financial centers, the real life dramas and rational madness that shape modern markets. [The book] is intended for two audiences. People in banking and finance ... will find it a wry and entertaining read... This book is also for those who want an accessible introduction to this weird and wonderful world. It will perhaps confirm their worst fears and prejudices about these strange instruments, what they are used for and the people who trade them.\" (Pg. xiii) He recalls, \"Many of today's traders hadn't been born when I stumbled accidently into derivatives trading. I had spent over 25 years in this world of traders, guns and money. The traders and money were clear enough. And you couldn't have financial weapons more powerful than derivatives---they were the big guns of the trade... How did I get there? I had followed the money... I had not known very much about derivatives when I started. How did I get here? ... This is that story. It is also coincidentally the story of the rise and rules of derivative trading---its 'knowns' and its 'unknowns.'\" (Pg. 18) He points out, \"The major defender of derivatives was Alan Greenspan, Chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York... The head of the central bank's role as cheerleader for the derivatives lobby was curious.\" (Pg. 20) He recalls, \"We needed 'innovation,' we were told. We created increasingly odd products. These obscure structures allowed us to earn higher margins than the cutthroat vanilla business... New structures that clients actually wanted were not that easy to create... The truth was that we weren't very creative but by golly, we were good at plagiarism. We chased our tails some more.\" (Pg. 41) Later, he adds, \"Survival requires keeping your head down. There was no point in resisting the latest fad. I just nodded and kept doing what I always did---trying to make money. No management fad lasted long. Before you know it, we would have a new 'business model' and would be entering a 'new paradigm.'\" (Pg. 74) He observes, \"Greenspan had been right---risk had truly been unbundled. We had just packaged it right back up and shoved it down the eager throats of the wealthy taxpayers of Orange County. Warren Buffett was also right---when the tide did finally go out, as it did rapidly in 1994, we learnt that Orange County was swimming naked.\" (Pg. 50) Later, he notes, \"Some dealers warned Orange County about the risks they were running. At the time, Robert Citron regarded himself as a genius, encouraged in this belief by the dealers who were cashing in on his brilliance... Dealers love sophisticated investors. They are easy pickings.\" (Pg. 127) He concludes, \"Who was paying for the party? It turned out to be Orange County taxpayers.\" (Pg. 214) He comments, \"Traders become locked into a life that is focuses exclusively on work and making money. They dress well and live well. Their reading consists of work materials, an occasional business book... and the odd pulp fiction or spy novel at airports... They exist in an isolated world of premium class business travel, limo transfers and five-star hotels. Butlers, valets, maids, cooks, lifestyle assistants and personal trainers surround them. This becomes the reality of existence. Others perform the simple acts of living for them. They cease to be capable of doing anything for themselves.\" (Pg. 78) He observes, \"There is a lot of activity around bonus time, very little of which has anything to do with trading... the day after the cheque clears there is frequently a glut of personnel announcements... Bonuses also drive spending. Luxury car dealers' fortunes are closely tied to the level of bonuses in banking...\" (Pg. 147) He recounts that \"a mathematician, had taught at the university and, tired of seeing his students earn far more than he did, joined the migration to banking. From time to time he visited his former academic colleagues to discuss the latest research. They were derisive about his job: they were involved in interesting work. The maths he used to model derivatives was trivial, undergraduate stuff. He consoled himself with the fact that he took home, in a good year, ten times what they made. He was a POW---a prisoner of Wall Street. It was about the money.\" (Pg. 183-184) The book can be somewhat disconcerting, in how it flits from one topic to another, interspersed with Das's personal recollections. Nevertheless, this is a fascinating (and somewhat prescient!) view of the derivatives and financial services industry, originally written just before the financial collapse of 2007-2009. It will be very welcome reading for anyone studying this era."

Like the others who failed, he was not Lewis-like enough to carry the narrative. On the plus side, I give Das credit for his clear explanations of the many derivative products that are out there today. Let’s award points, too, for his title, even though the book couldn’t quite live up to the humor it was meant to project. As for the shortcomings, the worst, I thought, was the short shrift he gave to the more human elements. Lewis can get you involved with the people – smart or naïve, honest or corrupt, successful or beaten to a pulp. You want to know what happens to them in the unfolding story. Your understanding is helped by the fact that whole messy business has been personalized. With Das, it’s more just a laundry list of the financial products and recycled press accounts of famous meltdowns. Whenever he does involve people, they’re either fictitious stick figures or categories of investment subspecies lumped together a little too conveniently into bins of disrepute. I’m sure he has a point when he says many of today’s financial instruments can postpone tax bills, shift risks to less savvy clients, and obfuscate product deliverables, but in my mind he overplayed his cynicism and lost credibility in the process. Not all M&A activity is cannibalism, not all derivatives were created to dupe someone, and not all people in the industry are crooked. He weakens his case when he implies as much."

        "text":"Das, a derivatives and risk expert, takes a very snarky look at these complex products that exploded the financial world in 2008 (though he is writing in 2006). Few people understand them, but whenever investors are flush with cash, money has to end up somewhere, and it's often seeking the highest return. The quants who create them may understand the equations, but not the real world consequences. The salespeople who sell them don't really understand them, and the buyers - in a system ruled by asymmetric information, where the seller always knows more than the buyer - rarely ever do. Although not as dull or abstruse as a textbook, which Das also writes, this book does go into the weeds, and readers who have no knowledge whatsoever of derivatives will find themselves floating on a sea of mysterious acronyms, coupled with diagrams and flow charts. Das keeps it punchy with chapterette headings such as \"Rough Trade,\" \"Bondage,\" \"Dukes of Hazard,\" and \"Tranche Warfare.\" He tells us that heading into a trial preparation as a plaintiff's expert witness, where an Indonesian noodle company that had been snookered on some derivatives was suing the issuer, he had looked up Portia's \"quality of mercy\" speech from The Merchant of Venice as a precaution. The book is plagued by typos: missing apostrophes and quotation marks, and astonishingly, a consistent misspelling of Warren Buffett's name. Former Salomon head John Gutfreund is repeatedly referred to as \"John Gutenfreund.\""

Oh sure, Option Trading is a wonky subject, and I’ve read many a dry book on the subject, but this one breaks the mold. It really does help you understand the mechanics of the derivative world as well as show you real world applications in a hilarious manner. Well, hilarious if you weren’t the one losing all your money in the deal. Or if somehow you weren’t part of the global economy within the last decade. Let me step back at this point. Options. Basically, they’re for farmers. You plant a crop, spend all year tending to it, and need to be certain of a profit. Rather than relying on the weather and gods, you enter a contract. You limit your maximum profit, but put a floor on the downside. The baker does the same… he needs to ensure the price of flour stays low enough to keep his business going down the line. He enters into a buy contract for the farmer’s goods. Simple enough. And sure, why not scale that concept into new industries as well? Think fuel costs for a transportation company… now you’re getting the idea. But here’s the thing. Why shouldn’t Wall Street take advantage of such a simple thing? I mean, little risk and profits from the sale of the contracts. How could these masters of the universe fuck that up? Just like everything else they touch, it’s gotta turn to gold for them. And that’s why this book shines. When you seriously get to the causes behind all the messes caused by these guys, you’ll laugh so hard that you’ll cry. Mostly because a little part of you died on the inside and you were already crying to begin with. But you’ll laugh too! Now, I work on the ass end of this machine, but I’m still an insider. The book made me look around my office and laugh. Then cry. You see, the formula is the same no matter where you go in this industry. A bunch of young know nothings running around selling crap that even their PhD financial quant engineers can’t understand. It’s perfect, the kids, most all who are in their 20s, peddle weapons of mass destruction to anyone dumb enough to buy their bomb. I see it every day at work. Kids ruining client’s people’s retirements because they’re just too stupid to…. Nah, wait, not stupid. They just don’t care. Either way, the stupid\/not caring allows them rack in major paychecks. Wealth is not created by the financial industry, it is simply moved about. Now you’re thinking, “Hey, great idea… let’s get smart people in there instead?” Wrong again, my friend. See, knowing ‘stuff’ in this industry is a bad thing. If you know stuff, you make the salesman feel bad about what they’re doing. This goes up the chain of command too. The author points out how management is based on hitting sales goals instead of skill or experience, because obviously this is a way to run the global economy. But it is. Sure, not everyone is horrid asshole when it comes to this industry, but we’ll never get far enough in this corporate climate to change things. Given the fact that this book was written pre Great Recession, one could almost say it serves as a witty warning of things to come. Too bad that I’m writing this follow up in 2014… because I can tell you first hand that nothing has changed. And it’s not the industries fault. It’s yours. Yep, you know that boring guy you ignored when you tried to talk finance…? Remember how you brought all your money over to the 20 year old who kept blowing smoke up your ass instead?"

The reader will be challenged which is good and bad. I have to admit this was one of the hardest books I've ever read as the material is pretty thick. The depth of the subject covered in this book not for a casual audience. I probably now know more than I'll ever want to about derivatives, and more than I probably should about the internal dealings of Wall Street. I agree with the Financial Times assessment from the cover that this is fascinating reading, but only for those who are deeply, deeply interested in the topic. I was pulled in by the title's inclusion of the word \"guns\" as I was hoping for a book similar to \"Confessions of an Economic Hit Man\" by John Perkins. I was looking for more adventure and explosions or something with at least hit of espionage, in fact I don't think a gun ever made an appearance, so I felt suckered by the title. This book really was closer to a text book study of derivatives or at least one man's life story of working in derivative markets on Wall Street, than anything having to do with guns. Though perhaps I just didn't go all in on the metaphor the author was trying to push on the reader. I prefer the analogy that derivatives are closer to WMD's, not guns. The book is a bit more interesting reading in 2015, as it was published in 2006 before the big crash. The author makes many points that you cringe reading in hindsight about just how out of hand things had gotten during the era of his authorship. Many \"shame on us\" moments, but when has that ever stopped us (the American public) before, and doubtful it will stop us in the future. If you are the right audience for this, dive right in, other wise pass on by as it's going to be a long journey."

For example, I had not previously realized how mark to market accounting can be used to inflate profits and traders' bonuses and can lead to margin calls on illiquid top level CDO tranches when the failure of lower tranches causes a ratings downgrade in upper level tranches that would probably actually pay full value if held to maturity, so even if the models were right in predicting tiny risks of default, the accounting rules helped to accelerate the financial crisis. The book does a good job in showing how derivatives can create an economic house of cards rather than having positive value in increasing liquidity and stability. But in trying to be light and humorous, the author frequently becomes too cynical and snarky. And he could have gone a bit deeper than he did in explaining the math and the modeling. Surely it can't all be as much of a shell game as the author suggests, or if it is, I wish that he would have given me a little more substance to reach that conclusion on my own."

I still stand by what I said about the book's tone -- from the punchy three-word title you could recognise it for the way it reads, sort of a stand up comic routine on the derivative markets. The first half wasn't especially compelling, as the castigation of financial professionals is so generalised. You have to be offensive to be funny, I guess. Once you get past that, the second half rocks -- perhaps because I don't take any personal offense, not being involved in derivatives. It's a great insider's view of how and why derivatives evolved, with great and simple (and cynical) explanations of why various structures were created (generally, to evade taxes, get around trading regulations, and other ways to give investors more yield and earn banks more fees). The anecdotes and narrative read like a late-night drink confessional -- probably exaggerated but sounding true enough in essence, and deeply educational. As mentioned previously, it doesn't claim to be a rigorous, comprehensive risk management textbook (which Das has written) so it won't be that sort of educational if that's what you're looking for. But through anecdotes it gives a sharp sense of the culture of the people involved, something you could never find even in very good textbooks."

Some chapters get a little repetitive but overall the book is really interesting. The examples of companies using derivatives to inflate their balances sheets or to comply with EU regulations before a merger just go to show how much craftiness and deception can come from the finance industry.

He wrote in the Preface, \"[This book] is the record of my time in the derivatives industry. It is a collection of tales about the products, the people and the strange goings-on in the business... There is almost no literature that explains the industry in an accessible way. There is also little that sets out the practices, some of which are insane, of this mysterious area of finance. [The book] explains the industry, how it operates and what it does. The book does not attempt to make a case for and against derivatives, it just shows what REALLY goes on every day in the dealing rooms in major financial centers, the real life dramas and rational madness that shape modern markets. [The book] is intended for two audiences. People in banking and finance ... will find it a wry and entertaining read... This book is also for those who want an accessible introduction to this weird and wonderful world. It will perhaps confirm their worst fears and prejudices about these strange instruments, what they are used for and the people who trade them.\" (Pg. xiii) He recalls, \"Many of today's traders hadn't been born when I stumbled accidently into derivatives trading. I had spent over 25 years in this world of traders, guns and money. The traders and money were clear enough. And you couldn't have financial weapons more powerful than derivatives---they were the big guns of the trade... How did I get there? I had followed the money... I had not known very much about derivatives when I started. How did I get here? ... This is that story. It is also coincidentally the story of the rise and rules of derivative trading---its 'knowns' and its 'unknowns.'\" (Pg. 18) He points out, \"The major defender of derivatives was Alan Greenspan, Chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York... The head of the central bank's role as cheerleader for the derivatives lobby was curious.\" (Pg. 20) He recalls, \"We needed 'innovation,' we were told. We created increasingly odd products. These obscure structures allowed us to earn higher margins than the cutthroat vanilla business... New structures that clients actually wanted were not that easy to create... The truth was that we weren't very creative but by golly, we were good at plagiarism. We chased our tails some more.\" (Pg. 41) Later, he adds, \"Survival requires keeping your head down. There was no point in resisting the latest fad. I just nodded and kept doing what I always did---trying to make money. No management fad lasted long. Before you know it, we would have a new 'business model' and would be entering a 'new paradigm.'\" (Pg. 74) He observes, \"Greenspan had been right---risk had truly been unbundled. We had just packaged it right back up and shoved it down the eager throats of the wealthy taxpayers of Orange County. Warren Buffett was also right---when the tide did finally go out, as it did rapidly in 1994, we learnt that Orange County was swimming naked.\" (Pg. 50) Later, he notes, \"Some dealers warned Orange County about the risks they were running. At the time, Robert Citron regarded himself as a genius, encouraged in this belief by the dealers who were cashing in on his brilliance... Dealers love sophisticated investors. They are easy pickings.\" (Pg. 127) He concludes, \"Who was paying for the party? It turned out to be Orange County taxpayers.\" (Pg. 214) He comments, \"Traders become locked into a life that is focuses exclusively on work and making money. They dress well and live well. Their reading consists of work materials, an occasional business book... and the odd pulp fiction or spy novel at airports... They exist in an isolated world of premium class business travel, limo transfers and five-star hotels. Butlers, valets, maids, cooks, lifestyle assistants and personal trainers surround them. This becomes the reality of existence. Others perform the simple acts of living for them. They cease to be capable of doing anything for themselves.\" (Pg. 78) He observes, \"There is a lot of activity around bonus time, very little of which has anything to do with trading... the day after the cheque clears there is frequently a glut of personnel announcements... Bonuses also drive spending. Luxury car dealers' fortunes are closely tied to the level of bonuses in banking...\" (Pg. 147) He recounts that \"a mathematician, had taught at the university and, tired of seeing his students earn far more than he did, joined the migration to banking. From time to time he visited his former academic colleagues to discuss the latest research. They were derisive about his job: they were involved in interesting work. The maths he used to model derivatives was trivial, undergraduate stuff. He consoled himself with the fact that he took home, in a good year, ten times what they made. He was a POW---a prisoner of Wall Street. It was about the money.\" (Pg. 183-184) The book can be somewhat disconcerting, in how it flits from one topic to another, interspersed with Das's personal recollections. Nevertheless, this is a fascinating (and somewhat prescient!) view of the derivatives and financial services industry, originally written just before the financial collapse of 2007-2009. It will be very welcome reading for anyone studying this era."

Like the others who failed, he was not Lewis-like enough to carry the narrative. On the plus side, I give Das credit for his clear explanations of the many derivative products that are out there today. Let’s award points, too, for his title, even though the book couldn’t quite live up to the humor it was meant to project. As for the shortcomings, the worst, I thought, was the short shrift he gave to the more human elements. Lewis can get you involved with the people – smart or naïve, honest or corrupt, successful or beaten to a pulp. You want to know what happens to them in the unfolding story. Your understanding is helped by the fact that whole messy business has been personalized. With Das, it’s more just a laundry list of the financial products and recycled press accounts of famous meltdowns. Whenever he does involve people, they’re either fictitious stick figures or categories of investment subspecies lumped together a little too conveniently into bins of disrepute. I’m sure he has a point when he says many of today’s financial instruments can postpone tax bills, shift risks to less savvy clients, and obfuscate product deliverables, but in my mind he overplayed his cynicism and lost credibility in the process. Not all M&A activity is cannibalism, not all derivatives were created to dupe someone, and not all people in the industry are crooked. He weakens his case when he implies as much."

        "text":"Das, a derivatives and risk expert, takes a very snarky look at these complex products that exploded the financial world in 2008 (though he is writing in 2006). Few people understand them, but whenever investors are flush with cash, money has to end up somewhere, and it's often seeking the highest return. The quants who create them may understand the equations, but not the real world consequences. The salespeople who sell them don't really understand them, and the buyers - in a system ruled by asymmetric information, where the seller always knows more than the buyer - rarely ever do. Although not as dull or abstruse as a textbook, which Das also writes, this book does go into the weeds, and readers who have no knowledge whatsoever of derivatives will find themselves floating on a sea of mysterious acronyms, coupled with diagrams and flow charts. Das keeps it punchy with chapterette headings such as \"Rough Trade,\" \"Bondage,\" \"Dukes of Hazard,\" and \"Tranche Warfare.\" He tells us that heading into a trial preparation as a plaintiff's expert witness, where an Indonesian noodle company that had been snookered on some derivatives was suing the issuer, he had looked up Portia's \"quality of mercy\" speech from The Merchant of Venice as a precaution. The book is plagued by typos: missing apostrophes and quotation marks, and astonishingly, a consistent misspelling of Warren Buffett's name. Former Salomon head John Gutfreund is repeatedly referred to as \"John Gutenfreund.\""

Oh sure, Option Trading is a wonky subject, and I’ve read many a dry book on the subject, but this one breaks the mold. It really does help you understand the mechanics of the derivative world as well as show you real world applications in a hilarious manner. Well, hilarious if you weren’t the one losing all your money in the deal. Or if somehow you weren’t part of the global economy within the last decade. Let me step back at this point. Options. Basically, they’re for farmers. You plant a crop, spend all year tending to it, and need to be certain of a profit. Rather than relying on the weather and gods, you enter a contract. You limit your maximum profit, but put a floor on the downside. The baker does the same… he needs to ensure the price of flour stays low enough to keep his business going down the line. He enters into a buy contract for the farmer’s goods. Simple enough. And sure, why not scale that concept into new industries as well? Think fuel costs for a transportation company… now you’re getting the idea. But here’s the thing. Why shouldn’t Wall Street take advantage of such a simple thing? I mean, little risk and profits from the sale of the contracts. How could these masters of the universe fuck that up? Just like everything else they touch, it’s gotta turn to gold for them. And that’s why this book shines. When you seriously get to the causes behind all the messes caused by these guys, you’ll laugh so hard that you’ll cry. Mostly because a little part of you died on the inside and you were already crying to begin with. But you’ll laugh too! Now, I work on the ass end of this machine, but I’m still an insider. The book made me look around my office and laugh. Then cry. You see, the formula is the same no matter where you go in this industry. A bunch of young know nothings running around selling crap that even their PhD financial quant engineers can’t understand. It’s perfect, the kids, most all who are in their 20s, peddle weapons of mass destruction to anyone dumb enough to buy their bomb. I see it every day at work. Kids ruining client’s people’s retirements because they’re just too stupid to…. Nah, wait, not stupid. They just don’t care. Either way, the stupid\/not caring allows them rack in major paychecks. Wealth is not created by the financial industry, it is simply moved about. Now you’re thinking, “Hey, great idea… let’s get smart people in there instead?” Wrong again, my friend. See, knowing ‘stuff’ in this industry is a bad thing. If you know stuff, you make the salesman feel bad about what they’re doing. This goes up the chain of command too. The author points out how management is based on hitting sales goals instead of skill or experience, because obviously this is a way to run the global economy. But it is. Sure, not everyone is horrid asshole when it comes to this industry, but we’ll never get far enough in this corporate climate to change things. Given the fact that this book was written pre Great Recession, one could almost say it serves as a witty warning of things to come. Too bad that I’m writing this follow up in 2014… because I can tell you first hand that nothing has changed. And it’s not the industries fault. It’s yours. Yep, you know that boring guy you ignored when you tried to talk finance…? Remember how you brought all your money over to the 20 year old who kept blowing smoke up your ass instead?"

The reader will be challenged which is good and bad. I have to admit this was one of the hardest books I've ever read as the material is pretty thick. The depth of the subject covered in this book not for a casual audience. I probably now know more than I'll ever want to about derivatives, and more than I probably should about the internal dealings of Wall Street. I agree with the Financial Times assessment from the cover that this is fascinating reading, but only for those who are deeply, deeply interested in the topic. I was pulled in by the title's inclusion of the word \"guns\" as I was hoping for a book similar to \"Confessions of an Economic Hit Man\" by John Perkins. I was looking for more adventure and explosions or something with at least hit of espionage, in fact I don't think a gun ever made an appearance, so I felt suckered by the title. This book really was closer to a text book study of derivatives or at least one man's life story of working in derivative markets on Wall Street, than anything having to do with guns. Though perhaps I just didn't go all in on the metaphor the author was trying to push on the reader. I prefer the analogy that derivatives are closer to WMD's, not guns. The book is a bit more interesting reading in 2015, as it was published in 2006 before the big crash. The author makes many points that you cringe reading in hindsight about just how out of hand things had gotten during the era of his authorship. Many \"shame on us\" moments, but when has that ever stopped us (the American public) before, and doubtful it will stop us in the future. If you are the right audience for this, dive right in, other wise pass on by as it's going to be a long journey."

For example, I had not previously realized how mark to market accounting can be used to inflate profits and traders' bonuses and can lead to margin calls on illiquid top level CDO tranches when the failure of lower tranches causes a ratings downgrade in upper level tranches that would probably actually pay full value if held to maturity, so even if the models were right in predicting tiny risks of default, the accounting rules helped to accelerate the financial crisis. The book does a good job in showing how derivatives can create an economic house of cards rather than having positive value in increasing liquidity and stability. But in trying to be light and humorous, the author frequently becomes too cynical and snarky. And he could have gone a bit deeper than he did in explaining the math and the modeling. Surely it can't all be as much of a shell game as the author suggests, or if it is, I wish that he would have given me a little more substance to reach that conclusion on my own."

I still stand by what I said about the book's tone -- from the punchy three-word title you could recognise it for the way it reads, sort of a stand up comic routine on the derivative markets. The first half wasn't especially compelling, as the castigation of financial professionals is so generalised. You have to be offensive to be funny, I guess. Once you get past that, the second half rocks -- perhaps because I don't take any personal offense, not being involved in derivatives. It's a great insider's view of how and why derivatives evolved, with great and simple (and cynical) explanations of why various structures were created (generally, to evade taxes, get around trading regulations, and other ways to give investors more yield and earn banks more fees). The anecdotes and narrative read like a late-night drink confessional -- probably exaggerated but sounding true enough in essence, and deeply educational. As mentioned previously, it doesn't claim to be a rigorous, comprehensive risk management textbook (which Das has written) so it won't be that sort of educational if that's what you're looking for. But through anecdotes it gives a sharp sense of the culture of the people involved, something you could never find even in very good textbooks."

Some chapters get a little repetitive but overall the book is really interesting. The examples of companies using derivatives to inflate their balances sheets or to comply with EU regulations before a merger just go to show how much craftiness and deception can come from the finance industry.

He wrote in the Preface, \"[This book] is the record of my time in the derivatives industry. It is a collection of tales about the products, the people and the strange goings-on in the business... There is almost no literature that explains the industry in an accessible way. There is also little that sets out the practices, some of which are insane, of this mysterious area of finance. [The book] explains the industry, how it operates and what it does. The book does not attempt to make a case for and against derivatives, it just shows what REALLY goes on every day in the dealing rooms in major financial centers, the real life dramas and rational madness that shape modern markets. [The book] is intended for two audiences. People in banking and finance ... will find it a wry and entertaining read... This book is also for those who want an accessible introduction to this weird and wonderful world. It will perhaps confirm their worst fears and prejudices about these strange instruments, what they are used for and the people who trade them.\" (Pg. xiii) He recalls, \"Many of today's traders hadn't been born when I stumbled accidently into derivatives trading. I had spent over 25 years in this world of traders, guns and money. The traders and money were clear enough. And you couldn't have financial weapons more powerful than derivatives---they were the big guns of the trade... How did I get there? I had followed the money... I had not known very much about derivatives when I started. How did I get here? ... This is that story. It is also coincidentally the story of the rise and rules of derivative trading---its 'knowns' and its 'unknowns.'\" (Pg. 18) He points out, \"The major defender of derivatives was Alan Greenspan, Chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York... The head of the central bank's role as cheerleader for the derivatives lobby was curious.\" (Pg. 20) He recalls, \"We needed 'innovation,' we were told. We created increasingly odd products. These obscure structures allowed us to earn higher margins than the cutthroat vanilla business... New structures that clients actually wanted were not that easy to create... The truth was that we weren't very creative but by golly, we were good at plagiarism. We chased our tails some more.\" (Pg. 41) Later, he adds, \"Survival requires keeping your head down. There was no point in resisting the latest fad. I just nodded and kept doing what I always did---trying to make money. No management fad lasted long. Before you know it, we would have a new 'business model' and would be entering a 'new paradigm.'\" (Pg. 74) He observes, \"Greenspan had been right---risk had truly been unbundled. We had just packaged it right back up and shoved it down the eager throats of the wealthy taxpayers of Orange County. Warren Buffett was also right---when the tide did finally go out, as it did rapidly in 1994, we learnt that Orange County was swimming naked.\" (Pg. 50) Later, he notes, \"Some dealers warned Orange County about the risks they were running. At the time, Robert Citron regarded himself as a genius, encouraged in this belief by the dealers who were cashing in on his brilliance... Dealers love sophisticated investors. They are easy pickings.\" (Pg. 127) He concludes, \"Who was paying for the party? It turned out to be Orange County taxpayers.\" (Pg. 214) He comments, \"Traders become locked into a life that is focuses exclusively on work and making money. They dress well and live well. Their reading consists of work materials, an occasional business book... and the odd pulp fiction or spy novel at airports... They exist in an isolated world of premium class business travel, limo transfers and five-star hotels. Butlers, valets, maids, cooks, lifestyle assistants and personal trainers surround them. This becomes the reality of existence. Others perform the simple acts of living for them. They cease to be capable of doing anything for themselves.\" (Pg. 78) He observes, \"There is a lot of activity around bonus time, very little of which has anything to do with trading... the day after the cheque clears there is frequently a glut of personnel announcements... Bonuses also drive spending. Luxury car dealers' fortunes are closely tied to the level of bonuses in banking...\" (Pg. 147) He recounts that \"a mathematician, had taught at the university and, tired of seeing his students earn far more than he did, joined the migration to banking. From time to time he visited his former academic colleagues to discuss the latest research. They were derisive about his job: they were involved in interesting work. The maths he used to model derivatives was trivial, undergraduate stuff. He consoled himself with the fact that he took home, in a good year, ten times what they made. He was a POW---a prisoner of Wall Street. It was about the money.\" (Pg. 183-184) The book can be somewhat disconcerting, in how it flits from one topic to another, interspersed with Das's personal recollections. Nevertheless, this is a fascinating (and somewhat prescient!) view of the derivatives and financial services industry, originally written just before the financial collapse of 2007-2009. It will be very welcome reading for anyone studying this era."

You do not need to be a financial geek to appreciate this book. It is written in a very entertaining way. For those that are interested you can expend some mental effort and get a basic understanding of derivatives, but you can ignore the details and still enjoy the story. The chapter on credit derivatives is particulary entertaining given the recent meltdown"

        "text":"Manchester County, Virginia doesn't exist. Never has. After reading The Known World, however, you'd be forgiven if you thought you could take a tour of it's plantations and slave cemetaries on your vacation to colonial Williamsburg. The complicated pre-civil war Southern society that Edward P. Jones creates feels as real and surreal as any factual history of slavery you've read. It was not so much the story of Henry Townsend, a black slave owner, and all the people that his death allows us to meet that engaged me. It was the world, a world where I could taste the soil I might till and the women I might marry and the terrible choices I might be faced with, that put it's claws in me and refused to let go. It took me nearly 2 months to finish the book's 388 pages. It should've been a quick read. It is a fascinating place with peculiar problems and characters I cried for on more than one occasion. It should've been a quick read but I kept asking myself this question: who would I have been? The slave, toiling away in the field? The overseer, unable to see the world for what it truly was? The freed man, working desperately to free the rest of his family? The smart child, taken under the wing of the rich white slave owner and convinced that there was nothing wrong with owning another human being? The broken black man tortured by his family's wealth built on the backs of men and women that look just like me? The slave too proud, too strong, too powerful to let another take his freedom? Who would I have been? Who am I now? In matters of race, there is always that fool's point, usually made by a white person (though not always) that asks,\"why aren't you over it, already? Can't we just let it go?\" It is a way to end an uncomfortable conversation. The reasons don't matter. I know many a person for which the sticky tar baby of race in America is simply a discussion they can't stick their hands in. It is too difficult. Too raw. Too cloudy to be sure that people will remain friends after an honest chat. The way I feel when I read books like The Known World is my answer. No matter how well-adjusted, how integrated, how loving of my fellow man, how multiculti kumbayah I am, I'm not over it. I can't let it go. This fictional world was very real not all that long ago. It's effects still ripple through our every day. The world I know doesn't exist without it. Highly highly recommended."

        "text":"there is that old adage that a good book will tell you how to read it. and i have no idea to whom that should be attributed, only that my undergrad professors seemed to have been born to quote that thought endlessly: in my gothic lit class, my enlightenment class, my victorian lit class... the african and irish lit professors mostly kept their mouths shut on the subject. but the rest - hoo boy - did they love to drag that old chestnut out... and it makes sense, to a certain degree. but this book doesn't tell you how to read it so much as it presents itself to the reader, like a fat man in a speedo lolling around on an undersized towel saying, \"look at me ladies, you like it?? this is what you get!!\" it almost demands that you read it and like it. but i was disobedient. every sentence, every paragraph, seemed to be trying to contain multitudes. and i am a fan of \"thick\" writing, but the manner in which this book presented itself quickly soured on me. there were too many stories or episodes ending with, \"years from now, when celia was on her deathbed, she would think back to her third year of marriage\",in a scene where she has yet to even be married, or right after two characters are introduced to each other, \"this would be the last time they would meet until the hailstorm of aught-six\" - and i am making up all the names and situations here, but you get an idea of the shape of my complaints. it's constant foreshadowing and some of the foreshadowing is just teasing, as the events never come to pass in the novel itself. it's like sitting down to tea with a god in his dotage, rambling and making connections only he can understand; seeing the past and future simultaneously. \"hey, karen, didn't you really like that kjaerstaad trilogy, where he basically did what you are complaining about here??\" yeah, what? so? shut up - isn't it past your bedtime?? yeah, but sure, that's true. but for some reason, it bothered me here. all i wanted was a straightforward linear narrative about a fascinating subject matter: free black men and women who owned slaves. when i read roll of thunder, hear my cry last summer, the whole transition period between slavery and freedom really excited my brainparts. i dunno. and mister jones was a real sweetheart when he came for the new yorker festival and i waited in line to get a book signed for a friend and i really wanted to like it because it seems like a nice fat sprawling sweeping story the way i like, but i just got lost in the names and the timeline and my confusion turned into apathy. it's like this guy you date who seems really perfect - he is smart and looks like gabriel byrne and he dotes on you and everything is fun and on paper it all looks great and you know you should really like him, but he just doesn't make you laugh so you run off and leave him for a rockstar. you know? because i feel like i should like this one because it is award-winning, and my experience with the african-american novel is middling (although i love the african novel, the west indian novel and the afro-canadian novel - go figure) so i feel like as someone who appreciates literature in general, i should totally love this. but it wasn't there for me. oh, chris wilson, i am sorry. now you are going to want full custody because your baby is being raised among heathens. years from now, when my and chris wilson's book-baby became the mayor of littleton, he would read this review and a tear of sorrow would come to his eye at my short-sightedness. come to my blog!"

        "text":"I know this is a critically acclaimed book, a Pulitzer winner, and a book tackling a difficult and complex stain on America history: slavery and black slave owners. There are moments when the book does say some interesting things or reveal some unsavory and uncomfortable truths, but it was so hard to engage with as a reader. I mean, I hung in with DFW through the first 600 pages of Infinite Jest where nothing happens -- but because I was fascinated by Hal, Orin, Marathe, Steeply, and Mario and Madame Psychosis who all fascinated me. There were literally dozens of other characters but these all pulled me in. In The Known World, there are also dozens of characters but none that I grew any attachment too. It was as if the author Jones was using a hand-held camera and no stabilizer so that the images were jumpy and out of focus. It reminded me sometimes of how the world seems to my myopic eyes between taking off my glasses in the morning and putting in my contact lenses. The narration also highly annoyed me. All the parenthetical \"in 60 years so and so will do such as such\" were meaningless because I was given neither enough time nor enough detail to give a shit. Further, there is this reference to \"years later they would all turn into human torches in front of the dry foods store\", but no mention afterwards of to what this referred. But the most annoying bit was in using the Canadian journalist frame at about page 130 or so (which then only briefly appears in the narrative 200 pages later in a parenthetical throwaway comment, it is said that the journalist would never marry his heart's desire yet 3 pages later, they marry and that coming to talk to Fern that there was some incomprehensible stuff that happens off-screen that morning (also never adequately explained) and so she was not going to open up to the journalist and yet we still find her filling in details about Henry, Moses and Caledonia 30 pages later. Too much inconsistency - was the editor asleep or stoned and missed these? So, despite taking on a complex subject, Jones is no Faulkner as his South does not eve approach that of the Great William. He is not as good as Pynchon or DFW is manipulating time and space in a narrative that was 100 or 150 pages too long and felt it, and he is not Alice Walker or Toni Morrison who brought us the most amazing, poignant, and powerful images of slavery and its residual impacts generations later that I have ever read. So, read Beloved or Absalom, Absalom if you want to hear about the South and I expect you will be less frustrated, but every bit enraged at this deplorable institution that is a cancer on the American past."

        "text":"Ambitious, Interesting, Disorganized In an interview, Edward P. Jones revealed that The Known World took shape around 1) when he heard that Black people had owned slaves and 2) when he read a thin paperback in high school about a Jewish man who decided to join the Nazi party, how he acted in opposition to how one would expect. The Known World is an ambitious novel which aims to describe the world of 1855 where Henry Townsend has recently died. As a result of his death, a cloud of uncertainty hangs in the air as he leaves behind his widow, Caldonia, and the undetermined fate of the slaves he purchased to work his land. Although the plot is interesting, this book is disorganized. It covers many different characters and rapidly shifts time periods. I would be reading along and then the text would say “and this person lived to be 93 years old and had 235 grandchildren.” (paraphrasing) Countless times, I had to stop and reread because the storytelling was so clunky. In The Known World, there are quite a few references to Adam and Eve, even references to Milton (Paradise Lost). My favorite author, Philip Pullman, loves to talk about this topic and how in his works he wanted his characters to find their way back to The Garden by taking the long way around. So this quote on page 329 stood out: “There was a long way around but he chose not to take it.” There is a character in The Known World by the name of Anderson Frazier. He creates and distributes pamphlets and interviews Fern Elston. In my opinion, this pamphlet could have provided a framework to systematically organize the characters instead of the resulting jumbled and confusing soup of characters and timelines. The Known World has some unforgettable moments, but the organization of the narrative reduces the enjoyment of the reading experience.

        "text":"This is a complex novel, with dense writing, a non-linear structure, and an abundance of characters. It reads much like a true historical account of a place, Manchester County, Virginia, and time, pre-Civil War 1800s. This could very nearly have passed for a non-fiction book; each character feels so real, their personal stories and histories so authentic. The author even goes so far as to tell us what happens to many of them ten, twenty or even fifty years in the future. And yet, Edward P. Jones himself states: \"The county and town of Manchester, Virginia, and every human being in those places, are products of my imagination… The census records I made up for Manchester were, again, simply to make the reader feel that the town and the county and the people lived and breathed in central Virginia once upon a time…\" Well, consider me duped. At first I really thought such a county existed and the data presented were genuine facts. As my son passed through the living room, I even shouted out some sort of statistic or another and asked if he had ever read about such a thing in his history classes. He couldn’t recall, but it sounded ‘familiar’. Right, because much of this could have been true, yet it wasn’t. The institution of slavery of course was all too real and cruel, and that’s what this book is about, and this is the truth. Slavery in all its forms is evil. Henry Townsend is a black farmer. He is a former slave that with the purchase of freedom and some land becomes a slave owner himself. Henry and his wife Caldonia own a small plantation near the border of his former master’s much larger one. I could not wrap my head around why on earth a freed man would ever want to enslave another human being. Henry and other black slave owners like him justify their actions: \"Henry had always said that he wanted to be a better master than any white man he had ever known. He did not understand that the kind of world he wanted to create was doomed before he had even spoken the first syllable of the word master.\" Well, as the old saying goes, ‘the road to hell is paved with good intentions.’ When Henry dies, all hell breaks loose, and we begin to see the ill-fated consequences of an institution that is immoral and corrupt. A narrative that seems to jump around in time and between characters eventually comes together into a whole as consequences and events snowball out of control. Lives are permanently changed. Some for the worst, others (we hope) for the better. They all become woven together much like the massive tapestry hanging on the wall of another place in another time. Each is part of the story. Everyone is responsible for the events which passed, were allowed to pass despite the huge injustice to humanity. This book is not easy to read. The structure is challenging and the topic is gloomy, albeit important. What happens to the people we grow to care for is often horrifying and heartbreaking. But it is well-written and extremely impactful. An important novel which is well worth your time and attention if you are up for the challenge. It won't suit everyone, but if you are at all interested, I encourage you to pick this one up. \"What I feared most at that moment is what I still fear: that they would remember my history, that I, no matter what I had always said to the contrary, owned people of our Race.\""

I'd read you, you'd provide enlightenment or emotional catharsis or entertainment, maybe even all three.

Maybe it was the masturbation scene right at the start. Or the characters that I just couldn't get into - I could hardly tell some of them apart. Or the way the narrative seemed to skip all over without any focus. Maybe I just didn't give you enough pages. I'm sure you got better as you went along.

        "text":"There’s irony that I read more than half of this wrenching, ugly, hopeful, stirring, and grievous book while holding a sleeping baby in my arms. Because there is a lot of life and death in this take on pre-Civil War Virginia. I knew little about the book except that the author wrote it after reading about freed Black folks owning slaves. In delving into this issue, which in any modern conversation circle must bring dissonance, disbelief, and maybe even disgust, I became increasingly moved and disturbed. A difficult book, both because it’s an unflinching look at slavery, but also because it’s written in a James Joyce-ish style — lots of asides and stream of consciousness text. The author careens from generation to generation and back again in often the same paragraph. Yet it worked for me. It reads like a memoir of an entire county’s 150-year history complete with dozens of families represented. What results is simply, UNFORGETTABLE. There are characters whose faces I imagined while reading and characters whose stories I became invested in that will haunt me. Not in the truth of a fictional characterization but more because the ugliness of humanity was so blatantly on display and sadly remains real to this day. As I bid farewell to the slaves, slaveowners, children of both and ministers, sheriffs and patrollers of this novel, I will not forget their names. And I can’t help but wonder who would I have been in Manchester County, Virginia? (Reviewed 2\/12\/25)"

        "text":"I'm going to have to rave a bit, because this is one of the best books I've read in the past ten years. Jones packs in all the historical detail you could want, and of course he's hit on a subject--black slaveowners--that in and of itself is tabloid-sensational. Where lesser writers might lean too hard on the sensational aspect (or rely on it to bolster an otherwise weak narrative), Jones works it into a compelling and powerful story. What makes it so powerful is a mix of fascinating characters who are woven into a series of overlapping plotlines. For me it's the structuring that is so brilliant (geek alert: I actually diagrammed the time shifts in the chapters as an exercise, to see when and how Jones yoked the whole thing together). This less than linear approach might be frustrating to those who just want things to be straightforward, but stick with it: the shifts provide suspense as well as texture, and they propel more than one storyline at once. They do all come together, trust me. I also admire the overarching authorial voice in the novel, which certainly leans toward the formal, but also comes across as aware of the history it's grappling with: here and there Jones projects his voice forward for a moment, or seemingly digresses with factual material and research. Again it's all part of the tapestry and the mix, and I also think that the level of narrative awareness (which never disengages long enough to derail anything) adds another layer to the very idea of history--making the whole historical and contemporary both. And for those of you who can do without all of the above writerly blather (a thousand pardons), you'll find in this book characters who are engaging, ignorant, cruel, earnest, sympathetic, tragic, hopeful, flawed--in short, complicated. Halfway through you'll be fighting off the impulse to skip ahead to learn everyone's fate. Finally, I'll say that this book isn't perfect--there are aspects of what I've described above that sometimes don't work: narrative turns that do seem pointless digressions, a character or two a bit stereotypical or annoying. No matter. This book aims high, as brilliant works of art do, and the result is nothing short of amazing."

        "text":"This book demands that you read it slowly and intently. Like eating a huge Thanksgiving dinner, you need to pause and digest before you have the next course. At the outset, the plot seems to be all over the place, bouncing from character to character, telling too many stories, not telling enough and then seeming to tell too much. Ah, but then, you make a little progress and the rhythm begins to assert itself, the stories begin to weave together, the minute details begin to become a diorama, the picture stops being a blur and comes into sharp focus. This isn’t one man’s story, or even the story of one place, this is the story of all men and this is the tale of a world. This book is not so much about race as it is about the abject insanity and evil of the institution of slavery, wherever it is found, whoever is practicing it. In this system, there are free black masters holding black slaves, some of them well-meaning, but it does not make the practice any less immoral. There are white men who love their black mistresses and the children they bear, but it does not remove the fact that they hold a dominion over them that is not borne of love in any of its guises. There are also individuals who are victims of the system and others who refuse to be victims of the system, even at the cost of their lives. I loved many of Jones’ characters, notably Augustus and Mildred Townsend. They exemplify what is the best in us. I felt sorry for some of them, like Sheriff John Skiffington, who would like to be better than this society allows him to be, and Caldonia Townsend’s brother, Calvin, who wishes to go to New York so that he will not have to bear witness to the cruelties around him, cruelties he must realized have escaped him only because of a trick of fortune. I despised some of them, and I recognized most of them. The petty and jealous, who must have dominion over someone to feel they have worth; the ungrateful and traitorous, who would turn upon a friend to put some silver in their own pockets; the meek and hopeless, who bow to the yoke and try simply to find a corner in which they are allowed to exist; the defiant and strong-minded, who fight with their last breath because to do otherwise is to prop up the indefensible; all are here. What I loved most about this novel is its genuineness, its lack of exaggeration or hyperbole, where surely none is needed, its emphasis on the day-to-day injustice of an institution that is accepted as insurmountable or even correct only because it is what is. Edward P. Jones has leveled an attack at the heart of mankind and defied one to imagine what they would have done, what they would have dared to do, in such a place and time."

        "text":"A very complex and beautiful, compelling book about Henry, a former slave who becomes a slave owner, & his wife Caldonia. But they're just the start - the book is really a series of stories & vignettes about the families, friends, neighbors & community surrounding Henry & Caldonia. It took me a really long time to get into the book, because there are so many characters, some important & some not, & the book jumps around in time, making it difficult to follow. Trust me, use the cast of characters at the end of this edition (why not place this at the beginning?!) & give up your expectations about traditional narrative format, & you'll LOVE this book as much as I did. In life, we have our own story kind of playing in our head, & at the same time we have all these other stories we're hearing - the story about your mother's great-uncle. The story about your brother in law's neighbor. The one about your sister's husband's aunt & her neighbor. the one about your coworker's mother. You know all those stories? That's what this book is like - some characters are more important than others, so you hear more of their stories, but minor characters have stories too, & they sort of appear out of nowhere, & you get to hear their story, & then they're gone. It's really very cool! I particularly loved the story of the womanizing slave who has a vision during a lightning storm\/tornado - & becomes the founder of an orphanage. And the little tiny story about the family who don't want to give up their cow, & the woman goes into the barn to milk the cow & there's this lovely description of her squirting the cow's milk into a cat's mouth, & if you've ever seen a cat eat with true contentment you will recognize the cat body language that Jones describes. Toward the end of the book there's a very powerful scene where a character, who isn't a particularly \"good\" character, says there should be a lantern or light of truth in the world, an actual place where people can stand & tell the truth without fear of retribution, where one might be able to right a wrong. It's a moment where you think, yes this guy could right the wrong by speaking out, because his fear of having people think he's \"on the negro's side\" is...well, wrong! But that's his fear & in that moment of the book you understand it & you think, yeah, what if he could speak out under that light of truth & not have anyone judge him? How wonderful would that be? While the book depicts the horrors of slavery, & there are a few characters who are outright despicable, there are many shades of gray in Jones' vision as well. It's a book that will make you think about slavery, the myths & realities & tragedies of it all, & on top of that it'll make you think about your own life & all the people you've known & how complex & interesting we all are, really. It's beautifully written & the characters will stick in your head as if you'd known them too. Oddly, I think what I initially disliked most about this book - its multitude of characters & convoluted timeline - is what I ended up really enjoying! Another example of a book that made my head expand, with some creakiness, but I'm glad the expansion can still happen!"

        "text":"In this book I learned that there used to be black slaveholders in the US. I thought that only white people were allowed to own slaves during the time that owning slaves were like owning properties. During that pre-Abolition time. During those sad dark days in the American history. Black Edward P. Jones (born 1951) wrote this historical epic novel, The Known World based on the not well known fact that there were some black slaveholders (black people owning black slaves) in the state of Virginia during the time in the US when owning slave is legal. Wikipedia has this to say: \"Slavery in the United States was a form of unfree labor which existed as a legal institution in North America for more than a century before the founding of the United States in 1776, and continued mostly in the South until the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution in 1865.[1] The first English colony in North America, Virginia, first imported Africans in 1619, a practice earlier established in the Spanish colonies as early as the 1560s.[2] Most slaves were black and were held by whites, although some Native Americans and free blacks also held slaves; there were a small number of white slaves as well.[3]\" Winner of the 2004 Pulitzer Award for Fiction, The Known World is one of the most memorable reads I had this year. It is not an easy book to read. This 388-page novel left me with a heavy chest each time I closed the book. Each page is gloomy and sad. The novel is well-told with lyrical prose creating a big canvas of imagery in one's mind while reading. In that big canvas are memorable and three-dimensional numerous characters most of them black slaves. No character is downright bad or good. The detailed description of the sceneries of a fictional county called Manchester and the true depictions of the characters are exceptionally striking that I had to slow down in my reading to savor the story and hold on *tugging to them, cheering them on* to each characters. Reading the last page left me with a heavy heart. I would not want to let go of that image of Manchester and say goodbye Please don't go yet to the characters that I already became part of my literary world. The world that resides in the recesses of my brain. The world that is known only to me populated by people who I met only in my readings. In terms of writing, Jones extensively use the technique called prolepsis that I first encountered reading Muriel Sparks' The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie (1961). Jones explained this in the interview (appendix of the book) saying that he is the God of those characters so he knows what happened in the life of each characters from the time he\/she was born up to the time his\/her death. The most moving example of this use was with the character of the child Tessie . One fine day of September 1855, their mistress Caldonia saw the 5-y\/o Tessie playing with a wooden toy horse. Caldonia says to the child: That is very nice, Tessie to which Tessie responded, My papa did this for me . In January 2002, on her deathbed, the old Tessie asked her caretaker to get the wooden toy horse from the attic. While holding the toy, she breathed her last saying the same thing: My papa did this for me . My heart stopped beating. Tears welled up in my eyes. That scene is just one of the many moving scenes about those slaves in that time of the history in Virginia when black people were traded like they were not human but properties. I can make this review very long. There are just too many good things I would like to say here but I am afraid that no review can make justice to a book as good as this."

        "text":"Jar Of Death Pick #28 3.5 Stars Most people probably believe that the only people who owned slaves were white people. But that's actually not the truth. Free blacks owned other black people. Some free blacks bought their family members and others just wanted the slave labor. Native Americans owned slaves for much of the same reasons. The Known World introduces us to some of those people. The Known World has won a whole gang of awards, so we know its an important book and the writing is top notch. My only problems with the book were the fact that there were too many characters. You know this is a pet peeve of mine and I lost track of all the characters in this book. My other problem was that it jumped backwards and forwards in time way too much. Most of the time jumps were super confusing. I liked The Known World but I think I might not be smart enough to read this book. I'll probably reread it sometime in the future and I do recommend to others because its a brilliant book."

However, any plot that might exist was buried so deep beneath the convoluted chronology and extraneous characters and details that I decided I didn't care to keep digging for it, and quit on page 198. The author seemed determined to insert every existing anecdote about slavery into one novel. This might have worked better as a compilation of essays or short stories."

        "text":"The Known World does this weird thing: it cites its sources. And it's weird because they don't exist. There are passages like this: [Manchester, VA] went through a period of years and years of what University of Virginia historian Roberta Murphy in a 1948 book would call 'peace and prosperity'. Jones goes on to tell you the publication history of that book, and a few more things about what was in it, and to imply that Roberta Murphy was a little racist. But there is no Roberta Murphy, there is no book, there is no Manchester, VA. What is Jones up to? Wyatt Mason notes : What research on the subject Jones undertook was, in fact, quickly derailed after he happened upon an account of a white slave owner who spent her days abusing one of her black slaves, a little girl, by beating her head against a wall. “If I had wanted to tell the whole story of slavery, Americans couldn’t have taken that,” Jones told an interviewer. “People want to think that there was slavery, and then we got beyond it. People don’t want to hear that a woman would take a child and bang her head against the wall day after day. It’s nice that I didn’t read all those books. What I would have had to put down is far, far harsher and bleaker. Too much of a bummer? It's not that The Known World is a feel-good novel. Ears and Achilles tendons will be sliced. It follows the rules of slavery books: slave narratives always had happy endings; later, fictional slave narratives always have sad endings. But Toni Morrison has a different opinion about what Americans can and can't take. Shit, so does Harriet Jacobs. And Jones knows this, so he's being disingenuous. And you notice that he's talking about books he didn't actually read. NPR says, Jones collected two shelves of books about slavery, but never got around to reading them. Still, the author was able to use his imagination, and stories he had heard growing up, to make his characters come alive. \"I decided the people I'd created were real enough and I had just accumulated enough information about what the world was like in the South before 1865 to allow me to lie and get away with it,\" he says. Look, I don't mean to say Jones isn't telling the truth. I don't know if he is, and neither does he; neither of us read those two shelves of books about slavery. But the citation of imaginary sources in the book itself serves to either add authenticity that's undeserved, or - if you follow up on those sources - underline its lack of authenticity. I'm puzzled by it. This sort of meta-sourcing has been done before - by Nabokov in Pale Fire, by Cervantes, and in its closest parallel by Borges in his first collection, Universal History of Iniquity, which also confused me. It's especially jarring here, maybe just because I find the truth of slavery a fraught subject, and maybe because the layers go so deep - even in interviews about his lack of authenticity, he appears to be consciously inauthentic. I don't know, man, I don't get it. But anyway: is it a good made-up story about made-up people? Yeah, sure, totally. Eventually. The first half is a little annoying. There's a lot of chronological foofarah - skipping all over the place for no pressing reason - and a ginormous cast it's hard to keep track of, and our super-omniscient narrator often takes time out to tell you some trivial character's entire life story, which you didn't really need. But the second half ratchets up the tension to pure shit-your-pantsville, as that sprawling cast all meet their assorted fates. It makes up for some irritation in the first half. So yeah, as a novel it's excellent. The authenticity issue, I bring up mostly because we take this book seriously; it won a Pulitzer. It deserves to be looked carefully at. I looked carefully and I was confused by its truth."

        "text":"Despite some luminous moments where the characters come alive in a special way, this novel about the lives of slaves in a fictional community in Virginia of the 1830s felt too hermetic and sealed off for me to enjoy it as thoroughly as others might. The special hook that the story holds is its rendering of freed blacks who became slave owners themselves. The focus is on one such plantation with about 30 slaves which is struggling to adapt to the death of its black master, Henry Townsend. We get a plausible history along the way of how his father, Augustus, was so talented at furniture making that he bought his own freedom, and state legislative action allowed him to continue residing in the state and eventually bought the freedom of his son. With other free blacks, such as the feisty, condescending teacher Fern, who came from the North, they form a small society of their own. While Augustus abhors slavery, his son tries to emulate the path taken by the whites to economic success by owning slaves. Despite an ambition to become a benevolent master, the corrupting influence of owning people as property is well portrayed. When his lonely widow takes up a love relationship with her plantation foreman, she is replicating the same abuse of power enacted by most other white plantation owners, and the consequences are tragic. The “known world” of plantation life in this fictional county is like an island in time, and the characters themselves seem stuck in it like insects in amber. The omniscient narrator is god-like in passing into the thoughts and dreams of more than a dozen characters. Unfortunately, the reader gets distanced from emotionally connecting to them by the narrator breaking the flow to leap backward and forward in time to reveal some particular fact or person’s fate (for more see: D.D. Wood review ). Ultimately, the human bonds holding people to each other came off as tenuous and unreal as beholding a ship in a bottle. Unlike the romanticized lives portrayed in Hailey’s “Roots”, the characters have no sense of cultural history of their African origins (the word itself appears nowhere in the book), and there is no foreshadowing of plantation life as a doomed phase in history on the path to the Civil War. The idea of a slave revolt is unthinkable, and the one humane white character, Sheriff Skiffington, feels no compunction over diligently carrying out a big part of his job in organizing night patrols and retrieval efforts when “property” runs away. Though we get no sense of the reality of the “Underground Railroad”, we do get a brilliant vision at one point where Augustus ends up mailing a slave girl to Philadelphia in a crate along with a shipment of his hand-carved walking sticks. In an interview with Jones appended to the audiobook version of the novel, he admits he did not do much research for the book and was not concerned about communicating any particular message to his readers about the history of slavery. As the creator of all the characters, he would not admit to favoring any one character over another. Still the reader can’t help but getting the message of how inhumane slavery was and how individuals trapped in it strived to achieve some form of dignity in their lives. Like other reviewers, I didn’t feel I got to know any of the characters well enough to get emotionally engaged with them. When not interrupted by invasions from the narrator, the prose is effective in evoking the place and time, an obvious factor in helping it gain a Pulitzer Prize. Here is a lovely example from the opening for the book: The evening his master dies he worked again well after he ended the day for the other adults, his own wife among them, and sent them back with hunger and tiredness to their cabins. The young ones, his son among them, had been sent out of the fields an hour or so before the adults, to prepare the late supper and, if there was time enough, to play in a few minutes of sun that were left. When he, Moses, finally freed himself of the ancient and brittle harness that connected him to the oldest mule his master owned, all that was left of the sun was a five-inch long memory of red orange laid out in still waves across the horizon between two mountains on the left and one on the right. He had been in the fields for all of fourteen hours. He paused before leaving the fields as the evening quiet wrapped itself about him. The mule quivered, wanting home and rest. Moses closed his eyes and bent down and took a pinch of the soil and ate it with no more thought than if it were a spot of cornbread. …he ate it not only to discover the strengths and weaknesses of the field, but because eating it tied him to the only thing in his small world that meant almost as much as his own life."

        "text":"Glorious account that gets past cliches. The premise is that two slaves in 1840s Virginia bought their freedom, but their son stayed a little too long under the master's care. What does the family do when the son starts his own farm and buys his own slaves? The mastery of Jones' writing comes in the sense of history that he lends to minute objects, chance encounters, and incantatory reveries within a frought landscape. Not content to write an unwritten history of forgotten people, Jones re-writes the histories that have been written, citing documents the purport to explain the historical phenomenon of free blacks who owned slaves. Passages that carry runaway characters to the north also tie in academic treatises from the next century, deeds and warrants and court decisions that attempted to justify white supremacy, and the momentoes that emancipated children carry to their deathbeds. Jones doesn't neglect to include tales of individual transformation, collective redemption, or international implications in this epic. Characters may come and go like fleeting ghosts, yet the marks they leave may remain. When the words of the plantation master and deeds of the escaped overseer have faded into ineffectual memory, we readers are left with both the sense that an institution has gone horribly wrong and that the people within it can be honorably right; even if the results remain unapparent, the promise of future change remains, along with the threat of complacency and neglect. Jones didn't attempt to detail the national debate over slavery that was current at that time. That limitation on his project was probably a good one. It allows us to see the human effects that rhetoric had covered, and allowed him to devote his attentions to demonstrating the range of positions that people could occupy in relation to the institution. Yes, whether you're descended from a slave, a master, a freed man, a black woman passing as white, an unwilling overseer, a treacherous deputy, a conscientious drunk, or an immigrant Irishwoman sold into prostitution, there's something in this book for you - and I wish that I was only joking, but the irony is that there is no irony here, and sincerity is the least of what we have to do, and memory is only the start of making a history that hasn't stopped."

The novel chronicles his life, the lives of his family members, and the lives of people he encountered in the community. The main characters are three-dimensional and feel like real people, with both admirable traits and flaws. Jones employs an omniscient narrator and non-linear storytelling. He weaves together overlapping stories of past and present events, such that the reader knows what happens to these people in the future before knowing what has happened to them in the book’s “present.” There are a great many characters in this book and the list of Dramatis Personae is helpful in keeping them all straight. This novel is based on a lesser known historical fact. While it was not common, it did happen that some free blacks owned slaves. It lends a complexity to the slavery narrative – showing how people can be impacted by society’s strictures and how victims of exploitation could become perpetrators of the same system. This is not a quick and easy read. It feels like being immersed in the life and times of Manchester County, Virginia, in the 1850s. It is an eloquently written condemnation of oppression in any form. This book won the Pulitzer Prize in 2004."

(i know, i know. this is fiction. a novel. get over it. but it was just kinda weird to me. social commentary inserted into fiction happens. steinbeck did it. teju cole does it. many writers do this. i felt like jones did a crap-ton of research for this book. but then i read this NPR piece . in it, he notes he collected 2 shelves worth of books on slavery... \"but never got around to reading them\" . so this just added to my 'what the?' on the references in the novel and jones' research.) * all of this combined for a really awkward flow, and convoluted storytelling. i felt like it could lose 50-100 pages and be a tighter, better story. in case you think maybe i am a lazy reader - i'm not, i swear! i love nothing more than a meaty, tough read. jones' story is definitely both of these things. he explores the issue of free black people owning slaves in virginia, and he gives us a large cast of active characters. but it all felt so... surface-y. we get the actions and reactions, but we don't really get the motivations or emotions. jones is navigating a morally dodgy landscape, one i would have loved to have gone into more deeply. we are given the horrors and the heartbreaks, but it all felt so detached. and, you know, maybe that is totally on purpose. maybe, for some people, detachment is the only way through such a horrible time in history. jones has collected some serious critical acclaim and recognition over his career. to name a few: he's won the pulitzer, the national book critic's circle award, the PEN\/Hemingway award, a MacArthur genius grant, and the International IMPAC dublin literary award. he's won nearly $1 million in literary awards alone. the man knows what he's doing, and the respect he's earned is fairly universal. the known world is an important story. but is just shining the light on the issues jones raises enough? so now i am back to the should . i should love this book. (it was just okay for me.) people should read this book. (indeed. but this is not a book i will blanket recommend to all.) so, i don't know you guys. i am bummed over this one. and this is a terrible review\/collection of thoughts. maybe i'll become more coherent with some distance and fix this up a bit - but for now i wanted to note down something here. (aside #1 (going to be a bit spoiler-y here): moses confused me. or, rather, his turn to all-of-a-sudden being an asshole was weird. we're going along with moses. he seems like a lovely man. then, halfway into the book, he's a wife-beater, jerkface? where did that come from, and why was he presented like that? the reveal of moses being a not nice man was sudden and odd.) (aside #2: worth noting (was hugely interesting to me) - the cover photo of this edition is © Eudora Welty ! i had no idea about her photographic prowess .)"

On top of that, the book has won all sorts of prizes: *Pulitzer Prize for Fiction (2004) *International Dublin Literary Award (2005) *Anisfield-Wolf Book Award (2004) *National Book Critics Circle Award for Fiction (2003) * Hurston\/Wright Legacy Award Nominee for Debut Fiction (\/2004 *National Book Award Finalist for Fiction (2003) I knew I had to give it a try. I am glad I have read it, but to say I like it, would just not be true. It’s OK, so I am giving it two stars. There is no real central character to the story, because he dies right off the bat. It is 1855 when Henry Townsend dies. He is black. He had been a slave, but his parents had bought him his freedom. He leaves behind no children but a wife, Caldonia, a twenty-eight-year-old educated black woman born free, and his property of thirty-three slaves and fifty acres in Manchester County, Virginia. The book is about the hell that breaks loose afterwards, but really what it is about is life in the South during the antebellum era, about the mindset of Blacks and Whites of this era. The story is told by an omniscient narrator—who knows how each character thinks, what has happened to all of them in the past and what will happen to all of them in the future. It is this all-seeing narrator that shapes the entire feel of the story. This narrator knows everything, but he is not particularly adept at cogently telling a story. In one sentence you may switch form the present to the future and back again. In the next sentence you flip back to the past. It is easy to become confused. Character upon character is thrown at you, with little tidbits about their lives in the past, present and future. You are given an entire community of individuals—Whites and Blacks, a Native American or two, those who are free and those who are slaves, a sheriff and his deputy. The omniscient narrator is constantly restating who each one is, which is good in one sense, but the flow of the tale becomes jerky. Stop and start, backward and forward and often confusing. Use of the omniscient narrator is pushed to the extreme. It is kind of nice to have a character or two to guide you through a story. You do not have that here. There are a whole group of characters, characters that are hard to attach yourself to. You do not get close to any one individual. In the afterword the author points out that he wanted to draw characters that were neither all good nor all bad, each one different in their own way. You do get that here, but you fail to feel anything for any of them. What you do get is a strong sense of being one of a large community. You are there, one among many, living in the antebellum South. This does give one a hands-on feeling of life then and there and how people were thinking. Kevin Free narrates the audiobook. It is simple to follow, the speed is fine and he intonations are well done. The narration performance is good so I have given the narration three stars."

I don't remember which book I suggested then, but I recall one woman in particular who really loved this book (or I believe she was more in love with Edward Jones' writing). At the end of the workshop we had a gift exchange raffle and she included this book as her contribution. I was the lucky recipient of this free copy. I was interested in this historical novel set in a fictional place in Virginia during the antebellum era, about a former slave who ends up owning slaves. The strangeness of the story and the angle it takes as a slave narrative is intriguing. Also appealing is the way the omniscient narration allows the reader to approach the story without the moral judgement one reserves for this kind of story, since the distance of the narration allows one to realize quickly what the story tries to showcase: how slavery has already poisoned the integrity of all involved. The framework of the novel is composed of anecdotal stories within stories, with pacing often interrupted for a mini scene or two, or an introduction of yet another character who may reappear later or simply disappear. Put another way, it is a book of puzzle pieces: one is added, taken away, another picked up, oh yes, there's the whole, whoops, maybe not, here goes another piece. So although I admired the writing and story setup in the beginning, I just was not in the right space to complete this novel. It has been a while since I added a book to my \"did-not-finish\" list; alas, this one has just made the list. This is not a failed attempt at reading this novel, however, because I remember not being able to finish Ngugi wa Thiong'o's Wizard of the Crow only to later fall in love with his novel, Petals of Blood . With that in mind, I look forward to reading Jones' Lost in the City ."

While not exactly removing race from the issue of slavery, Jones is able to show that even among African-Americans the perniciousness of slavery could damn a generation. The best summary of this idea came from a NYTimes review: 'There are few certified villains in this novel, white or black, because slavery poisons moral judgments at the root. As Jones shows, slavery corrupts good intentions and underwrites bad ones, yet allows decency the odd occasion -- but only by creating such an enormous need for it.' The pacing and structure of this novel could be a little challenging to some, but I found that it fit the narrative perfectly. This isn't a novel that burns you with its quotable sentences, but it scars you with its images. There were periods in it where I thought I was reading a Cormac McCarthy novel. That alone is high praise."

        "text":"When Toni Morrison began her research for \"Beloved,\" she discovered a trove of ghastly instruments. She knew, of course, that slaves were routinely whipped, starved, raped, and hanged, but the existence of specially forged tools was a surprise: metal bits forced down the throat, iron masks locked across the face, spiked collars clasped around the neck. Her Pulitzer Prize-winning novel reintroduced those horrors into the national memory and did much to demonstrate that the cruelties of slavery extended far beyond hard labor and physical deprivation. \"The Known World,\" by Edward Jones, reclaims another peculiarity of American slavery and in the process illustrates yet again that we can't under- estimate its perverse contortions of the human spirit. Bizarre as it sounds, in Louisiana, Virginia, and South Carolina, a small number of free blacks owned their own plantations - and their own slaves. It was a precarious arrangement, to be sure. Blacks who were freed or managed to buy their own freedom had little incentive to tarry in the South. The laws governing their status and their right to hold property were ambiguous and easy for any white person to shred. Jones uses this fragile situation as the setting for a novel about a group of black and white Virginians who tried - sometimes nobly, often viciously - to maintain their world in the face of inevitable collapse. To the extent that Morrison spun a surreal tale of American slavery into mythic proportions, Jones has carved a companion series of stark anecdotes into national legends. In a measured voice that never rises to reflect the agonies and absurdities he describes, he moves back and forth through decades and across state lines, assembling an apparently random collection of brief scenes that gradually fuse into a stunning portrait of moral confusion. The story revolves around Henry Townsend, a black man who, with the indulgence of his former owner, managed to buy his own farm and his own slaves - eventually 29 adults and a collection of children. Henry's parents, who labored tirelessly to free him as a child, are horrified by his participation in the flesh market, but Henry is ambitious, and, what's more, he learned from his master that \"once you own even one, you will never be alone.\" As a protection against loneliness and a way to wealth, Henry can't imagine anything more successful, and he's convinced he can be \"a better master than any white man he had ever known.\" Indeed, he attains that dubious goal, creating a plantation with forced labor that's largely free of physical beatings, but it's an insidious gentility that only camouflages the humiliations of Southern slavery. Nevertheless, his untimely death frightens most of his slaves, who know just how delicate their relative comfort is. Only the brooding overseer, Moses, the first slave Henry ever bought, sees his master's demise as an opportunity - not for freedom, but for taking his place. Indeed, what interests Jones most in this complex novel is the way slavery distorts judgment, not just of those who oppress, but of those who are oppressed. Henry's widow, Caldonia, quickly decides against freeing \"her legacy,\" choosing instead to maintain the plantation in the spirit of Henry's gentle example. \"Her husband had done the best he could,\" she thinks, \"and on Judgment Day his slaves would stand before God and testify to that fact.\" Occasionally, a child is worked to death or a pregnant woman labors in the field till she miscarries, but Caldonia sheds sincere tears, comforts the parents, and considers whether she should buy insurance against further losses of her property. As a single woman with a large business to run, she's encouraged by a collection of family and friends, other free blacks, some of whom own their own slaves, too. One of the most troubling is Fern, Caldonia's prim teacher of literature and etiquette. Together, they keep the irony of their position well buried, while socializing in a kind of racial terrarium maintained by William Robbins, the county's wealthiest white farmer. Estranged from his own wife but protected by his political power, he loves a black woman in town and openly adores his two mulatto children. The Townsend plantation with its little coterie of free slave-owning blacks gives his favorites a place to play and refine themselves. In one of several shifts to the late 19th century, a Canadian historian interviews Fern, Caldonia's teacher, about those days on the plantation. \"All of us do only what the law and God tell us we can do,\" she says without any hint of guilt or remorse. \"We owned slaves. It was what was done, and so that is what we did.\" Jones uses that same tone of historical distance throughout, a tone that amplifies the grotesque mingling of affection and cruelty that infected these people, black and white. In the center of this moral kaleidoscope stands the sheriff, John Skiffington, an earnest Christian, dedicated to the objective application of law and convinced that \"the law always cares\" for everyone equally. It's a doomed endeavor, of course, but as Caldonia's plantation begins to collapse, Skiffington fails to realize that the legal system he's sworn to uphold is not objective and that he cannot remain clean within it. The scrambled collection of events and characters makes this a difficult story to enter, but that structure eventually accounts for much of the novel's evocative power. Jones has a kind of biblical style that suggests whole lives in a few stark details from a perspective that's alternately microscopic and telescopic. It's a technique that resists our efforts to keep these events in some unrecoverable past. The troubling implications of his story leach in through hairline cracks all over the twin shells of antebellum nostalgia and Northern piety. Every time Caldonia cheerfully reminds her friends, \"We are all worthy of one another,\" the legacy of slavery sounds more complex and unresolved. http:\/\/www.csmonitor.com\/2003\/0814\/p1..."

Just another thing that I did not learn in American history. This book had many characters but the characters were not overwhelming. The characters involve a man who worked hard to buy his freedom and eventually the freedom of his wife and later their child only to see their child prosper and purchase slaves for himself. The book also focuses on his slaves and their relationships. There is also the sheriff and his wife who are given a slave girl as a wedding gift even though they are against slavery they raise her and think of her as their \"child\" All of these stories come together in The Known World."

After reading The Known World, however, you'd be forgiven if you thought you could take a tour of it's plantations and slave cemetaries on your vacation to colonial Williamsburg. The complicated pre-civil war Southern society that Edward P. Jones creates feels as real and surreal as any factual history of slavery you've read. It was not so much the story of Henry Townsend, a black slave owner, and all the people that his death allows us to meet that engaged me. It was the world, a world where I could taste the soil I might till and the women I might marry and the terrible choices I might be faced with, that put it's claws in me and refused to let go. It took me nearly 2 months to finish the book's 388 pages. It should've been a quick read. It is a fascinating place with peculiar problems and characters I cried for on more than one occasion. It should've been a quick read but I kept asking myself this question: who would I have been? The slave, toiling away in the field? The overseer, unable to see the world for what it truly was? The freed man, working desperately to free the rest of his family? The smart child, taken under the wing of the rich white slave owner and convinced that there was nothing wrong with owning another human being? The broken black man tortured by his family's wealth built on the backs of men and women that look just like me? The slave too proud, too strong, too powerful to let another take his freedom? Who would I have been? Who am I now? In matters of race, there is always that fool's point, usually made by a white person (though not always) that asks,\"why aren't you over it, already? Can't we just let it go?\" It is a way to end an uncomfortable conversation. The reasons don't matter. I know many a person for which the sticky tar baby of race in America is simply a discussion they can't stick their hands in. It is too difficult. Too raw. Too cloudy to be sure that people will remain friends after an honest chat. The way I feel when I read books like The Known World is my answer. No matter how well-adjusted, how integrated, how loving of my fellow man, how multiculti kumbayah I am, I'm not over it. I can't let it go. This fictional world was very real not all that long ago. It's effects still ripple through our every day. The world I know doesn't exist without it. Highly highly recommended."

        "text":"I know this is a critically acclaimed book, a Pulitzer winner, and a book tackling a difficult and complex stain on America history: slavery and black slave owners. There are moments when the book does say some interesting things or reveal some unsavory and uncomfortable truths, but it was so hard to engage with as a reader. I mean, I hung in with DFW through the first 600 pages of Infinite Jest where nothing happens -- but because I was fascinated by Hal, Orin, Marathe, Steeply, and Mario and Madame Psychosis who all fascinated me. There were literally dozens of other characters but these all pulled me in. In The Known World, there are also dozens of characters but none that I grew any attachment too. It was as if the author Jones was using a hand-held camera and no stabilizer so that the images were jumpy and out of focus. It reminded me sometimes of how the world seems to my myopic eyes between taking off my glasses in the morning and putting in my contact lenses. The narration also highly annoyed me. All the parenthetical \"in 60 years so and so will do such as such\" were meaningless because I was given neither enough time nor enough detail to give a shit. Further, there is this reference to \"years later they would all turn into human torches in front of the dry foods store\", but no mention afterwards of to what this referred. But the most annoying bit was in using the Canadian journalist frame at about page 130 or so (which then only briefly appears in the narrative 200 pages later in a parenthetical throwaway comment, it is said that the journalist would never marry his heart's desire yet 3 pages later, they marry and that coming to talk to Fern that there was some incomprehensible stuff that happens off-screen that morning (also never adequately explained) and so she was not going to open up to the journalist and yet we still find her filling in details about Henry, Moses and Caledonia 30 pages later. Too much inconsistency - was the editor asleep or stoned and missed these? So, despite taking on a complex subject, Jones is no Faulkner as his South does not eve approach that of the Great William. He is not as good as Pynchon or DFW is manipulating time and space in a narrative that was 100 or 150 pages too long and felt it, and he is not Alice Walker or Toni Morrison who brought us the most amazing, poignant, and powerful images of slavery and its residual impacts generations later that I have ever read. So, read Beloved or Absalom, Absalom if you want to hear about the South and I expect you will be less frustrated, but every bit enraged at this deplorable institution that is a cancer on the American past."

        "text":"Ambitious, Interesting, Disorganized In an interview, Edward P. Jones revealed that The Known World took shape around 1) when he heard that Black people had owned slaves and 2) when he read a thin paperback in high school about a Jewish man who decided to join the Nazi party, how he acted in opposition to how one would expect. The Known World is an ambitious novel which aims to describe the world of 1855 where Henry Townsend has recently died. As a result of his death, a cloud of uncertainty hangs in the air as he leaves behind his widow, Caldonia, and the undetermined fate of the slaves he purchased to work his land. Although the plot is interesting, this book is disorganized. It covers many different characters and rapidly shifts time periods. I would be reading along and then the text would say “and this person lived to be 93 years old and had 235 grandchildren.” (paraphrasing) Countless times, I had to stop and reread because the storytelling was so clunky. In The Known World, there are quite a few references to Adam and Eve, even references to Milton (Paradise Lost). My favorite author, Philip Pullman, loves to talk about this topic and how in his works he wanted his characters to find their way back to The Garden by taking the long way around. So this quote on page 329 stood out: “There was a long way around but he chose not to take it.” There is a character in The Known World by the name of Anderson Frazier. He creates and distributes pamphlets and interviews Fern Elston. In my opinion, this pamphlet could have provided a framework to systematically organize the characters instead of the resulting jumbled and confusing soup of characters and timelines. The Known World has some unforgettable moments, but the organization of the narrative reduces the enjoyment of the reading experience.

        "text":"This is a complex novel, with dense writing, a non-linear structure, and an abundance of characters. It reads much like a true historical account of a place, Manchester County, Virginia, and time, pre-Civil War 1800s. This could very nearly have passed for a non-fiction book; each character feels so real, their personal stories and histories so authentic. The author even goes so far as to tell us what happens to many of them ten, twenty or even fifty years in the future. And yet, Edward P. Jones himself states: \"The county and town of Manchester, Virginia, and every human being in those places, are products of my imagination… The census records I made up for Manchester were, again, simply to make the reader feel that the town and the county and the people lived and breathed in central Virginia once upon a time…\" Well, consider me duped. At first I really thought such a county existed and the data presented were genuine facts. As my son passed through the living room, I even shouted out some sort of statistic or another and asked if he had ever read about such a thing in his history classes. He couldn’t recall, but it sounded ‘familiar’. Right, because much of this could have been true, yet it wasn’t. The institution of slavery of course was all too real and cruel, and that’s what this book is about, and this is the truth. Slavery in all its forms is evil. Henry Townsend is a black farmer. He is a former slave that with the purchase of freedom and some land becomes a slave owner himself. Henry and his wife Caldonia own a small plantation near the border of his former master’s much larger one. I could not wrap my head around why on earth a freed man would ever want to enslave another human being. Henry and other black slave owners like him justify their actions: \"Henry had always said that he wanted to be a better master than any white man he had ever known. He did not understand that the kind of world he wanted to create was doomed before he had even spoken the first syllable of the word master.\" Well, as the old saying goes, ‘the road to hell is paved with good intentions.’ When Henry dies, all hell breaks loose, and we begin to see the ill-fated consequences of an institution that is immoral and corrupt. A narrative that seems to jump around in time and between characters eventually comes together into a whole as consequences and events snowball out of control. Lives are permanently changed. Some for the worst, others (we hope) for the better. They all become woven together much like the massive tapestry hanging on the wall of another place in another time. Each is part of the story. Everyone is responsible for the events which passed, were allowed to pass despite the huge injustice to humanity. This book is not easy to read. The structure is challenging and the topic is gloomy, albeit important. What happens to the people we grow to care for is often horrifying and heartbreaking. But it is well-written and extremely impactful. An important novel which is well worth your time and attention if you are up for the challenge. It won't suit everyone, but if you are at all interested, I encourage you to pick this one up. \"What I feared most at that moment is what I still fear: that they would remember my history, that I, no matter what I had always said to the contrary, owned people of our Race.\""

Because there is a lot of life and death in this take on pre-Civil War Virginia. I knew little about the book except that the author wrote it after reading about freed Black folks owning slaves. In delving into this issue, which in any modern conversation circle must bring dissonance, disbelief, and maybe even disgust, I became increasingly moved and disturbed. A difficult book, both because it’s an unflinching look at slavery, but also because it’s written in a James Joyce-ish style — lots of asides and stream of consciousness text. The author careens from generation to generation and back again in often the same paragraph. Yet it worked for me. It reads like a memoir of an entire county’s 150-year history complete with dozens of families represented. What results is simply, UNFORGETTABLE. There are characters whose faces I imagined while reading and characters whose stories I became invested in that will haunt me. Not in the truth of a fictional characterization but more because the ugliness of humanity was so blatantly on display and sadly remains real to this day. As I bid farewell to the slaves, slaveowners, children of both and ministers, sheriffs and patrollers of this novel, I will not forget their names. And I can’t help but wonder who would I have been in Manchester County, Virginia? (Reviewed 2\/12\/25)"

        "text":"I'm going to have to rave a bit, because this is one of the best books I've read in the past ten years. Jones packs in all the historical detail you could want, and of course he's hit on a subject--black slaveowners--that in and of itself is tabloid-sensational. Where lesser writers might lean too hard on the sensational aspect (or rely on it to bolster an otherwise weak narrative), Jones works it into a compelling and powerful story. What makes it so powerful is a mix of fascinating characters who are woven into a series of overlapping plotlines. For me it's the structuring that is so brilliant (geek alert: I actually diagrammed the time shifts in the chapters as an exercise, to see when and how Jones yoked the whole thing together). This less than linear approach might be frustrating to those who just want things to be straightforward, but stick with it: the shifts provide suspense as well as texture, and they propel more than one storyline at once. They do all come together, trust me. I also admire the overarching authorial voice in the novel, which certainly leans toward the formal, but also comes across as aware of the history it's grappling with: here and there Jones projects his voice forward for a moment, or seemingly digresses with factual material and research. Again it's all part of the tapestry and the mix, and I also think that the level of narrative awareness (which never disengages long enough to derail anything) adds another layer to the very idea of history--making the whole historical and contemporary both. And for those of you who can do without all of the above writerly blather (a thousand pardons), you'll find in this book characters who are engaging, ignorant, cruel, earnest, sympathetic, tragic, hopeful, flawed--in short, complicated. Halfway through you'll be fighting off the impulse to skip ahead to learn everyone's fate. Finally, I'll say that this book isn't perfect--there are aspects of what I've described above that sometimes don't work: narrative turns that do seem pointless digressions, a character or two a bit stereotypical or annoying. No matter. This book aims high, as brilliant works of art do, and the result is nothing short of amazing."

        "text":"This book demands that you read it slowly and intently. Like eating a huge Thanksgiving dinner, you need to pause and digest before you have the next course. At the outset, the plot seems to be all over the place, bouncing from character to character, telling too many stories, not telling enough and then seeming to tell too much. Ah, but then, you make a little progress and the rhythm begins to assert itself, the stories begin to weave together, the minute details begin to become a diorama, the picture stops being a blur and comes into sharp focus. This isn’t one man’s story, or even the story of one place, this is the story of all men and this is the tale of a world. This book is not so much about race as it is about the abject insanity and evil of the institution of slavery, wherever it is found, whoever is practicing it. In this system, there are free black masters holding black slaves, some of them well-meaning, but it does not make the practice any less immoral. There are white men who love their black mistresses and the children they bear, but it does not remove the fact that they hold a dominion over them that is not borne of love in any of its guises. There are also individuals who are victims of the system and others who refuse to be victims of the system, even at the cost of their lives. I loved many of Jones’ characters, notably Augustus and Mildred Townsend. They exemplify what is the best in us. I felt sorry for some of them, like Sheriff John Skiffington, who would like to be better than this society allows him to be, and Caldonia Townsend’s brother, Calvin, who wishes to go to New York so that he will not have to bear witness to the cruelties around him, cruelties he must realized have escaped him only because of a trick of fortune. I despised some of them, and I recognized most of them. The petty and jealous, who must have dominion over someone to feel they have worth; the ungrateful and traitorous, who would turn upon a friend to put some silver in their own pockets; the meek and hopeless, who bow to the yoke and try simply to find a corner in which they are allowed to exist; the defiant and strong-minded, who fight with their last breath because to do otherwise is to prop up the indefensible; all are here. What I loved most about this novel is its genuineness, its lack of exaggeration or hyperbole, where surely none is needed, its emphasis on the day-to-day injustice of an institution that is accepted as insurmountable or even correct only because it is what is. Edward P. Jones has leveled an attack at the heart of mankind and defied one to imagine what they would have done, what they would have dared to do, in such a place and time."

But they're just the start - the book is really a series of stories & vignettes about the families, friends, neighbors & community surrounding Henry & Caldonia. It took me a really long time to get into the book, because there are so many characters, some important & some not, & the book jumps around in time, making it difficult to follow. Trust me, use the cast of characters at the end of this edition (why not place this at the beginning?!) & give up your expectations about traditional narrative format, & you'll LOVE this book as much as I did. In life, we have our own story kind of playing in our head, & at the same time we have all these other stories we're hearing - the story about your mother's great-uncle. The story about your brother in law's neighbor. The one about your sister's husband's aunt & her neighbor. the one about your coworker's mother. You know all those stories? That's what this book is like - some characters are more important than others, so you hear more of their stories, but minor characters have stories too, & they sort of appear out of nowhere, & you get to hear their story, & then they're gone. It's really very cool! I particularly loved the story of the womanizing slave who has a vision during a lightning storm\/tornado - & becomes the founder of an orphanage. And the little tiny story about the family who don't want to give up their cow, & the woman goes into the barn to milk the cow & there's this lovely description of her squirting the cow's milk into a cat's mouth, & if you've ever seen a cat eat with true contentment you will recognize the cat body language that Jones describes. Toward the end of the book there's a very powerful scene where a character, who isn't a particularly \"good\" character, says there should be a lantern or light of truth in the world, an actual place where people can stand & tell the truth without fear of retribution, where one might be able to right a wrong. It's a moment where you think, yes this guy could right the wrong by speaking out, because his fear of having people think he's \"on the negro's side\" is...well, wrong! But that's his fear & in that moment of the book you understand it & you think, yeah, what if he could speak out under that light of truth & not have anyone judge him? How wonderful would that be? While the book depicts the horrors of slavery, & there are a few characters who are outright despicable, there are many shades of gray in Jones' vision as well. It's a book that will make you think about slavery, the myths & realities & tragedies of it all, & on top of that it'll make you think about your own life & all the people you've known & how complex & interesting we all are, really. It's beautifully written & the characters will stick in your head as if you'd known them too. Oddly, I think what I initially disliked most about this book - its multitude of characters & convoluted timeline - is what I ended up really enjoying! Another example of a book that made my head expand, with some creakiness, but I'm glad the expansion can still happen!"

        "text":"In this book I learned that there used to be black slaveholders in the US. I thought that only white people were allowed to own slaves during the time that owning slaves were like owning properties. During that pre-Abolition time. During those sad dark days in the American history. Black Edward P. Jones (born 1951) wrote this historical epic novel, The Known World based on the not well known fact that there were some black slaveholders (black people owning black slaves) in the state of Virginia during the time in the US when owning slave is legal. Wikipedia has this to say: \"Slavery in the United States was a form of unfree labor which existed as a legal institution in North America for more than a century before the founding of the United States in 1776, and continued mostly in the South until the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution in 1865.[1] The first English colony in North America, Virginia, first imported Africans in 1619, a practice earlier established in the Spanish colonies as early as the 1560s.[2] Most slaves were black and were held by whites, although some Native Americans and free blacks also held slaves; there were a small number of white slaves as well.[3]\" Winner of the 2004 Pulitzer Award for Fiction, The Known World is one of the most memorable reads I had this year. It is not an easy book to read. This 388-page novel left me with a heavy chest each time I closed the book. Each page is gloomy and sad. The novel is well-told with lyrical prose creating a big canvas of imagery in one's mind while reading. In that big canvas are memorable and three-dimensional numerous characters most of them black slaves. No character is downright bad or good. The detailed description of the sceneries of a fictional county called Manchester and the true depictions of the characters are exceptionally striking that I had to slow down in my reading to savor the story and hold on *tugging to them, cheering them on* to each characters. Reading the last page left me with a heavy heart. I would not want to let go of that image of Manchester and say goodbye Please don't go yet to the characters that I already became part of my literary world. The world that resides in the recesses of my brain. The world that is known only to me populated by people who I met only in my readings. In terms of writing, Jones extensively use the technique called prolepsis that I first encountered reading Muriel Sparks' The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie (1961). Jones explained this in the interview (appendix of the book) saying that he is the God of those characters so he knows what happened in the life of each characters from the time he\/she was born up to the time his\/her death. The most moving example of this use was with the character of the child Tessie . One fine day of September 1855, their mistress Caldonia saw the 5-y\/o Tessie playing with a wooden toy horse. Caldonia says to the child: That is very nice, Tessie to which Tessie responded, My papa did this for me . In January 2002, on her deathbed, the old Tessie asked her caretaker to get the wooden toy horse from the attic. While holding the toy, she breathed her last saying the same thing: My papa did this for me . My heart stopped beating. Tears welled up in my eyes. That scene is just one of the many moving scenes about those slaves in that time of the history in Virginia when black people were traded like they were not human but properties. I can make this review very long. There are just too many good things I would like to say here but I am afraid that no review can make justice to a book as good as this."

        "text":"Jar Of Death Pick #28 3.5 Stars Most people probably believe that the only people who owned slaves were white people. But that's actually not the truth. Free blacks owned other black people. Some free blacks bought their family members and others just wanted the slave labor. Native Americans owned slaves for much of the same reasons. The Known World introduces us to some of those people. The Known World has won a whole gang of awards, so we know its an important book and the writing is top notch. My only problems with the book were the fact that there were too many characters. You know this is a pet peeve of mine and I lost track of all the characters in this book. My other problem was that it jumped backwards and forwards in time way too much. Most of the time jumps were super confusing. I liked The Known World but I think I might not be smart enough to read this book. I'll probably reread it sometime in the future and I do recommend to others because its a brilliant book."

However, any plot that might exist was buried so deep beneath the convoluted chronology and extraneous characters and details that I decided I didn't care to keep digging for it, and quit on page 198. The author seemed determined to insert every existing anecdote about slavery into one novel. This might have worked better as a compilation of essays or short stories."

        "text":"The Known World does this weird thing: it cites its sources. And it's weird because they don't exist. There are passages like this: [Manchester, VA] went through a period of years and years of what University of Virginia historian Roberta Murphy in a 1948 book would call 'peace and prosperity'. Jones goes on to tell you the publication history of that book, and a few more things about what was in it, and to imply that Roberta Murphy was a little racist. But there is no Roberta Murphy, there is no book, there is no Manchester, VA. What is Jones up to? Wyatt Mason notes : What research on the subject Jones undertook was, in fact, quickly derailed after he happened upon an account of a white slave owner who spent her days abusing one of her black slaves, a little girl, by beating her head against a wall. “If I had wanted to tell the whole story of slavery, Americans couldn’t have taken that,” Jones told an interviewer. “People want to think that there was slavery, and then we got beyond it. People don’t want to hear that a woman would take a child and bang her head against the wall day after day. It’s nice that I didn’t read all those books. What I would have had to put down is far, far harsher and bleaker. Too much of a bummer? It's not that The Known World is a feel-good novel. Ears and Achilles tendons will be sliced. It follows the rules of slavery books: slave narratives always had happy endings; later, fictional slave narratives always have sad endings. But Toni Morrison has a different opinion about what Americans can and can't take. Shit, so does Harriet Jacobs. And Jones knows this, so he's being disingenuous. And you notice that he's talking about books he didn't actually read. NPR says, Jones collected two shelves of books about slavery, but never got around to reading them. Still, the author was able to use his imagination, and stories he had heard growing up, to make his characters come alive. \"I decided the people I'd created were real enough and I had just accumulated enough information about what the world was like in the South before 1865 to allow me to lie and get away with it,\" he says. Look, I don't mean to say Jones isn't telling the truth. I don't know if he is, and neither does he; neither of us read those two shelves of books about slavery. But the citation of imaginary sources in the book itself serves to either add authenticity that's undeserved, or - if you follow up on those sources - underline its lack of authenticity. I'm puzzled by it. This sort of meta-sourcing has been done before - by Nabokov in Pale Fire, by Cervantes, and in its closest parallel by Borges in his first collection, Universal History of Iniquity, which also confused me. It's especially jarring here, maybe just because I find the truth of slavery a fraught subject, and maybe because the layers go so deep - even in interviews about his lack of authenticity, he appears to be consciously inauthentic. I don't know, man, I don't get it. But anyway: is it a good made-up story about made-up people? Yeah, sure, totally. Eventually. The first half is a little annoying. There's a lot of chronological foofarah - skipping all over the place for no pressing reason - and a ginormous cast it's hard to keep track of, and our super-omniscient narrator often takes time out to tell you some trivial character's entire life story, which you didn't really need. But the second half ratchets up the tension to pure shit-your-pantsville, as that sprawling cast all meet their assorted fates. It makes up for some irritation in the first half. So yeah, as a novel it's excellent. The authenticity issue, I bring up mostly because we take this book seriously; it won a Pulitzer. It deserves to be looked carefully at. I looked carefully and I was confused by its truth."

        "text":"Despite some luminous moments where the characters come alive in a special way, this novel about the lives of slaves in a fictional community in Virginia of the 1830s felt too hermetic and sealed off for me to enjoy it as thoroughly as others might. The special hook that the story holds is its rendering of freed blacks who became slave owners themselves. The focus is on one such plantation with about 30 slaves which is struggling to adapt to the death of its black master, Henry Townsend. We get a plausible history along the way of how his father, Augustus, was so talented at furniture making that he bought his own freedom, and state legislative action allowed him to continue residing in the state and eventually bought the freedom of his son. With other free blacks, such as the feisty, condescending teacher Fern, who came from the North, they form a small society of their own. While Augustus abhors slavery, his son tries to emulate the path taken by the whites to economic success by owning slaves. Despite an ambition to become a benevolent master, the corrupting influence of owning people as property is well portrayed. When his lonely widow takes up a love relationship with her plantation foreman, she is replicating the same abuse of power enacted by most other white plantation owners, and the consequences are tragic. The “known world” of plantation life in this fictional county is like an island in time, and the characters themselves seem stuck in it like insects in amber. The omniscient narrator is god-like in passing into the thoughts and dreams of more than a dozen characters. Unfortunately, the reader gets distanced from emotionally connecting to them by the narrator breaking the flow to leap backward and forward in time to reveal some particular fact or person’s fate (for more see: D.D. Wood review ). Ultimately, the human bonds holding people to each other came off as tenuous and unreal as beholding a ship in a bottle. Unlike the romanticized lives portrayed in Hailey’s “Roots”, the characters have no sense of cultural history of their African origins (the word itself appears nowhere in the book), and there is no foreshadowing of plantation life as a doomed phase in history on the path to the Civil War. The idea of a slave revolt is unthinkable, and the one humane white character, Sheriff Skiffington, feels no compunction over diligently carrying out a big part of his job in organizing night patrols and retrieval efforts when “property” runs away. Though we get no sense of the reality of the “Underground Railroad”, we do get a brilliant vision at one point where Augustus ends up mailing a slave girl to Philadelphia in a crate along with a shipment of his hand-carved walking sticks. In an interview with Jones appended to the audiobook version of the novel, he admits he did not do much research for the book and was not concerned about communicating any particular message to his readers about the history of slavery. As the creator of all the characters, he would not admit to favoring any one character over another. Still the reader can’t help but getting the message of how inhumane slavery was and how individuals trapped in it strived to achieve some form of dignity in their lives. Like other reviewers, I didn’t feel I got to know any of the characters well enough to get emotionally engaged with them. When not interrupted by invasions from the narrator, the prose is effective in evoking the place and time, an obvious factor in helping it gain a Pulitzer Prize. Here is a lovely example from the opening for the book: The evening his master dies he worked again well after he ended the day for the other adults, his own wife among them, and sent them back with hunger and tiredness to their cabins. The young ones, his son among them, had been sent out of the fields an hour or so before the adults, to prepare the late supper and, if there was time enough, to play in a few minutes of sun that were left. When he, Moses, finally freed himself of the ancient and brittle harness that connected him to the oldest mule his master owned, all that was left of the sun was a five-inch long memory of red orange laid out in still waves across the horizon between two mountains on the left and one on the right. He had been in the fields for all of fourteen hours. He paused before leaving the fields as the evening quiet wrapped itself about him. The mule quivered, wanting home and rest. Moses closed his eyes and bent down and took a pinch of the soil and ate it with no more thought than if it were a spot of cornbread. …he ate it not only to discover the strengths and weaknesses of the field, but because eating it tied him to the only thing in his small world that meant almost as much as his own life."

        "text":"Glorious account that gets past cliches. The premise is that two slaves in 1840s Virginia bought their freedom, but their son stayed a little too long under the master's care. What does the family do when the son starts his own farm and buys his own slaves? The mastery of Jones' writing comes in the sense of history that he lends to minute objects, chance encounters, and incantatory reveries within a frought landscape. Not content to write an unwritten history of forgotten people, Jones re-writes the histories that have been written, citing documents the purport to explain the historical phenomenon of free blacks who owned slaves. Passages that carry runaway characters to the north also tie in academic treatises from the next century, deeds and warrants and court decisions that attempted to justify white supremacy, and the momentoes that emancipated children carry to their deathbeds. Jones doesn't neglect to include tales of individual transformation, collective redemption, or international implications in this epic. Characters may come and go like fleeting ghosts, yet the marks they leave may remain. When the words of the plantation master and deeds of the escaped overseer have faded into ineffectual memory, we readers are left with both the sense that an institution has gone horribly wrong and that the people within it can be honorably right; even if the results remain unapparent, the promise of future change remains, along with the threat of complacency and neglect. Jones didn't attempt to detail the national debate over slavery that was current at that time. That limitation on his project was probably a good one. It allows us to see the human effects that rhetoric had covered, and allowed him to devote his attentions to demonstrating the range of positions that people could occupy in relation to the institution. Yes, whether you're descended from a slave, a master, a freed man, a black woman passing as white, an unwilling overseer, a treacherous deputy, a conscientious drunk, or an immigrant Irishwoman sold into prostitution, there's something in this book for you - and I wish that I was only joking, but the irony is that there is no irony here, and sincerity is the least of what we have to do, and memory is only the start of making a history that hasn't stopped."

The novel chronicles his life, the lives of his family members, and the lives of people he encountered in the community. The main characters are three-dimensional and feel like real people, with both admirable traits and flaws. Jones employs an omniscient narrator and non-linear storytelling. He weaves together overlapping stories of past and present events, such that the reader knows what happens to these people in the future before knowing what has happened to them in the book’s “present.” There are a great many characters in this book and the list of Dramatis Personae is helpful in keeping them all straight. This novel is based on a lesser known historical fact. While it was not common, it did happen that some free blacks owned slaves. It lends a complexity to the slavery narrative – showing how people can be impacted by society’s strictures and how victims of exploitation could become perpetrators of the same system. This is not a quick and easy read. It feels like being immersed in the life and times of Manchester County, Virginia, in the 1850s. It is an eloquently written condemnation of oppression in any form. This book won the Pulitzer Prize in 2004."

(i know, i know. this is fiction. a novel. get over it. but it was just kinda weird to me. social commentary inserted into fiction happens. steinbeck did it. teju cole does it. many writers do this. i felt like jones did a crap-ton of research for this book. but then i read this NPR piece . in it, he notes he collected 2 shelves worth of books on slavery... \"but never got around to reading them\" . so this just added to my 'what the?' on the references in the novel and jones' research.) * all of this combined for a really awkward flow, and convoluted storytelling. i felt like it could lose 50-100 pages and be a tighter, better story. in case you think maybe i am a lazy reader - i'm not, i swear! i love nothing more than a meaty, tough read. jones' story is definitely both of these things. he explores the issue of free black people owning slaves in virginia, and he gives us a large cast of active characters. but it all felt so... surface-y. we get the actions and reactions, but we don't really get the motivations or emotions. jones is navigating a morally dodgy landscape, one i would have loved to have gone into more deeply. we are given the horrors and the heartbreaks, but it all felt so detached. and, you know, maybe that is totally on purpose. maybe, for some people, detachment is the only way through such a horrible time in history. jones has collected some serious critical acclaim and recognition over his career. to name a few: he's won the pulitzer, the national book critic's circle award, the PEN\/Hemingway award, a MacArthur genius grant, and the International IMPAC dublin literary award. he's won nearly $1 million in literary awards alone. the man knows what he's doing, and the respect he's earned is fairly universal. the known world is an important story. but is just shining the light on the issues jones raises enough? so now i am back to the should . i should love this book. (it was just okay for me.) people should read this book. (indeed. but this is not a book i will blanket recommend to all.) so, i don't know you guys. i am bummed over this one. and this is a terrible review\/collection of thoughts. maybe i'll become more coherent with some distance and fix this up a bit - but for now i wanted to note down something here. (aside #1 (going to be a bit spoiler-y here): moses confused me. or, rather, his turn to all-of-a-sudden being an asshole was weird. we're going along with moses. he seems like a lovely man. then, halfway into the book, he's a wife-beater, jerkface? where did that come from, and why was he presented like that? the reveal of moses being a not nice man was sudden and odd.) (aside #2: worth noting (was hugely interesting to me) - the cover photo of this edition is © Eudora Welty ! i had no idea about her photographic prowess .)"

On top of that, the book has won all sorts of prizes: *Pulitzer Prize for Fiction (2004) *International Dublin Literary Award (2005) *Anisfield-Wolf Book Award (2004) *National Book Critics Circle Award for Fiction (2003) * Hurston\/Wright Legacy Award Nominee for Debut Fiction (\/2004 *National Book Award Finalist for Fiction (2003) I knew I had to give it a try. I am glad I have read it, but to say I like it, would just not be true. It’s OK, so I am giving it two stars. There is no real central character to the story, because he dies right off the bat. It is 1855 when Henry Townsend dies. He is black. He had been a slave, but his parents had bought him his freedom. He leaves behind no children but a wife, Caldonia, a twenty-eight-year-old educated black woman born free, and his property of thirty-three slaves and fifty acres in Manchester County, Virginia. The book is about the hell that breaks loose afterwards, but really what it is about is life in the South during the antebellum era, about the mindset of Blacks and Whites of this era. The story is told by an omniscient narrator—who knows how each character thinks, what has happened to all of them in the past and what will happen to all of them in the future. It is this all-seeing narrator that shapes the entire feel of the story. This narrator knows everything, but he is not particularly adept at cogently telling a story. In one sentence you may switch form the present to the future and back again. In the next sentence you flip back to the past. It is easy to become confused. Character upon character is thrown at you, with little tidbits about their lives in the past, present and future. You are given an entire community of individuals—Whites and Blacks, a Native American or two, those who are free and those who are slaves, a sheriff and his deputy. The omniscient narrator is constantly restating who each one is, which is good in one sense, but the flow of the tale becomes jerky. Stop and start, backward and forward and often confusing. Use of the omniscient narrator is pushed to the extreme. It is kind of nice to have a character or two to guide you through a story. You do not have that here. There are a whole group of characters, characters that are hard to attach yourself to. You do not get close to any one individual. In the afterword the author points out that he wanted to draw characters that were neither all good nor all bad, each one different in their own way. You do get that here, but you fail to feel anything for any of them. What you do get is a strong sense of being one of a large community. You are there, one among many, living in the antebellum South. This does give one a hands-on feeling of life then and there and how people were thinking. Kevin Free narrates the audiobook. It is simple to follow, the speed is fine and he intonations are well done. The narration performance is good so I have given the narration three stars."

I don't remember which book I suggested then, but I recall one woman in particular who really loved this book (or I believe she was more in love with Edward Jones' writing). At the end of the workshop we had a gift exchange raffle and she included this book as her contribution. I was the lucky recipient of this free copy. I was interested in this historical novel set in a fictional place in Virginia during the antebellum era, about a former slave who ends up owning slaves. The strangeness of the story and the angle it takes as a slave narrative is intriguing. Also appealing is the way the omniscient narration allows the reader to approach the story without the moral judgement one reserves for this kind of story, since the distance of the narration allows one to realize quickly what the story tries to showcase: how slavery has already poisoned the integrity of all involved. The framework of the novel is composed of anecdotal stories within stories, with pacing often interrupted for a mini scene or two, or an introduction of yet another character who may reappear later or simply disappear. Put another way, it is a book of puzzle pieces: one is added, taken away, another picked up, oh yes, there's the whole, whoops, maybe not, here goes another piece. So although I admired the writing and story setup in the beginning, I just was not in the right space to complete this novel. It has been a while since I added a book to my \"did-not-finish\" list; alas, this one has just made the list. This is not a failed attempt at reading this novel, however, because I remember not being able to finish Ngugi wa Thiong'o's Wizard of the Crow only to later fall in love with his novel, Petals of Blood . With that in mind, I look forward to reading Jones' Lost in the City ."

        "text":"A beautifully paced novel that inverts every cliche about institution of slavery. While not exactly removing race from the issue of slavery, Jones is able to show that even among African-Americans the perniciousness of slavery could damn a generation. The best summary of this idea came from a NYTimes review: 'There are few certified villains in this novel, white or black, because slavery poisons moral judgments at the root. As Jones shows, slavery corrupts good intentions and underwrites bad ones, yet allows decency the odd occasion -- but only by creating such an enormous need for it.' The pacing and structure of this novel could be a little challenging to some, but I found that it fit the narrative perfectly. This isn't a novel that burns you with its quotable sentences, but it scars you with its images. There were periods in it where I thought I was reading a Cormac McCarthy novel. That alone is high praise."

        "text":"When Toni Morrison began her research for \"Beloved,\" she discovered a trove of ghastly instruments. She knew, of course, that slaves were routinely whipped, starved, raped, and hanged, but the existence of specially forged tools was a surprise: metal bits forced down the throat, iron masks locked across the face, spiked collars clasped around the neck. Her Pulitzer Prize-winning novel reintroduced those horrors into the national memory and did much to demonstrate that the cruelties of slavery extended far beyond hard labor and physical deprivation. \"The Known World,\" by Edward Jones, reclaims another peculiarity of American slavery and in the process illustrates yet again that we can't under- estimate its perverse contortions of the human spirit. Bizarre as it sounds, in Louisiana, Virginia, and South Carolina, a small number of free blacks owned their own plantations - and their own slaves. It was a precarious arrangement, to be sure. Blacks who were freed or managed to buy their own freedom had little incentive to tarry in the South. The laws governing their status and their right to hold property were ambiguous and easy for any white person to shred. Jones uses this fragile situation as the setting for a novel about a group of black and white Virginians who tried - sometimes nobly, often viciously - to maintain their world in the face of inevitable collapse. To the extent that Morrison spun a surreal tale of American slavery into mythic proportions, Jones has carved a companion series of stark anecdotes into national legends. In a measured voice that never rises to reflect the agonies and absurdities he describes, he moves back and forth through decades and across state lines, assembling an apparently random collection of brief scenes that gradually fuse into a stunning portrait of moral confusion. The story revolves around Henry Townsend, a black man who, with the indulgence of his former owner, managed to buy his own farm and his own slaves - eventually 29 adults and a collection of children. Henry's parents, who labored tirelessly to free him as a child, are horrified by his participation in the flesh market, but Henry is ambitious, and, what's more, he learned from his master that \"once you own even one, you will never be alone.\" As a protection against loneliness and a way to wealth, Henry can't imagine anything more successful, and he's convinced he can be \"a better master than any white man he had ever known.\" Indeed, he attains that dubious goal, creating a plantation with forced labor that's largely free of physical beatings, but it's an insidious gentility that only camouflages the humiliations of Southern slavery. Nevertheless, his untimely death frightens most of his slaves, who know just how delicate their relative comfort is. Only the brooding overseer, Moses, the first slave Henry ever bought, sees his master's demise as an opportunity - not for freedom, but for taking his place. Indeed, what interests Jones most in this complex novel is the way slavery distorts judgment, not just of those who oppress, but of those who are oppressed. Henry's widow, Caldonia, quickly decides against freeing \"her legacy,\" choosing instead to maintain the plantation in the spirit of Henry's gentle example. \"Her husband had done the best he could,\" she thinks, \"and on Judgment Day his slaves would stand before God and testify to that fact.\" Occasionally, a child is worked to death or a pregnant woman labors in the field till she miscarries, but Caldonia sheds sincere tears, comforts the parents, and considers whether she should buy insurance against further losses of her property. As a single woman with a large business to run, she's encouraged by a collection of family and friends, other free blacks, some of whom own their own slaves, too. One of the most troubling is Fern, Caldonia's prim teacher of literature and etiquette. Together, they keep the irony of their position well buried, while socializing in a kind of racial terrarium maintained by William Robbins, the county's wealthiest white farmer. Estranged from his own wife but protected by his political power, he loves a black woman in town and openly adores his two mulatto children. The Townsend plantation with its little coterie of free slave-owning blacks gives his favorites a place to play and refine themselves. In one of several shifts to the late 19th century, a Canadian historian interviews Fern, Caldonia's teacher, about those days on the plantation. \"All of us do only what the law and God tell us we can do,\" she says without any hint of guilt or remorse. \"We owned slaves. It was what was done, and so that is what we did.\" Jones uses that same tone of historical distance throughout, a tone that amplifies the grotesque mingling of affection and cruelty that infected these people, black and white. In the center of this moral kaleidoscope stands the sheriff, John Skiffington, an earnest Christian, dedicated to the objective application of law and convinced that \"the law always cares\" for everyone equally. It's a doomed endeavor, of course, but as Caldonia's plantation begins to collapse, Skiffington fails to realize that the legal system he's sworn to uphold is not objective and that he cannot remain clean within it. The scrambled collection of events and characters makes this a difficult story to enter, but that structure eventually accounts for much of the novel's evocative power. Jones has a kind of biblical style that suggests whole lives in a few stark details from a perspective that's alternately microscopic and telescopic. It's a technique that resists our efforts to keep these events in some unrecoverable past. The troubling implications of his story leach in through hairline cracks all over the twin shells of antebellum nostalgia and Northern piety. Every time Caldonia cheerfully reminds her friends, \"We are all worthy of one another,\" the legacy of slavery sounds more complex and unresolved. http:\/\/www.csmonitor.com\/2003\/0814\/p1..."

Just another thing that I did not learn in American history. This book had many characters but the characters were not overwhelming. The characters involve a man who worked hard to buy his freedom and eventually the freedom of his wife and later their child only to see their child prosper and purchase slaves for himself. The book also focuses on his slaves and their relationships. There is also the sheriff and his wife who are given a slave girl as a wedding gift even though they are against slavery they raise her and think of her as their \"child\" All of these stories come together in The Known World."

        "text":"Manchester County, Virginia doesn't exist. Never has. After reading The Known World, however, you'd be forgiven if you thought you could take a tour of it's plantations and slave cemetaries on your vacation to colonial Williamsburg. The complicated pre-civil war Southern society that Edward P. Jones creates feels as real and surreal as any factual history of slavery you've read. It was not so much the story of Henry Townsend, a black slave owner, and all the people that his death allows us to meet that engaged me. It was the world, a world where I could taste the soil I might till and the women I might marry and the terrible choices I might be faced with, that put it's claws in me and refused to let go. It took me nearly 2 months to finish the book's 388 pages. It should've been a quick read. It is a fascinating place with peculiar problems and characters I cried for on more than one occasion. It should've been a quick read but I kept asking myself this question: who would I have been? The slave, toiling away in the field? The overseer, unable to see the world for what it truly was? The freed man, working desperately to free the rest of his family? The smart child, taken under the wing of the rich white slave owner and convinced that there was nothing wrong with owning another human being? The broken black man tortured by his family's wealth built on the backs of men and women that look just like me? The slave too proud, too strong, too powerful to let another take his freedom? Who would I have been? Who am I now? In matters of race, there is always that fool's point, usually made by a white person (though not always) that asks,\"why aren't you over it, already? Can't we just let it go?\" It is a way to end an uncomfortable conversation. The reasons don't matter. I know many a person for which the sticky tar baby of race in America is simply a discussion they can't stick their hands in. It is too difficult. Too raw. Too cloudy to be sure that people will remain friends after an honest chat. The way I feel when I read books like The Known World is my answer. No matter how well-adjusted, how integrated, how loving of my fellow man, how multiculti kumbayah I am, I'm not over it. I can't let it go. This fictional world was very real not all that long ago. It's effects still ripple through our every day. The world I know doesn't exist without it. Highly highly recommended."

        "text":"I know this is a critically acclaimed book, a Pulitzer winner, and a book tackling a difficult and complex stain on America history: slavery and black slave owners. There are moments when the book does say some interesting things or reveal some unsavory and uncomfortable truths, but it was so hard to engage with as a reader. I mean, I hung in with DFW through the first 600 pages of Infinite Jest where nothing happens -- but because I was fascinated by Hal, Orin, Marathe, Steeply, and Mario and Madame Psychosis who all fascinated me. There were literally dozens of other characters but these all pulled me in. In The Known World, there are also dozens of characters but none that I grew any attachment too. It was as if the author Jones was using a hand-held camera and no stabilizer so that the images were jumpy and out of focus. It reminded me sometimes of how the world seems to my myopic eyes between taking off my glasses in the morning and putting in my contact lenses. The narration also highly annoyed me. All the parenthetical \"in 60 years so and so will do such as such\" were meaningless because I was given neither enough time nor enough detail to give a shit. Further, there is this reference to \"years later they would all turn into human torches in front of the dry foods store\", but no mention afterwards of to what this referred. But the most annoying bit was in using the Canadian journalist frame at about page 130 or so (which then only briefly appears in the narrative 200 pages later in a parenthetical throwaway comment, it is said that the journalist would never marry his heart's desire yet 3 pages later, they marry and that coming to talk to Fern that there was some incomprehensible stuff that happens off-screen that morning (also never adequately explained) and so she was not going to open up to the journalist and yet we still find her filling in details about Henry, Moses and Caledonia 30 pages later. Too much inconsistency - was the editor asleep or stoned and missed these? So, despite taking on a complex subject, Jones is no Faulkner as his South does not eve approach that of the Great William. He is not as good as Pynchon or DFW is manipulating time and space in a narrative that was 100 or 150 pages too long and felt it, and he is not Alice Walker or Toni Morrison who brought us the most amazing, poignant, and powerful images of slavery and its residual impacts generations later that I have ever read. So, read Beloved or Absalom, Absalom if you want to hear about the South and I expect you will be less frustrated, but every bit enraged at this deplorable institution that is a cancer on the American past."

        "text":"Ambitious, Interesting, Disorganized In an interview, Edward P. Jones revealed that The Known World took shape around 1) when he heard that Black people had owned slaves and 2) when he read a thin paperback in high school about a Jewish man who decided to join the Nazi party, how he acted in opposition to how one would expect. The Known World is an ambitious novel which aims to describe the world of 1855 where Henry Townsend has recently died. As a result of his death, a cloud of uncertainty hangs in the air as he leaves behind his widow, Caldonia, and the undetermined fate of the slaves he purchased to work his land. Although the plot is interesting, this book is disorganized. It covers many different characters and rapidly shifts time periods. I would be reading along and then the text would say “and this person lived to be 93 years old and had 235 grandchildren.” (paraphrasing) Countless times, I had to stop and reread because the storytelling was so clunky. In The Known World, there are quite a few references to Adam and Eve, even references to Milton (Paradise Lost). My favorite author, Philip Pullman, loves to talk about this topic and how in his works he wanted his characters to find their way back to The Garden by taking the long way around. So this quote on page 329 stood out: “There was a long way around but he chose not to take it.” There is a character in The Known World by the name of Anderson Frazier. He creates and distributes pamphlets and interviews Fern Elston. In my opinion, this pamphlet could have provided a framework to systematically organize the characters instead of the resulting jumbled and confusing soup of characters and timelines. The Known World has some unforgettable moments, but the organization of the narrative reduces the enjoyment of the reading experience.

        "text":"This is a complex novel, with dense writing, a non-linear structure, and an abundance of characters. It reads much like a true historical account of a place, Manchester County, Virginia, and time, pre-Civil War 1800s. This could very nearly have passed for a non-fiction book; each character feels so real, their personal stories and histories so authentic. The author even goes so far as to tell us what happens to many of them ten, twenty or even fifty years in the future. And yet, Edward P. Jones himself states: \"The county and town of Manchester, Virginia, and every human being in those places, are products of my imagination… The census records I made up for Manchester were, again, simply to make the reader feel that the town and the county and the people lived and breathed in central Virginia once upon a time…\" Well, consider me duped. At first I really thought such a county existed and the data presented were genuine facts. As my son passed through the living room, I even shouted out some sort of statistic or another and asked if he had ever read about such a thing in his history classes. He couldn’t recall, but it sounded ‘familiar’. Right, because much of this could have been true, yet it wasn’t. The institution of slavery of course was all too real and cruel, and that’s what this book is about, and this is the truth. Slavery in all its forms is evil. Henry Townsend is a black farmer. He is a former slave that with the purchase of freedom and some land becomes a slave owner himself. Henry and his wife Caldonia own a small plantation near the border of his former master’s much larger one. I could not wrap my head around why on earth a freed man would ever want to enslave another human being. Henry and other black slave owners like him justify their actions: \"Henry had always said that he wanted to be a better master than any white man he had ever known. He did not understand that the kind of world he wanted to create was doomed before he had even spoken the first syllable of the word master.\" Well, as the old saying goes, ‘the road to hell is paved with good intentions.’ When Henry dies, all hell breaks loose, and we begin to see the ill-fated consequences of an institution that is immoral and corrupt. A narrative that seems to jump around in time and between characters eventually comes together into a whole as consequences and events snowball out of control. Lives are permanently changed. Some for the worst, others (we hope) for the better. They all become woven together much like the massive tapestry hanging on the wall of another place in another time. Each is part of the story. Everyone is responsible for the events which passed, were allowed to pass despite the huge injustice to humanity. This book is not easy to read. The structure is challenging and the topic is gloomy, albeit important. What happens to the people we grow to care for is often horrifying and heartbreaking. But it is well-written and extremely impactful. An important novel which is well worth your time and attention if you are up for the challenge. It won't suit everyone, but if you are at all interested, I encourage you to pick this one up. \"What I feared most at that moment is what I still fear: that they would remember my history, that I, no matter what I had always said to the contrary, owned people of our Race.\""

Because there is a lot of life and death in this take on pre-Civil War Virginia. I knew little about the book except that the author wrote it after reading about freed Black folks owning slaves. In delving into this issue, which in any modern conversation circle must bring dissonance, disbelief, and maybe even disgust, I became increasingly moved and disturbed. A difficult book, both because it’s an unflinching look at slavery, but also because it’s written in a James Joyce-ish style — lots of asides and stream of consciousness text. The author careens from generation to generation and back again in often the same paragraph. Yet it worked for me. It reads like a memoir of an entire county’s 150-year history complete with dozens of families represented. What results is simply, UNFORGETTABLE. There are characters whose faces I imagined while reading and characters whose stories I became invested in that will haunt me. Not in the truth of a fictional characterization but more because the ugliness of humanity was so blatantly on display and sadly remains real to this day. As I bid farewell to the slaves, slaveowners, children of both and ministers, sheriffs and patrollers of this novel, I will not forget their names. And I can’t help but wonder who would I have been in Manchester County, Virginia? (Reviewed 2\/12\/25)"

        "text":"I'm going to have to rave a bit, because this is one of the best books I've read in the past ten years. Jones packs in all the historical detail you could want, and of course he's hit on a subject--black slaveowners--that in and of itself is tabloid-sensational. Where lesser writers might lean too hard on the sensational aspect (or rely on it to bolster an otherwise weak narrative), Jones works it into a compelling and powerful story. What makes it so powerful is a mix of fascinating characters who are woven into a series of overlapping plotlines. For me it's the structuring that is so brilliant (geek alert: I actually diagrammed the time shifts in the chapters as an exercise, to see when and how Jones yoked the whole thing together). This less than linear approach might be frustrating to those who just want things to be straightforward, but stick with it: the shifts provide suspense as well as texture, and they propel more than one storyline at once. They do all come together, trust me. I also admire the overarching authorial voice in the novel, which certainly leans toward the formal, but also comes across as aware of the history it's grappling with: here and there Jones projects his voice forward for a moment, or seemingly digresses with factual material and research. Again it's all part of the tapestry and the mix, and I also think that the level of narrative awareness (which never disengages long enough to derail anything) adds another layer to the very idea of history--making the whole historical and contemporary both. And for those of you who can do without all of the above writerly blather (a thousand pardons), you'll find in this book characters who are engaging, ignorant, cruel, earnest, sympathetic, tragic, hopeful, flawed--in short, complicated. Halfway through you'll be fighting off the impulse to skip ahead to learn everyone's fate. Finally, I'll say that this book isn't perfect--there are aspects of what I've described above that sometimes don't work: narrative turns that do seem pointless digressions, a character or two a bit stereotypical or annoying. No matter. This book aims high, as brilliant works of art do, and the result is nothing short of amazing."

        "text":"This book demands that you read it slowly and intently. Like eating a huge Thanksgiving dinner, you need to pause and digest before you have the next course. At the outset, the plot seems to be all over the place, bouncing from character to character, telling too many stories, not telling enough and then seeming to tell too much. Ah, but then, you make a little progress and the rhythm begins to assert itself, the stories begin to weave together, the minute details begin to become a diorama, the picture stops being a blur and comes into sharp focus. This isn’t one man’s story, or even the story of one place, this is the story of all men and this is the tale of a world. This book is not so much about race as it is about the abject insanity and evil of the institution of slavery, wherever it is found, whoever is practicing it. In this system, there are free black masters holding black slaves, some of them well-meaning, but it does not make the practice any less immoral. There are white men who love their black mistresses and the children they bear, but it does not remove the fact that they hold a dominion over them that is not borne of love in any of its guises. There are also individuals who are victims of the system and others who refuse to be victims of the system, even at the cost of their lives. I loved many of Jones’ characters, notably Augustus and Mildred Townsend. They exemplify what is the best in us. I felt sorry for some of them, like Sheriff John Skiffington, who would like to be better than this society allows him to be, and Caldonia Townsend’s brother, Calvin, who wishes to go to New York so that he will not have to bear witness to the cruelties around him, cruelties he must realized have escaped him only because of a trick of fortune. I despised some of them, and I recognized most of them. The petty and jealous, who must have dominion over someone to feel they have worth; the ungrateful and traitorous, who would turn upon a friend to put some silver in their own pockets; the meek and hopeless, who bow to the yoke and try simply to find a corner in which they are allowed to exist; the defiant and strong-minded, who fight with their last breath because to do otherwise is to prop up the indefensible; all are here. What I loved most about this novel is its genuineness, its lack of exaggeration or hyperbole, where surely none is needed, its emphasis on the day-to-day injustice of an institution that is accepted as insurmountable or even correct only because it is what is. Edward P. Jones has leveled an attack at the heart of mankind and defied one to imagine what they would have done, what they would have dared to do, in such a place and time."

But they're just the start - the book is really a series of stories & vignettes about the families, friends, neighbors & community surrounding Henry & Caldonia. It took me a really long time to get into the book, because there are so many characters, some important & some not, & the book jumps around in time, making it difficult to follow. Trust me, use the cast of characters at the end of this edition (why not place this at the beginning?!) & give up your expectations about traditional narrative format, & you'll LOVE this book as much as I did. In life, we have our own story kind of playing in our head, & at the same time we have all these other stories we're hearing - the story about your mother's great-uncle. The story about your brother in law's neighbor. The one about your sister's husband's aunt & her neighbor. the one about your coworker's mother. You know all those stories? That's what this book is like - some characters are more important than others, so you hear more of their stories, but minor characters have stories too, & they sort of appear out of nowhere, & you get to hear their story, & then they're gone. It's really very cool! I particularly loved the story of the womanizing slave who has a vision during a lightning storm\/tornado - & becomes the founder of an orphanage. And the little tiny story about the family who don't want to give up their cow, & the woman goes into the barn to milk the cow & there's this lovely description of her squirting the cow's milk into a cat's mouth, & if you've ever seen a cat eat with true contentment you will recognize the cat body language that Jones describes. Toward the end of the book there's a very powerful scene where a character, who isn't a particularly \"good\" character, says there should be a lantern or light of truth in the world, an actual place where people can stand & tell the truth without fear of retribution, where one might be able to right a wrong. It's a moment where you think, yes this guy could right the wrong by speaking out, because his fear of having people think he's \"on the negro's side\" is...well, wrong! But that's his fear & in that moment of the book you understand it & you think, yeah, what if he could speak out under that light of truth & not have anyone judge him? How wonderful would that be? While the book depicts the horrors of slavery, & there are a few characters who are outright despicable, there are many shades of gray in Jones' vision as well. It's a book that will make you think about slavery, the myths & realities & tragedies of it all, & on top of that it'll make you think about your own life & all the people you've known & how complex & interesting we all are, really. It's beautifully written & the characters will stick in your head as if you'd known them too. Oddly, I think what I initially disliked most about this book - its multitude of characters & convoluted timeline - is what I ended up really enjoying! Another example of a book that made my head expand, with some creakiness, but I'm glad the expansion can still happen!"

        "text":"In this book I learned that there used to be black slaveholders in the US. I thought that only white people were allowed to own slaves during the time that owning slaves were like owning properties. During that pre-Abolition time. During those sad dark days in the American history. Black Edward P. Jones (born 1951) wrote this historical epic novel, The Known World based on the not well known fact that there were some black slaveholders (black people owning black slaves) in the state of Virginia during the time in the US when owning slave is legal. Wikipedia has this to say: \"Slavery in the United States was a form of unfree labor which existed as a legal institution in North America for more than a century before the founding of the United States in 1776, and continued mostly in the South until the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution in 1865.[1] The first English colony in North America, Virginia, first imported Africans in 1619, a practice earlier established in the Spanish colonies as early as the 1560s.[2] Most slaves were black and were held by whites, although some Native Americans and free blacks also held slaves; there were a small number of white slaves as well.[3]\" Winner of the 2004 Pulitzer Award for Fiction, The Known World is one of the most memorable reads I had this year. It is not an easy book to read. This 388-page novel left me with a heavy chest each time I closed the book. Each page is gloomy and sad. The novel is well-told with lyrical prose creating a big canvas of imagery in one's mind while reading. In that big canvas are memorable and three-dimensional numerous characters most of them black slaves. No character is downright bad or good. The detailed description of the sceneries of a fictional county called Manchester and the true depictions of the characters are exceptionally striking that I had to slow down in my reading to savor the story and hold on *tugging to them, cheering them on* to each characters. Reading the last page left me with a heavy heart. I would not want to let go of that image of Manchester and say goodbye Please don't go yet to the characters that I already became part of my literary world. The world that resides in the recesses of my brain. The world that is known only to me populated by people who I met only in my readings. In terms of writing, Jones extensively use the technique called prolepsis that I first encountered reading Muriel Sparks' The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie (1961). Jones explained this in the interview (appendix of the book) saying that he is the God of those characters so he knows what happened in the life of each characters from the time he\/she was born up to the time his\/her death. The most moving example of this use was with the character of the child Tessie . One fine day of September 1855, their mistress Caldonia saw the 5-y\/o Tessie playing with a wooden toy horse. Caldonia says to the child: That is very nice, Tessie to which Tessie responded, My papa did this for me . In January 2002, on her deathbed, the old Tessie asked her caretaker to get the wooden toy horse from the attic. While holding the toy, she breathed her last saying the same thing: My papa did this for me . My heart stopped beating. Tears welled up in my eyes. That scene is just one of the many moving scenes about those slaves in that time of the history in Virginia when black people were traded like they were not human but properties. I can make this review very long. There are just too many good things I would like to say here but I am afraid that no review can make justice to a book as good as this."

        "text":"Jar Of Death Pick #28 3.5 Stars Most people probably believe that the only people who owned slaves were white people. But that's actually not the truth. Free blacks owned other black people. Some free blacks bought their family members and others just wanted the slave labor. Native Americans owned slaves for much of the same reasons. The Known World introduces us to some of those people. The Known World has won a whole gang of awards, so we know its an important book and the writing is top notch. My only problems with the book were the fact that there were too many characters. You know this is a pet peeve of mine and I lost track of all the characters in this book. My other problem was that it jumped backwards and forwards in time way too much. Most of the time jumps were super confusing. I liked The Known World but I think I might not be smart enough to read this book. I'll probably reread it sometime in the future and I do recommend to others because its a brilliant book."

However, any plot that might exist was buried so deep beneath the convoluted chronology and extraneous characters and details that I decided I didn't care to keep digging for it, and quit on page 198. The author seemed determined to insert every existing anecdote about slavery into one novel. This might have worked better as a compilation of essays or short stories."

        "text":"The Known World does this weird thing: it cites its sources. And it's weird because they don't exist. There are passages like this: [Manchester, VA] went through a period of years and years of what University of Virginia historian Roberta Murphy in a 1948 book would call 'peace and prosperity'. Jones goes on to tell you the publication history of that book, and a few more things about what was in it, and to imply that Roberta Murphy was a little racist. But there is no Roberta Murphy, there is no book, there is no Manchester, VA. What is Jones up to? Wyatt Mason notes : What research on the subject Jones undertook was, in fact, quickly derailed after he happened upon an account of a white slave owner who spent her days abusing one of her black slaves, a little girl, by beating her head against a wall. “If I had wanted to tell the whole story of slavery, Americans couldn’t have taken that,” Jones told an interviewer. “People want to think that there was slavery, and then we got beyond it. People don’t want to hear that a woman would take a child and bang her head against the wall day after day. It’s nice that I didn’t read all those books. What I would have had to put down is far, far harsher and bleaker. Too much of a bummer? It's not that The Known World is a feel-good novel. Ears and Achilles tendons will be sliced. It follows the rules of slavery books: slave narratives always had happy endings; later, fictional slave narratives always have sad endings. But Toni Morrison has a different opinion about what Americans can and can't take. Shit, so does Harriet Jacobs. And Jones knows this, so he's being disingenuous. And you notice that he's talking about books he didn't actually read. NPR says, Jones collected two shelves of books about slavery, but never got around to reading them. Still, the author was able to use his imagination, and stories he had heard growing up, to make his characters come alive. \"I decided the people I'd created were real enough and I had just accumulated enough information about what the world was like in the South before 1865 to allow me to lie and get away with it,\" he says. Look, I don't mean to say Jones isn't telling the truth. I don't know if he is, and neither does he; neither of us read those two shelves of books about slavery. But the citation of imaginary sources in the book itself serves to either add authenticity that's undeserved, or - if you follow up on those sources - underline its lack of authenticity. I'm puzzled by it. This sort of meta-sourcing has been done before - by Nabokov in Pale Fire, by Cervantes, and in its closest parallel by Borges in his first collection, Universal History of Iniquity, which also confused me. It's especially jarring here, maybe just because I find the truth of slavery a fraught subject, and maybe because the layers go so deep - even in interviews about his lack of authenticity, he appears to be consciously inauthentic. I don't know, man, I don't get it. But anyway: is it a good made-up story about made-up people? Yeah, sure, totally. Eventually. The first half is a little annoying. There's a lot of chronological foofarah - skipping all over the place for no pressing reason - and a ginormous cast it's hard to keep track of, and our super-omniscient narrator often takes time out to tell you some trivial character's entire life story, which you didn't really need. But the second half ratchets up the tension to pure shit-your-pantsville, as that sprawling cast all meet their assorted fates. It makes up for some irritation in the first half. So yeah, as a novel it's excellent. The authenticity issue, I bring up mostly because we take this book seriously; it won a Pulitzer. It deserves to be looked carefully at. I looked carefully and I was confused by its truth."

        "text":"Despite some luminous moments where the characters come alive in a special way, this novel about the lives of slaves in a fictional community in Virginia of the 1830s felt too hermetic and sealed off for me to enjoy it as thoroughly as others might. The special hook that the story holds is its rendering of freed blacks who became slave owners themselves. The focus is on one such plantation with about 30 slaves which is struggling to adapt to the death of its black master, Henry Townsend. We get a plausible history along the way of how his father, Augustus, was so talented at furniture making that he bought his own freedom, and state legislative action allowed him to continue residing in the state and eventually bought the freedom of his son. With other free blacks, such as the feisty, condescending teacher Fern, who came from the North, they form a small society of their own. While Augustus abhors slavery, his son tries to emulate the path taken by the whites to economic success by owning slaves. Despite an ambition to become a benevolent master, the corrupting influence of owning people as property is well portrayed. When his lonely widow takes up a love relationship with her plantation foreman, she is replicating the same abuse of power enacted by most other white plantation owners, and the consequences are tragic. The “known world” of plantation life in this fictional county is like an island in time, and the characters themselves seem stuck in it like insects in amber. The omniscient narrator is god-like in passing into the thoughts and dreams of more than a dozen characters. Unfortunately, the reader gets distanced from emotionally connecting to them by the narrator breaking the flow to leap backward and forward in time to reveal some particular fact or person’s fate (for more see: D.D. Wood review ). Ultimately, the human bonds holding people to each other came off as tenuous and unreal as beholding a ship in a bottle. Unlike the romanticized lives portrayed in Hailey’s “Roots”, the characters have no sense of cultural history of their African origins (the word itself appears nowhere in the book), and there is no foreshadowing of plantation life as a doomed phase in history on the path to the Civil War. The idea of a slave revolt is unthinkable, and the one humane white character, Sheriff Skiffington, feels no compunction over diligently carrying out a big part of his job in organizing night patrols and retrieval efforts when “property” runs away. Though we get no sense of the reality of the “Underground Railroad”, we do get a brilliant vision at one point where Augustus ends up mailing a slave girl to Philadelphia in a crate along with a shipment of his hand-carved walking sticks. In an interview with Jones appended to the audiobook version of the novel, he admits he did not do much research for the book and was not concerned about communicating any particular message to his readers about the history of slavery. As the creator of all the characters, he would not admit to favoring any one character over another. Still the reader can’t help but getting the message of how inhumane slavery was and how individuals trapped in it strived to achieve some form of dignity in their lives. Like other reviewers, I didn’t feel I got to know any of the characters well enough to get emotionally engaged with them. When not interrupted by invasions from the narrator, the prose is effective in evoking the place and time, an obvious factor in helping it gain a Pulitzer Prize. Here is a lovely example from the opening for the book: The evening his master dies he worked again well after he ended the day for the other adults, his own wife among them, and sent them back with hunger and tiredness to their cabins. The young ones, his son among them, had been sent out of the fields an hour or so before the adults, to prepare the late supper and, if there was time enough, to play in a few minutes of sun that were left. When he, Moses, finally freed himself of the ancient and brittle harness that connected him to the oldest mule his master owned, all that was left of the sun was a five-inch long memory of red orange laid out in still waves across the horizon between two mountains on the left and one on the right. He had been in the fields for all of fourteen hours. He paused before leaving the fields as the evening quiet wrapped itself about him. The mule quivered, wanting home and rest. Moses closed his eyes and bent down and took a pinch of the soil and ate it with no more thought than if it were a spot of cornbread. …he ate it not only to discover the strengths and weaknesses of the field, but because eating it tied him to the only thing in his small world that meant almost as much as his own life."

        "text":"Glorious account that gets past cliches. The premise is that two slaves in 1840s Virginia bought their freedom, but their son stayed a little too long under the master's care. What does the family do when the son starts his own farm and buys his own slaves? The mastery of Jones' writing comes in the sense of history that he lends to minute objects, chance encounters, and incantatory reveries within a frought landscape. Not content to write an unwritten history of forgotten people, Jones re-writes the histories that have been written, citing documents the purport to explain the historical phenomenon of free blacks who owned slaves. Passages that carry runaway characters to the north also tie in academic treatises from the next century, deeds and warrants and court decisions that attempted to justify white supremacy, and the momentoes that emancipated children carry to their deathbeds. Jones doesn't neglect to include tales of individual transformation, collective redemption, or international implications in this epic. Characters may come and go like fleeting ghosts, yet the marks they leave may remain. When the words of the plantation master and deeds of the escaped overseer have faded into ineffectual memory, we readers are left with both the sense that an institution has gone horribly wrong and that the people within it can be honorably right; even if the results remain unapparent, the promise of future change remains, along with the threat of complacency and neglect. Jones didn't attempt to detail the national debate over slavery that was current at that time. That limitation on his project was probably a good one. It allows us to see the human effects that rhetoric had covered, and allowed him to devote his attentions to demonstrating the range of positions that people could occupy in relation to the institution. Yes, whether you're descended from a slave, a master, a freed man, a black woman passing as white, an unwilling overseer, a treacherous deputy, a conscientious drunk, or an immigrant Irishwoman sold into prostitution, there's something in this book for you - and I wish that I was only joking, but the irony is that there is no irony here, and sincerity is the least of what we have to do, and memory is only the start of making a history that hasn't stopped."

The novel chronicles his life, the lives of his family members, and the lives of people he encountered in the community. The main characters are three-dimensional and feel like real people, with both admirable traits and flaws. Jones employs an omniscient narrator and non-linear storytelling. He weaves together overlapping stories of past and present events, such that the reader knows what happens to these people in the future before knowing what has happened to them in the book’s “present.” There are a great many characters in this book and the list of Dramatis Personae is helpful in keeping them all straight. This novel is based on a lesser known historical fact. While it was not common, it did happen that some free blacks owned slaves. It lends a complexity to the slavery narrative – showing how people can be impacted by society’s strictures and how victims of exploitation could become perpetrators of the same system. This is not a quick and easy read. It feels like being immersed in the life and times of Manchester County, Virginia, in the 1850s. It is an eloquently written condemnation of oppression in any form. This book won the Pulitzer Prize in 2004."

(i know, i know. this is fiction. a novel. get over it. but it was just kinda weird to me. social commentary inserted into fiction happens. steinbeck did it. teju cole does it. many writers do this. i felt like jones did a crap-ton of research for this book. but then i read this NPR piece . in it, he notes he collected 2 shelves worth of books on slavery... \"but never got around to reading them\" . so this just added to my 'what the?' on the references in the novel and jones' research.) * all of this combined for a really awkward flow, and convoluted storytelling. i felt like it could lose 50-100 pages and be a tighter, better story. in case you think maybe i am a lazy reader - i'm not, i swear! i love nothing more than a meaty, tough read. jones' story is definitely both of these things. he explores the issue of free black people owning slaves in virginia, and he gives us a large cast of active characters. but it all felt so... surface-y. we get the actions and reactions, but we don't really get the motivations or emotions. jones is navigating a morally dodgy landscape, one i would have loved to have gone into more deeply. we are given the horrors and the heartbreaks, but it all felt so detached. and, you know, maybe that is totally on purpose. maybe, for some people, detachment is the only way through such a horrible time in history. jones has collected some serious critical acclaim and recognition over his career. to name a few: he's won the pulitzer, the national book critic's circle award, the PEN\/Hemingway award, a MacArthur genius grant, and the International IMPAC dublin literary award. he's won nearly $1 million in literary awards alone. the man knows what he's doing, and the respect he's earned is fairly universal. the known world is an important story. but is just shining the light on the issues jones raises enough? so now i am back to the should . i should love this book. (it was just okay for me.) people should read this book. (indeed. but this is not a book i will blanket recommend to all.) so, i don't know you guys. i am bummed over this one. and this is a terrible review\/collection of thoughts. maybe i'll become more coherent with some distance and fix this up a bit - but for now i wanted to note down something here. (aside #1 (going to be a bit spoiler-y here): moses confused me. or, rather, his turn to all-of-a-sudden being an asshole was weird. we're going along with moses. he seems like a lovely man. then, halfway into the book, he's a wife-beater, jerkface? where did that come from, and why was he presented like that? the reveal of moses being a not nice man was sudden and odd.) (aside #2: worth noting (was hugely interesting to me) - the cover photo of this edition is © Eudora Welty ! i had no idea about her photographic prowess .)"

On top of that, the book has won all sorts of prizes: *Pulitzer Prize for Fiction (2004) *International Dublin Literary Award (2005) *Anisfield-Wolf Book Award (2004) *National Book Critics Circle Award for Fiction (2003) * Hurston\/Wright Legacy Award Nominee for Debut Fiction (\/2004 *National Book Award Finalist for Fiction (2003) I knew I had to give it a try. I am glad I have read it, but to say I like it, would just not be true. It’s OK, so I am giving it two stars. There is no real central character to the story, because he dies right off the bat. It is 1855 when Henry Townsend dies. He is black. He had been a slave, but his parents had bought him his freedom. He leaves behind no children but a wife, Caldonia, a twenty-eight-year-old educated black woman born free, and his property of thirty-three slaves and fifty acres in Manchester County, Virginia. The book is about the hell that breaks loose afterwards, but really what it is about is life in the South during the antebellum era, about the mindset of Blacks and Whites of this era. The story is told by an omniscient narrator—who knows how each character thinks, what has happened to all of them in the past and what will happen to all of them in the future. It is this all-seeing narrator that shapes the entire feel of the story. This narrator knows everything, but he is not particularly adept at cogently telling a story. In one sentence you may switch form the present to the future and back again. In the next sentence you flip back to the past. It is easy to become confused. Character upon character is thrown at you, with little tidbits about their lives in the past, present and future. You are given an entire community of individuals—Whites and Blacks, a Native American or two, those who are free and those who are slaves, a sheriff and his deputy. The omniscient narrator is constantly restating who each one is, which is good in one sense, but the flow of the tale becomes jerky. Stop and start, backward and forward and often confusing. Use of the omniscient narrator is pushed to the extreme. It is kind of nice to have a character or two to guide you through a story. You do not have that here. There are a whole group of characters, characters that are hard to attach yourself to. You do not get close to any one individual. In the afterword the author points out that he wanted to draw characters that were neither all good nor all bad, each one different in their own way. You do get that here, but you fail to feel anything for any of them. What you do get is a strong sense of being one of a large community. You are there, one among many, living in the antebellum South. This does give one a hands-on feeling of life then and there and how people were thinking. Kevin Free narrates the audiobook. It is simple to follow, the speed is fine and he intonations are well done. The narration performance is good so I have given the narration three stars."

I don't remember which book I suggested then, but I recall one woman in particular who really loved this book (or I believe she was more in love with Edward Jones' writing). At the end of the workshop we had a gift exchange raffle and she included this book as her contribution. I was the lucky recipient of this free copy. I was interested in this historical novel set in a fictional place in Virginia during the antebellum era, about a former slave who ends up owning slaves. The strangeness of the story and the angle it takes as a slave narrative is intriguing. Also appealing is the way the omniscient narration allows the reader to approach the story without the moral judgement one reserves for this kind of story, since the distance of the narration allows one to realize quickly what the story tries to showcase: how slavery has already poisoned the integrity of all involved. The framework of the novel is composed of anecdotal stories within stories, with pacing often interrupted for a mini scene or two, or an introduction of yet another character who may reappear later or simply disappear. Put another way, it is a book of puzzle pieces: one is added, taken away, another picked up, oh yes, there's the whole, whoops, maybe not, here goes another piece. So although I admired the writing and story setup in the beginning, I just was not in the right space to complete this novel. It has been a while since I added a book to my \"did-not-finish\" list; alas, this one has just made the list. This is not a failed attempt at reading this novel, however, because I remember not being able to finish Ngugi wa Thiong'o's Wizard of the Crow only to later fall in love with his novel, Petals of Blood . With that in mind, I look forward to reading Jones' Lost in the City ."

        "text":"A beautifully paced novel that inverts every cliche about institution of slavery. While not exactly removing race from the issue of slavery, Jones is able to show that even among African-Americans the perniciousness of slavery could damn a generation. The best summary of this idea came from a NYTimes review: 'There are few certified villains in this novel, white or black, because slavery poisons moral judgments at the root. As Jones shows, slavery corrupts good intentions and underwrites bad ones, yet allows decency the odd occasion -- but only by creating such an enormous need for it.' The pacing and structure of this novel could be a little challenging to some, but I found that it fit the narrative perfectly. This isn't a novel that burns you with its quotable sentences, but it scars you with its images. There were periods in it where I thought I was reading a Cormac McCarthy novel. That alone is high praise."

        "text":"When Toni Morrison began her research for \"Beloved,\" she discovered a trove of ghastly instruments. She knew, of course, that slaves were routinely whipped, starved, raped, and hanged, but the existence of specially forged tools was a surprise: metal bits forced down the throat, iron masks locked across the face, spiked collars clasped around the neck. Her Pulitzer Prize-winning novel reintroduced those horrors into the national memory and did much to demonstrate that the cruelties of slavery extended far beyond hard labor and physical deprivation. \"The Known World,\" by Edward Jones, reclaims another peculiarity of American slavery and in the process illustrates yet again that we can't under- estimate its perverse contortions of the human spirit. Bizarre as it sounds, in Louisiana, Virginia, and South Carolina, a small number of free blacks owned their own plantations - and their own slaves. It was a precarious arrangement, to be sure. Blacks who were freed or managed to buy their own freedom had little incentive to tarry in the South. The laws governing their status and their right to hold property were ambiguous and easy for any white person to shred. Jones uses this fragile situation as the setting for a novel about a group of black and white Virginians who tried - sometimes nobly, often viciously - to maintain their world in the face of inevitable collapse. To the extent that Morrison spun a surreal tale of American slavery into mythic proportions, Jones has carved a companion series of stark anecdotes into national legends. In a measured voice that never rises to reflect the agonies and absurdities he describes, he moves back and forth through decades and across state lines, assembling an apparently random collection of brief scenes that gradually fuse into a stunning portrait of moral confusion. The story revolves around Henry Townsend, a black man who, with the indulgence of his former owner, managed to buy his own farm and his own slaves - eventually 29 adults and a collection of children. Henry's parents, who labored tirelessly to free him as a child, are horrified by his participation in the flesh market, but Henry is ambitious, and, what's more, he learned from his master that \"once you own even one, you will never be alone.\" As a protection against loneliness and a way to wealth, Henry can't imagine anything more successful, and he's convinced he can be \"a better master than any white man he had ever known.\" Indeed, he attains that dubious goal, creating a plantation with forced labor that's largely free of physical beatings, but it's an insidious gentility that only camouflages the humiliations of Southern slavery. Nevertheless, his untimely death frightens most of his slaves, who know just how delicate their relative comfort is. Only the brooding overseer, Moses, the first slave Henry ever bought, sees his master's demise as an opportunity - not for freedom, but for taking his place. Indeed, what interests Jones most in this complex novel is the way slavery distorts judgment, not just of those who oppress, but of those who are oppressed. Henry's widow, Caldonia, quickly decides against freeing \"her legacy,\" choosing instead to maintain the plantation in the spirit of Henry's gentle example. \"Her husband had done the best he could,\" she thinks, \"and on Judgment Day his slaves would stand before God and testify to that fact.\" Occasionally, a child is worked to death or a pregnant woman labors in the field till she miscarries, but Caldonia sheds sincere tears, comforts the parents, and considers whether she should buy insurance against further losses of her property. As a single woman with a large business to run, she's encouraged by a collection of family and friends, other free blacks, some of whom own their own slaves, too. One of the most troubling is Fern, Caldonia's prim teacher of literature and etiquette. Together, they keep the irony of their position well buried, while socializing in a kind of racial terrarium maintained by William Robbins, the county's wealthiest white farmer. Estranged from his own wife but protected by his political power, he loves a black woman in town and openly adores his two mulatto children. The Townsend plantation with its little coterie of free slave-owning blacks gives his favorites a place to play and refine themselves. In one of several shifts to the late 19th century, a Canadian historian interviews Fern, Caldonia's teacher, about those days on the plantation. \"All of us do only what the law and God tell us we can do,\" she says without any hint of guilt or remorse. \"We owned slaves. It was what was done, and so that is what we did.\" Jones uses that same tone of historical distance throughout, a tone that amplifies the grotesque mingling of affection and cruelty that infected these people, black and white. In the center of this moral kaleidoscope stands the sheriff, John Skiffington, an earnest Christian, dedicated to the objective application of law and convinced that \"the law always cares\" for everyone equally. It's a doomed endeavor, of course, but as Caldonia's plantation begins to collapse, Skiffington fails to realize that the legal system he's sworn to uphold is not objective and that he cannot remain clean within it. The scrambled collection of events and characters makes this a difficult story to enter, but that structure eventually accounts for much of the novel's evocative power. Jones has a kind of biblical style that suggests whole lives in a few stark details from a perspective that's alternately microscopic and telescopic. It's a technique that resists our efforts to keep these events in some unrecoverable past. The troubling implications of his story leach in through hairline cracks all over the twin shells of antebellum nostalgia and Northern piety. Every time Caldonia cheerfully reminds her friends, \"We are all worthy of one another,\" the legacy of slavery sounds more complex and unresolved. http:\/\/www.csmonitor.com\/2003\/0814\/p1..."

        "text":"Most readers have a favorite author, and mine is probably John McPhee. A writer of non-fiction, he takes delight in exploring unconventional aspects of our society, presented through colorful individuals and described in crisp and scintillating language. This book is a sampler , containing excerpts from a dozen books, an admirable introduction for anyone new to McPhee's style. Collections like this are often disjointed and fragmentary, but not here: each section stands on its own, each is a minor masterpiece, each tells a story, and the editor's introductory analysis of McPhee's style is masterful in its own way. First published in 1976, it is still in print, like other books by McPhee. He wrote many more after that--about Alaska, about the geology of the western US (three books, a bit heavy with geology jargon), about an ocean trip with the US merchant marine, also stories about bears in New Jersey, about attempts to contain the mighty Mississippi and lava flows on Iceland, and so forth, up to his recent \"Ransom of Russian Art,\" his twenty-third. As the above list shows, McPhee's interests are rather wide-ranging. The books excerpted here touch on canoeing in Maine, on travels through the sparsely populated (yes!) center of New Jersey, and on dreamers or visionaries (pick your choice) who plan trips to the stars by controlled atomic explosions, and others who fly a craft that is a hybrid between an airplane and an airship. All these sparkle with apt metaphors (\"Generally speaking, if I had a choice between hiking and peeling potatoes, I would peel the potatoes\"). And the descriptions are intimate and personal: all are based on first-hand experiences by McPhee, as he follows his subjects wherever they take him. I ought to admit here that his point of view is somewhat masculine, but there is more than enough in his writings to attract any reader. He also has the gift of digging up unusual stories--e.g. in \" Oranges \" he tells practically all you might want about Florida's sunshine product. You not only learn the ins and outs of \"Indian River oranges\" (it's a lagoon, not a river), but also how Ossian B. Hart, later governor of the state, played his violin to an audience of alligators. And he uncovers interesting characters, sometimes precociously so. McPhee's first book was an admiring portrayal of a talented basketball player he got to know during college years: Bill Bradley later became US senator from New Jersey and a serious contender for the US presidential nomination. Four years later he wrote an equally admiring book about a nearly unknown young Black tennis player from Richmond, Virginia, Arthur Ashe. And in \" Travels in Georgia \", a wilderness adventure, he describes his meeting with \"Governor Jimmy Carter\". All these are included here, as is an encounter between David Brouwer, head of the Sierra Club, and an opponent of Brouwer, a prominent pro-development westerner. Both were invited by McPhee to share a rafting trip down the Grand Canyon. And much, much more. In each generation, only a handful of books endure and become part of the literary heritage handed down from generation to generation. It is too early to tell, but McPhee's writings may well end up in this class. A century hence, if anyone would like to understand the peculiar creativity that made twentieth century America the great country it is, he might well find the clearest answer in McPhee's true-to-life explorations."

And, as this collection shows, that's a damn shame. The first John McPhee reader is a well-edited collection showcasing selections from his first dozen books and cover everything from the cultivation and selling of fruit (Oranges), an in-depth profile of two tennis stars (Levels of the Game), the quirky scientists who design and built atomic bombs (The Curve of Binding Energy), the head of the Metropolitan Museum of Art (A Roomful of Hovings) and more. Taken as a whole, it's nothing short of stunning that McPhee is able to cover to much ground and do it all so well; he feels equally at home going into scientific workings of nuclear propulsion as he does writing about basketball. Of course, as anybody who's read McPhee before knows, the core of this book is based around two kinds of writing: writing about people and writing about nature. And in the book's strongest sections, McPhee does both. The excerpt from Encounters with the Archdruid is so detailed, you feel not only like you're riding in a canoe down the Colorado River, but that you know both Floyd Dominy and David Brower, are party to their fighting and know it's because they're both equally passionate about their work. But that's only one section. His trip in a birchbark canoe is just as good, as a working vacation to a Scottish island. It's all good, and like the best anthologies, it made me want to pick up each individual volume. Highly recommended."

It is interesting to see his development as a writer from the first piece, a biographical one about the basketball star and future senator, Bill Bradley, to the last piece, one about a canoe trip in a birch bark canoe. He could write about any subject and make it interesting. He is also supposed to be one of Jimmy Carter's favorite writers. And Jimmy Carter appears briefly in one of the pieces. The piece about floating the Grand Canyon and the issues around the dams on the Colorado River, Encounters with the Arch Druid, is fascinating give the current conditions along that river. His first book was published in 1965, his most recent was in 2018. Can't think of many authors with that long of a creative life, and it's possible he may have another one in him as he's still putting occasional pieces in The New Yorker. This is a very good introduction to McPhee's writing."

Basketball, tennis, oranges, hydrogen bombs, bark canoes, dams, wingless flying vehicle, medieval relics and the people playing, growing, inventing, flying, building, studying and opposing them are his subject matter. He writes with depth, flair and humor. And the reader comes away with amazing understanding of his subjects. This is a collection of excerpts from McPhee's first 12 books, edited and introduced by William Howarth. The collection was published in 1976. Bill Bradley went on to be US Senator and I suspect the orange industry in Florida has changed. So far we haven't tried space flight powered by hydrogen bombs. The story of McPhee visiting the World Trade Center in the early 70's with a physicist, who explains how the building could be brought down by a small, easily-assembled nuclear bomb was horrifyingly eerie. I had to trudge through some of these and others were amazing."

        "text":"This book contains 12 articles, or chapters, that were written by McPhee from 1965 to 1975. The strongest single element in these works is McPhee’s use of detail. In The Pine Barrens McPhee tells the story about New Jersey’s great forest, the Pine Barrens, and its back-woods inhabitants, the “pineys.” The piece is richly appointed with details about the history of the Pine Barrens, the people who live there, and the forest itself. Consider the following description of a piney named Bill Wasovwich: “In a straight-backed chair near the doorway to the kitchen sat a young man with long black hair, who wore a visored red leather cap that was darkened with age. His shirt was course-woven and had eyelets down a V neck that was laced with a thong. His trousers were made of canvas, and he was wearing gum boots.” McPhee lets us actually see this character by painting him in such vivid details. He gives us colors, hues, and textures that make his words spring to life, and leaves firm images in a readers mind. McPhee extends the use of details to the historical narratives he utilizes in his works. Here is an example from The Pine Barrens. “The wizard” of the pines was Jerry Munyhon. He could make a cat’s paw come through a key hole. He could cause axes to chop wood by themselves. He could cause money to multiply. He was bulletproof. And he once caught a bullet that was fired at him and handed it back to the man who had done the shooting.” Page 77, paragraph 2. McPhee had to talk to many piney to get all these wonderful details about the Munyhon, and he gives us a marvelous look into the folklore of the pineys as a result. But McPhee is also keen on using details to describe things as well as people and history. In A Roomful of Hovings McPhee profiles the life and times of the New York Metropolitan Museum’s director, Thomas Hoving. He describes an important ivory artifact that Hoving procured for the museum called the Cross of Bury St. Edmunds in the following passage. “Carved in walrus ivory, the two foot cross had sixty-three cryptically abbreviated inscriptions in Greek and Latin and a hundred and eight carved figures, which were sharply detailed and extraordinarily alive in their gestures and expressions….” Page 110, paragraph 1. This began a long and detailed description of the artifact and its history that went on for four pages. I was enthralled by both the descriptive and historical details that McPhee used, and am convinced that he becomes an expert on anything he writes about."

Dense with facts and figures, the narrative is so compelling that you'll forget it's not fiction, you'll take an interest in topics to which you'd previously never given a thought, and you'll wish you could meet the people that McPhee is describing. This book offers a sampler of McPhee's work, taking excerpts from a dozen books. My favorite involves a rafting trip down the Colorado River to which he invited a radical conservationist and the head of the US Water Reclamation District, who would put dams every 20 miles of the river's length if he could. What a ride! I also really liked his tribute to the Headmaster of Deerfield Academy. The book's biggest shortcoming is that it is going to make my \"to-read\" list even longer, because now I am compelled to read the full version of several of these pieces."

        "text":"Most readers have a favorite author, and mine is probably John McPhee. A writer of non-fiction, he takes delight in exploring unconventional aspects of our society, presented through colorful individuals and described in crisp and scintillating language. This book is a sampler , containing excerpts from a dozen books, an admirable introduction for anyone new to McPhee's style. Collections like this are often disjointed and fragmentary, but not here: each section stands on its own, each is a minor masterpiece, each tells a story, and the editor's introductory analysis of McPhee's style is masterful in its own way. First published in 1976, it is still in print, like other books by McPhee. He wrote many more after that--about Alaska, about the geology of the western US (three books, a bit heavy with geology jargon), about an ocean trip with the US merchant marine, also stories about bears in New Jersey, about attempts to contain the mighty Mississippi and lava flows on Iceland, and so forth, up to his recent \"Ransom of Russian Art,\" his twenty-third. As the above list shows, McPhee's interests are rather wide-ranging. The books excerpted here touch on canoeing in Maine, on travels through the sparsely populated (yes!) center of New Jersey, and on dreamers or visionaries (pick your choice) who plan trips to the stars by controlled atomic explosions, and others who fly a craft that is a hybrid between an airplane and an airship. All these sparkle with apt metaphors (\"Generally speaking, if I had a choice between hiking and peeling potatoes, I would peel the potatoes\"). And the descriptions are intimate and personal: all are based on first-hand experiences by McPhee, as he follows his subjects wherever they take him. I ought to admit here that his point of view is somewhat masculine, but there is more than enough in his writings to attract any reader. He also has the gift of digging up unusual stories--e.g. in \" Oranges \" he tells practically all you might want about Florida's sunshine product. You not only learn the ins and outs of \"Indian River oranges\" (it's a lagoon, not a river), but also how Ossian B. Hart, later governor of the state, played his violin to an audience of alligators. And he uncovers interesting characters, sometimes precociously so. McPhee's first book was an admiring portrayal of a talented basketball player he got to know during college years: Bill Bradley later became US senator from New Jersey and a serious contender for the US presidential nomination. Four years later he wrote an equally admiring book about a nearly unknown young Black tennis player from Richmond, Virginia, Arthur Ashe. And in \" Travels in Georgia \", a wilderness adventure, he describes his meeting with \"Governor Jimmy Carter\". All these are included here, as is an encounter between David Brouwer, head of the Sierra Club, and an opponent of Brouwer, a prominent pro-development westerner. Both were invited by McPhee to share a rafting trip down the Grand Canyon. And much, much more. In each generation, only a handful of books endure and become part of the literary heritage handed down from generation to generation. It is too early to tell, but McPhee's writings may well end up in this class. A century hence, if anyone would like to understand the peculiar creativity that made twentieth century America the great country it is, he might well find the clearest answer in McPhee's true-to-life explorations."

And, as this collection shows, that's a damn shame. The first John McPhee reader is a well-edited collection showcasing selections from his first dozen books and cover everything from the cultivation and selling of fruit (Oranges), an in-depth profile of two tennis stars (Levels of the Game), the quirky scientists who design and built atomic bombs (The Curve of Binding Energy), the head of the Metropolitan Museum of Art (A Roomful of Hovings) and more. Taken as a whole, it's nothing short of stunning that McPhee is able to cover to much ground and do it all so well; he feels equally at home going into scientific workings of nuclear propulsion as he does writing about basketball. Of course, as anybody who's read McPhee before knows, the core of this book is based around two kinds of writing: writing about people and writing about nature. And in the book's strongest sections, McPhee does both. The excerpt from Encounters with the Archdruid is so detailed, you feel not only like you're riding in a canoe down the Colorado River, but that you know both Floyd Dominy and David Brower, are party to their fighting and know it's because they're both equally passionate about their work. But that's only one section. His trip in a birchbark canoe is just as good, as a working vacation to a Scottish island. It's all good, and like the best anthologies, it made me want to pick up each individual volume. Highly recommended."

        "text":"This book contains 12 articles, or chapters, that were written by McPhee from 1965 to 1975. The strongest single element in these works is McPhee’s use of detail. In The Pine Barrens McPhee tells the story about New Jersey’s great forest, the Pine Barrens, and its back-woods inhabitants, the “pineys.” The piece is richly appointed with details about the history of the Pine Barrens, the people who live there, and the forest itself. Consider the following description of a piney named Bill Wasovwich: “In a straight-backed chair near the doorway to the kitchen sat a young man with long black hair, who wore a visored red leather cap that was darkened with age. His shirt was course-woven and had eyelets down a V neck that was laced with a thong. His trousers were made of canvas, and he was wearing gum boots.” McPhee lets us actually see this character by painting him in such vivid details. He gives us colors, hues, and textures that make his words spring to life, and leaves firm images in a readers mind. McPhee extends the use of details to the historical narratives he utilizes in his works. Here is an example from The Pine Barrens. “The wizard” of the pines was Jerry Munyhon. He could make a cat’s paw come through a key hole. He could cause axes to chop wood by themselves. He could cause money to multiply. He was bulletproof. And he once caught a bullet that was fired at him and handed it back to the man who had done the shooting.” Page 77, paragraph 2. McPhee had to talk to many piney to get all these wonderful details about the Munyhon, and he gives us a marvelous look into the folklore of the pineys as a result. But McPhee is also keen on using details to describe things as well as people and history. In A Roomful of Hovings McPhee profiles the life and times of the New York Metropolitan Museum’s director, Thomas Hoving. He describes an important ivory artifact that Hoving procured for the museum called the Cross of Bury St. Edmunds in the following passage. “Carved in walrus ivory, the two foot cross had sixty-three cryptically abbreviated inscriptions in Greek and Latin and a hundred and eight carved figures, which were sharply detailed and extraordinarily alive in their gestures and expressions….” Page 110, paragraph 1. This began a long and detailed description of the artifact and its history that went on for four pages. I was enthralled by both the descriptive and historical details that McPhee used, and am convinced that he becomes an expert on anything he writes about."

Dense with facts and figures, the narrative is so compelling that you'll forget it's not fiction, you'll take an interest in topics to which you'd previously never given a thought, and you'll wish you could meet the people that McPhee is describing. This book offers a sampler of McPhee's work, taking excerpts from a dozen books. My favorite involves a rafting trip down the Colorado River to which he invited a radical conservationist and the head of the US Water Reclamation District, who would put dams every 20 miles of the river's length if he could. What a ride! I also really liked his tribute to the Headmaster of Deerfield Academy. The book's biggest shortcoming is that it is going to make my \"to-read\" list even longer, because now I am compelled to read the full version of several of these pieces."

The man was my gold standard when I wrote Deaf Side Story and remains an idol today. But it's not just the prose, it's his topics. One could say he is (often) an \"environmental\" writer, but that's too simple, and misses the mark: what McPhee does so well is to pick the exact focal point within a larger field, be it art of geology, and zero in on what's important. Not just a \"reader,\" this is a primer on solid, valuable non-fiction."

        "text":"Most readers have a favorite author, and mine is probably John McPhee. A writer of non-fiction, he takes delight in exploring unconventional aspects of our society, presented through colorful individuals and described in crisp and scintillating language. This book is a sampler , containing excerpts from a dozen books, an admirable introduction for anyone new to McPhee's style. Collections like this are often disjointed and fragmentary, but not here: each section stands on its own, each is a minor masterpiece, each tells a story, and the editor's introductory analysis of McPhee's style is masterful in its own way. First published in 1976, it is still in print, like other books by McPhee. He wrote many more after that--about Alaska, about the geology of the western US (three books, a bit heavy with geology jargon), about an ocean trip with the US merchant marine, also stories about bears in New Jersey, about attempts to contain the mighty Mississippi and lava flows on Iceland, and so forth, up to his recent \"Ransom of Russian Art,\" his twenty-third. As the above list shows, McPhee's interests are rather wide-ranging. The books excerpted here touch on canoeing in Maine, on travels through the sparsely populated (yes!) center of New Jersey, and on dreamers or visionaries (pick your choice) who plan trips to the stars by controlled atomic explosions, and others who fly a craft that is a hybrid between an airplane and an airship. All these sparkle with apt metaphors (\"Generally speaking, if I had a choice between hiking and peeling potatoes, I would peel the potatoes\"). And the descriptions are intimate and personal: all are based on first-hand experiences by McPhee, as he follows his subjects wherever they take him. I ought to admit here that his point of view is somewhat masculine, but there is more than enough in his writings to attract any reader. He also has the gift of digging up unusual stories--e.g. in \" Oranges \" he tells practically all you might want about Florida's sunshine product. You not only learn the ins and outs of \"Indian River oranges\" (it's a lagoon, not a river), but also how Ossian B. Hart, later governor of the state, played his violin to an audience of alligators. And he uncovers interesting characters, sometimes precociously so. McPhee's first book was an admiring portrayal of a talented basketball player he got to know during college years: Bill Bradley later became US senator from New Jersey and a serious contender for the US presidential nomination. Four years later he wrote an equally admiring book about a nearly unknown young Black tennis player from Richmond, Virginia, Arthur Ashe. And in \" Travels in Georgia \", a wilderness adventure, he describes his meeting with \"Governor Jimmy Carter\". All these are included here, as is an encounter between David Brouwer, head of the Sierra Club, and an opponent of Brouwer, a prominent pro-development westerner. Both were invited by McPhee to share a rafting trip down the Grand Canyon. And much, much more. In each generation, only a handful of books endure and become part of the literary heritage handed down from generation to generation. It is too early to tell, but McPhee's writings may well end up in this class. A century hence, if anyone would like to understand the peculiar creativity that made twentieth century America the great country it is, he might well find the clearest answer in McPhee's true-to-life explorations."

And, as this collection shows, that's a damn shame. The first John McPhee reader is a well-edited collection showcasing selections from his first dozen books and cover everything from the cultivation and selling of fruit (Oranges), an in-depth profile of two tennis stars (Levels of the Game), the quirky scientists who design and built atomic bombs (The Curve of Binding Energy), the head of the Metropolitan Museum of Art (A Roomful of Hovings) and more. Taken as a whole, it's nothing short of stunning that McPhee is able to cover to much ground and do it all so well; he feels equally at home going into scientific workings of nuclear propulsion as he does writing about basketball. Of course, as anybody who's read McPhee before knows, the core of this book is based around two kinds of writing: writing about people and writing about nature. And in the book's strongest sections, McPhee does both. The excerpt from Encounters with the Archdruid is so detailed, you feel not only like you're riding in a canoe down the Colorado River, but that you know both Floyd Dominy and David Brower, are party to their fighting and know it's because they're both equally passionate about their work. But that's only one section. His trip in a birchbark canoe is just as good, as a working vacation to a Scottish island. It's all good, and like the best anthologies, it made me want to pick up each individual volume. Highly recommended."

It is interesting to see his development as a writer from the first piece, a biographical one about the basketball star and future senator, Bill Bradley, to the last piece, one about a canoe trip in a birch bark canoe. He could write about any subject and make it interesting. He is also supposed to be one of Jimmy Carter's favorite writers. And Jimmy Carter appears briefly in one of the pieces. The piece about floating the Grand Canyon and the issues around the dams on the Colorado River, Encounters with the Arch Druid, is fascinating give the current conditions along that river. His first book was published in 1965, his most recent was in 2018. Can't think of many authors with that long of a creative life, and it's possible he may have another one in him as he's still putting occasional pieces in The New Yorker.

Bill Bradley went on to be US Senator and I suspect the orange industry in Florida has changed. So far we haven't tried space flight powered by hydrogen bombs. The story of McPhee visiting the World Trade Center in the early 70's with a physicist, who explains how the building could be brought down by a small, easily-assembled nuclear bomb was horrifyingly eerie.

In The Pine Barrens McPhee tells the story about New Jersey’s great forest, the Pine Barrens, and its back-woods inhabitants, the “pineys.” The piece is richly appointed with details about the history of the Pine Barrens, the people who live there, and the forest itself. Consider the following description of a piney named Bill Wasovwich: “In a straight-backed chair near the doorway to the kitchen sat a young man with long black hair, who wore a visored red leather cap that was darkened with age. His shirt was course-woven and had eyelets down a V neck that was laced with a thong. His trousers were made of canvas, and he was wearing gum boots.” McPhee lets us actually see this character by painting him in such vivid details. He gives us colors, hues, and textures that make his words spring to life, and leaves firm images in a readers mind. McPhee extends the use of details to the historical narratives he utilizes in his works. Here is an example from The Pine Barrens. “The wizard” of the pines was Jerry Munyhon. He could make a cat’s paw come through a key hole. He could cause axes to chop wood by themselves. He could cause money to multiply. He was bulletproof. And he once caught a bullet that was fired at him and handed it back to the man who had done the shooting.” Page 77, paragraph 2. McPhee had to talk to many piney to get all these wonderful details about the Munyhon, and he gives us a marvelous look into the folklore of the pineys as a result. But McPhee is also keen on using details to describe things as well as people and history. In A Roomful of Hovings McPhee profiles the life and times of the New York Metropolitan Museum’s director, Thomas Hoving. He describes an important ivory artifact that Hoving procured for the museum called the Cross of Bury St. Edmunds in the following passage. “Carved in walrus ivory, the two foot cross had sixty-three cryptically abbreviated inscriptions in Greek and Latin and a hundred and eight carved figures, which were sharply detailed and extraordinarily alive in their gestures and expressions….” Page 110, paragraph 1. This began a long and detailed description of the artifact and its history that went on for four pages. I was enthralled by both the descriptive and historical details that McPhee used, and am convinced that he becomes an expert on anything he writes about."

Dense with facts and figures, the narrative is so compelling that you'll forget it's not fiction, you'll take an interest in topics to which you'd previously never given a thought, and you'll wish you could meet the people that McPhee is describing. This book offers a sampler of McPhee's work, taking excerpts from a dozen books. My favorite involves a rafting trip down the Colorado River to which he invited a radical conservationist and the head of the US Water Reclamation District, who would put dams every 20 miles of the river's length if he could. What a ride! I also really liked his tribute to the Headmaster of Deerfield Academy. The book's biggest shortcoming is that it is going to make my \"to-read\" list even longer, because now I am compelled to read the full version of several of these pieces."

McPhee is a consummate journalist, one of the best I've ever encountered at simply packing each line, paragraph, and piece with valid, juicy information. The man was my gold standard when I wrote Deaf Side Story and remains an idol today. But it's not just the prose, it's his topics. One could say he is (often) an \"environmental\" writer, but that's too simple, and misses the mark: what McPhee does so well is to pick the exact focal point within a larger field, be it art of geology, and zero in on what's important. Not just a \"reader,\" this is a primer on solid, valuable non-fiction."

They are people who have addressed themselves to a need for a unifying generalism in a world that has become greatly subdivided by specialization, physicians who work with the \"unquantifiable idea that a doctor who treats your grandmother, your father, your niece, and your daughter will be more adroit in treating you.\" These young men and women are seen in their examining rooms in various rural communities in Maine, but Maine is only the example. Their medical objectives, their successes, the professional obstacles they do and do not overcome are representative of any place family practitioners are working. While essential medical background is provided, McPhee's masterful approach to a trend significant to all of us is replete with affecting, and often amusing, stories about both doctors and their charges.",

They keep the room airy, dustless, and clean. They feed the patient with an eye-dropper. Month in, year out, they give her loving, intensive care.

        "text":"I come from a family of general practitioners - my mother was a G.P. and my sister followed in her footsteps - and I am a fan of John McPhee's writing, in general. So I expected to like this book more than I actually did. The book follows the standard McPhee schema - in-depth reporting on a very specific topic, in this case doctors who choose to work as general practitioners. McPhee provides vignettes of a dozen or so such doctors, almost all of them working in Maine. McPhee is usually very effective in working from the specific to reach more general insights, and it is clear that he would like to do the same here. That is, by focusing on doctors who have opted out of the mainstream, he would like to illuminate some general truths about the practice of mainstream medicine. However, I think his success in doing so is limited, rarely rising above statement of the obvious. By focusing his microscope only on family practitioners working in Maine, the generalizability of any lessons they might offer is questionable. The needs of communities in Maine cannot be considered particularly representative of the U.S. in general. So the book never really becomes anything more than a series of isolated vignettes of some individual 'maverick' doctors. Which is interesting as far as it goes, but I wish McPhee had been able to do more with the material. By the end I felt that an opportunity had been missed."

McPhee is careful not to mythologize these real people--they are not SuperDocs, but they are truly admirable human beings. And, of course, since he's a brilliant writer, McPhee has fun describing doctors and patients and adding the occasional clever spin, or twist, or joke. My favorite is this phrase ...the town's other doctor wears a cross in his lapel and has personally been obstetricated twice. which sent me to Google in vain before I realized it was the medical equivalent of \"born again.\""

        "text":"This book jumps a lot which McPhee employing several different narrative and investigative writing styles. The beginning and throughout are too choppy moving from one patient to next as to imitate the sense the family\/general practitioner may experience seeing many diverse patients consecutively. While this may mirror the feeling of witnessing a quick patient turnover, I would have appreciated it if McPhee used his interviewing skills to investigate further and provide more information than just the superficial. Even if decisions are made quickly, they require years of experience to make. The big question of the book is whether General Practice is justified in modern medicine as a specialty and whether its doctors can keep up with the vastness of knowledge. He makes the case that in rural areas, as in Maine where the book is set, that only GPs have the interest and time to get to know and follow generations of families. It also appears that the GPs knowledge is mostly too superficial to meet the need. In all, I wish McPhee would have gone more in-depth with both the medical diagnoses and the interpersonal interactions. He reveals, to his credit, a lot on inter-doctoring politics and territory grabs. It would be interesting to read essays on other medical specialties."

Still, I gather from talking to medical professionals that it can be difficult to convince medical students and residents to seriously consider a career in family medicine. And that's at the world-famous medical center in the city where I live. In any event, as always with McPhee, \"Heirs of General Practice\" is well written, with subtle humor and quiet empathy.

McPhee gives small glimpses into the lives of doctors who have chosen to practice family medicine. They subscribe to the idea that if a doctor treats your parents, your grandparents and your extended family, they will be more skillful at treating you. This is the story of the Family Medicine Institute in Augusta, Maine. And how it has revolutionized small town medicine. McPhee follows a group of residents of The Dartmouth Family Practice and shows with honesty and berevity, the types of patients these doctors see on a daily basis. I may also be partial, because my grandfather was a major player in the forming of The Family Medicine Institute. If any form of medicine interests you, definitely read this book!"

The stories are straightforward, and there are not too many difficult words except for the medical terms.

McPhee gives small glimpses into the lives of doctors who have chosen to practice family medicine. They subscribe to the idea that if a doctor treats your parents, your grandparents and your extended family, they will be more skillful at treating you. This is the story of the Family Medicine Institute in Augusta, Maine. And how it has revolutionized small town medicine. McPhee follows a group of residents of The Dartmouth Family Practice and shows with honesty and berevity, the types of patients these doctors see on a daily basis. I may also be partial, because my grandfather was a major player in the forming of The Family Medicine Institute. If any form of medicine interests you, definitely read this book!"

Thus it had a rather fragmented structure, so trying to read more than a dozen of pages at a time can get a bit tiring after a while. However, because you can read a few paragraphs at a time without losing the plot, I think it is good for being used as an English reader for EFL learners. The stories are straightforward, and there are not too many difficult words except for the medical terms. I am amazed at how well the GPs know their patients given that they have 2000 to 3000 families to care for. I think my class mistresses while I was at secondary school (like the book in the 80s) with a class size under 40, knew so much less about us."

Ailments haven't changed much, really, and I suspect Maine, where most of the doctoring in this book takes place, hasn't changed much either. I read McPhee because he has a way with words, like describing the doctor who wears a cross in his lapel and has personally been obstetricated twice. I also read him because of the cool things I learn. Like about the condition called \"Iowa ear\". The farmer on his tractor looks over his right shoulder, watching his planter or plow and sighting back down the row. This aims his left ear toward the tractor's engine. Which causes hearing loss, invariably in the left ear. It's hard to describe how happy knowing that little chestnut makes me.

He surrounds vignettes of doctors and the patients they see with context around the development of the field of family medicine and the cultural context of rural Maine, and writes in an engaging and accessible voice."

McPhee gives small glimpses into the lives of doctors who have chosen to practice family medicine. They subscribe to the idea that if a doctor treats your parents, your grandparents and your extended family, they will be more skillful at treating you. This is the story of the Family Medicine Institute in Augusta, Maine. And how it has revolutionized small town medicine. McPhee follows a group of residents of The Dartmouth Family Practice and shows with honesty and berevity, the types of patients these doctors see on a daily basis. I may also be partial, because my grandfather was a major player in the forming of The Family Medicine Institute. If any form of medicine interests you, definitely read this book!"

Thus it had a rather fragmented structure, so trying to read more than a dozen of pages at a time can get a bit tiring after a while. However, because you can read a few paragraphs at a time without losing the plot, I think it is good for being used as an English reader for EFL learners. The stories are straightforward, and there are not too many difficult words except for the medical terms. I am amazed at how well the GPs know their patients given that they have 2000 to 3000 families to care for. I think my class mistresses while I was at secondary school (like the book in the 80s) with a class size under 40, knew so much less about us."

Here, at his adventurous best, he is out and about with people who work in freight transportation. Over the past eight years, John McPhee has spent considerable time in the company of people who work in freight transportation. Uncommon Carriers is his sketchbook of them and of his journeys with them. He rides from Atlanta to Tacoma alongside Don Ainsworth, owner and operator of a sixty-five-foot, eighteen-wheel chemical tanker carrying hazmats. McPhee attends ship-handling school on a pond in the foothills of the French Alps, where, for a tuition of $15,000 a week, skippers of the largest ocean ships refine their capabilities in twenty-foot scale models. He goes up the tight-assed Illinois River on a towboat pushing a triple string of barges, the overall vessel being a good deal longer than the Titanic . And he travels by canoe up the canal-and-lock commercial waterways traveled by Henry David Thoreau and his brother, John, in a homemade skiff in 1839. Uncommon Carriers is classic work by McPhee, in prose distinguished, as always, by its author's warm humor, keen insight, and rich sense of human character.",

        "text":"For 35 years I did what I did (fairly enjoying the first 34). John McPhee, in this book, lets me imagine a few other trades: Tony in the cab of an 18-wheeler, carrying hazmat; Tony pushing a thousand feet of (15) barges up the \"tight-assed\" Illinois River; Tony sorting packages in a UPS center, letting UPS pay for my college; Tony in a coal train, wearing a T-shirt that says, \"UNION FISH STRIKE MORE\". On my days off, I'd paddle a canoe one week with my brother on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers, just like those Thoreau boys once did, but with likely more beer. Forget that I'd wreck, crash, get my head severed in a quick stop. I'm reading; and I can do anything. No, this did not make me want to take a course on operating an ocean liner, which McPhee did; but I indulged myself in meeting wonderful characters -- better than fictional ones. Like the hazmat driver who turns to McPhee and says, \"Do you know of a writer named Joan Didion?\" (McPhee: I was too shy to say, \"Take the 'of' out. \") He's read McCarthy's The Border Trilogy three times because, like Moby-Dick , \"you learn something new every time.\" He shares an argot (murdercycles, speedo (speeding ticket), lollipop (mile marker)) but also sprinkles in \"paucity\" and speaks of \"circadian rhythms\". McPhee tells us: He said \"shit\" and \"fuck\" probably no more than you do. And I learned stuff . I learned that the French coined the name \"Illinois\" but \"are not responsible for Ill Annoy.\" I learned about the classic sound of locomotives: As the clarinettist Skip Livingston e-mailed the tubist Tom Spain, \"I've been listening carefully. The trains differ--different locomotives have different pitches to their horns. But I did hear one while I was moving snow on Sunday morning, and I was able to get to the piano before I lost the notes. They were A-sharp, E, and F-sharp below middle C, which made it sound like an F-sharp-7 chord (minus the C-sharp). The instruments that would come closest to the sound would probably be trombones.\" I learned this about railroad grades: The steepest mainline railroad grade in the United States is Saluda Hill, coming off the Blue Ridge of North Carolina at five per cent--a thousand vertical feet in four miles. It is not presently used. To get up it, trains were cut into thirds. To get down it, Dick Eisfeller says, \"they were extremely careful, put it that way.\" I learned that San Diego, thinking itself pretty, has few truck stops. \"They have no support structure for trucks. The closest real truck stop east is at a casino sixty miles away. The closest to the north is Los Angeles County; to the south, in Mexico. To the west, nothing, for obvious reasons.\" And I learned the difference between a Jehovah's Witness and the door of a Freightliner: You can close the door on a Jehovah's Witness."

        "text":"“On the horizon there were no trees. Deer and antelope were everywhere at play, much too young to care what had happened to the range...\" -- John McPhee, Uncommon Carriers McPhee is one of my favorites. I think his strongest form is the long-essay and I love his collections that are thematic. Uncommon carriers delivered exactly what I wanted with a bunch of surprises. Like always, McPhee is able to mix together great characters, fantastic observations, and a real sense of space and place and tell a story that illuminates some place or time that you have probably driven past without noticing a hundred times before. McPhee has a a geologist's curiosity and patience (and a poet's pen) that allows him to spend an inordinate amount of time with a story to get that one detail that turns a good essay about boats into a fantastic essay about the craft of work, the beauty of place, the magnificence of the ordinary. The magic of McPhee isn't just that he writes new journalism almost better than anyone else on the planet, it is that he does more of it than almost anyone else. Up McPhee's other sleeve is his ability to make you want to follow him on his explorations. He isn't going to chase down your interests (rock stars, movies, money). Instead, McPhee is going to carefully let you follow him down his rabbit holes and help you onto his hobby-horses. I would also be remiss if I didn't include a part of one of my favorite paragraphs. A barge McPhee is on, is flashed by a woman on a pleasure boat on the Missouri river. Here is McPhee's response: She has golden hair. She has the sort of body you go to see in marble. She holds her poise without retreat. In her ample presentation there is a defiance of gravity. There is no angle of repose. She is a siren and these are her songs. She is Henry Moore's \"Oval with Points\"."

One of my favorite episodes: The truckers all stare at him, so he buys a cap with a gold visor, an American flag, and so on. Now he fits right in. Nice science fact worth remembering: Bernoulli's Principle--where the flow is fastest, pressure is lowest--holds airplanes in the sky. He shows how lobsters are shipped around the world. Lobsters are to Christmas dinners in France what turkeys are in America. Shipping live lobsters around the world is just animal cruelty in my view. At a public hearing, Wyoming officials outline how they plan to sterilize coyotes. One rancher says, \"We don't want to fuck the coyotes, we want to get rid of them.\" There is an underlying failure of getting along with nature throughout the book. T-shirt on a fisherman: \"UNION FISH STRIKE MORE.\" Dick Eisfeller of Greenland NH films trains for a living. He will film for 24 hours straight without sleeping at times."

        "text":"There is a growing branch of literature which consists of nonfiction. How is that possible? The Nobel Prize for Literature in 1996 was awarded to Svetlana Alexievich of Belarus for her work, which consists primarily of interviews of people affected by the nuclear accident at Chernobyl or the Soviet War in Afghanistan. As for Americans, we have John McPhee , who has written a series of nonfiction works of high literary quality. I have just finished reading his Uncommon Carriers , which deals, in turn, with long-haul truckers; a place in France where ships’ pilots are trained; boats that tow barges on American rivers; the parcel sorting services of UPS; and mile-and-a-half-long coal trains. In between, there is a delightful essay by the author about retracing the route of Henry David Thoreau and his brother John described in A Week on the Concord and Merrimac Rivers —which I had read when it was first published in the New Yorker . McPhee likes to take what looks like a boring subject that nobody would write about and turn it into a gem. For instance, there is that tetralogy he wrote about American geology beginning with Basin and Range and ending with Assembling California . One would think that McPhee’s books might be a tad boring, but they never are."

Was the author accurately quoting his sources? No doubt. Are there other ways to tell the story without actually quoting the profanity? Of course. Most authors did so routinely until, oh, the past 20 or 30 years or so. I realize there are those who think writing is somehow better or more honest because the actual, repulsive language is used. I quite disagree. If you use foul language on a Duluth Transit Authority bus, the driver will immediately inform you that you must stop using this language or you will have to leave the bus. I think this is a good rule. It applies to my car. It applies to CDs I listen to on my car. The common use of coarse language in our society has not improved society in any way, it has just made it ... coarse. The first seven discs had some interesting material. They contained the amount of coarse language that I have somehow come to find acceptable, or at least tolerable."

        "text":"Divided into six sections based on the mode of \"carrier\" McPhee is traveling with: HAZMAT truck drivers, Ocean-going cargo ships, Mississippi river barges, Canals of the northeast, UPS\/FedEx and deliveries, Freight trains. Most scientifically fascinating was the cargo ship piece where McPhee attends training school for the captains and skippers of these massive vessels. On a lake in Switzerland, they train using life-size-yet-scaled models. One trainee is practicing a docking maneuver and parks an impressive 6 inches from the pier. The teacher reminds him that at full scale, he's something like 15 yards away. If the birds on the shore of the lake were at full scale, they would be 6 feet tall. The canal chapter is a total waste- McPhee and a friend follow Thoreau's canoe trip up the Hudson to some spot in Mass. Yawn. My favorite of course was the truck driving chapter. Not only is it charming and interesting, it spoke to a deep longing to be a truck driver myself. In his epilogue, McPhee revisits truckers saying that \"the late-night hum at hundreds of truck stops across America is a quintessential piece of our sonic landscape.\" Indeed. Unfortunately this was a book-on-mp3, and McPhee is no voice actor. I was actually stunned to hear a director listed in the \"credits,\" since I had sort of assumed McPhee just decided to settle in with a cup of tea one afternoon and read his whole book quietly to himself. Recommend to anyone interested in quirky engineering and\/or is consumed by a burning desire to drive a big piece of machinery."

        "text":"This book is too short for it to have taken me over a month to read it. Why so long? Well, despite enjoying McPhee's writing overall, I found the book slightly boring. I was interested in most of the topics and late in the book I realized the problem here was he’s provided way too much information, too many details. So, maybe I wasn't quite that interested, maybe. The first chapter, A Fleet of One, I enjoyed the most. It’s about a trucker, an owner-operator who specializes in hazardous liquid materials. He's been on the road for decades. The last chapter returned to the same trucker, although I wouldn't say it added much of anything new; and happily, was quite short compared to the other chapters. McPhee rode with him again, three years later and perhaps just had to add that into the book. The next chapter, or essay, as it were, is called The Ships of Port Revel and is a training course for ship captains and ship pilots. They come from all over the world to train there for a week. It was somewhat interesting, and the shortest of all the essays. The third essay, Tight-Assed River, started out okay, but went on way too long. It’s double the length of the essay before it and had many details that literally put me to sleep. Here the book really lagged for me, too much information. Oh, it’s about a barge carrying freight along the Illinois River. The middle essay called, Five Days on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers, was somewhat different than the others. Thus far, the collection is about work, mainly shipping in different formats (carriers). This one instead has the author and his son-in-law retracing the journey that Henry David Thoreau and his brother took many years before, which was recounted in HDT’s first book with a very similar name. While I mainly enjoyed this essay, the comparison from then and now (being 2003), it doesn’t fit with the theme the other essays. The next essay didn’t fit well either, called Out in the Sort. It’s about a company that ships fresh lobster all around the world, the largest lobster company. Then it morphs into what UPS, United Parcel Service, can do for you. One could say a meandering essay, and perhaps covers shipping via airplane. Then we have Coal Train, which is about what it says, about shipping coal via train. This essay is the longest and by far could have been cut in half. It went on for too many pages, with too many details, that maybe a train buff, train spotter, what-have you would enjoy, or not. Then the last I’ve already mentioned. This book has not put me off of McPhee’s writing, but it may be a while before I jump into another collection of his essays."

        "text":"In the early 2000s John McPhee managed to hitch a ride with a number of guys (yes, all men) who were highly skilled in transporting bulk goods: 18-wheel truck drivers, coal train engineers, towboat captains, ocean-going bulk carrier captains, and others. This book is basically a series of essays about what it takes to move America's goods. It's a fascinating look at the skills and experience it takes to operate massive vehicles and vessels like these. The language can be rough, and the cigarette smoke can be thick, but you learn a lot about what it takes to do these jobs. They are often dangerous with little room for error. Until recently we sort of took our supply chain for granted. No more. Now you can read about how the supply chain operated before all hell broke loose three years ago. McPhee recreates the feeling of being in the cabin with these guys, as he uses their slang often without explaining what it means – you pick it up in context. It's an absorbing way to tell their stories."

        "text":"I loved this book. I actually read the sections when they appeared in The New Yorker. I assume few changes were made. McPhee must have the best job in the world getting to ride with an over-the-road trucker across the United States; traveling down the Illinois River on a towboat and linked barges (something I've always really wanted to do down the Mississippi with a friend of mine]; and following freight trains from the cab. Talk about your Walter Mitty! His articles and books are filled with juicy little tidbits of detail that I just love reading about. I love going to locks on the Mississippi and watching the towboats shepherd their charges down the river and through the locks. Another good site to watch is Starved Rock State Park along the Illinois river. Here's my review on the towboat going down the Illinois section of McPhee's book: The Illinois River is third in freight carried, following the Mississippi and the Ohio. It's a relatively straight river except for some \"corkscrew\" bends near Pekin. The barges that navigate the Illinois can be huge. The Billy Joe Boling that McPhee is riding (some people get all the fun) is pushing a toe longer than the new Queen Mary 2, the longest ocean liner ever built. Maneuvering such a \"vessel\" takes skill and sang-froid. At its widest point, this collection of barges and towboat is four times longer than the river's 300 foot width. The Illinois is an autocthonous river (a word I learned from Founding Fish but will probably forget) beginning not far from Chicago. This particular barge string has fifteen barges wired together carrying pig iron, steel and fertilizer. The ones with pig iron appear empty, but the iron is so heavy and the river channel only nine feet deep at its minimum, that the barges can only be loaded to about 10 per cent of capacity. The steel cable holding the barges together is about an inch thick and the deck hands need to constantly monitor the tension of the wire.. The barges and tug at the stern become almost a rigid unit. The pilot has to steer this mass carefully between railroad bridge pilings and other obstructions. The pilot \"is steering the Queen Mary up an undersized river and he is luxuriating in six feet of clearnace.\" Meanwhile at the stern, behind the stern rail of the towboat, only ten feet away, is the riverbank. This assumes no unusual current changes. On the Mississippi, a tow can consists of as many as forty-nine barges and be two hundred and fifty feet wide. When they arrive at the Illinois, the consist needs to be broken up into smaller groups. Just by way of comparison, a fifteen barge tow can carry as much as 870 eighteen wheelers on the highway. All captains have to start as deckhands, and it's not unstressful. One physician who had been asked to study how pilots and captains handled stress, had to leave the boat because he couldn't handle the stress. The river is rarely empty and you can count on being approached by another thousand-foot tow coming at you down the river. Downstream tows always have the right of way. Hold spots, where a tow can be headed into the bank to wait for a downstream tow to pass, are plotted ahead of time and serve like railroad sidings. There is no dispatcher and the captains call traffic themselves announcing their location. A large tow will burn about one gallon each two hundred feet or twenty-four hundred gallons of diesel fuel per day. Measured by fuel consumed per ton-mile, barges are \"two and a half times more efficient than a freight train, nearly nine times more efficient than a truck.\" There aren't too many locks on the Illinois as the river drops only about ninety feet, but watching a tow go through one can provide hours of entertainment. I remember sitting at the lock across from Starved Rock State Park as a long tow broke into two sections to get through the lock. Unfortunately, pleasure boat operators being \"ignorant, ignorant, ignorant,\" accidents happen. Much like train engineers, towboat captains fear boaters who won't get out of the way. It's impossible to steer around a small boat and the prop wash and propeller suction can be lethal to the unwary. and the section on trains: Driving a train would seem simple enough: you push the lever forward and off you go. Not so. Coal trains, of which just one power plant in Georgia requires 3 fully loaded trains per day to keep running, are usually more than one and one-half miles long and weigh 34,000 tons. They are by far the heaviest trains on the rails. The train is so long that the engine in front (these trains must have engines in front and back and often in the middle as well to adjust the strain on the couplers) will often be applying the brakes going down hill while the engines in back are pushing the cars still going up the other side of the rise. They can't go up hills, per se. A slop of even 1.5% makes the engines work hard. Twenty-three thousand coal trains leave the Powder River basin every year; that's thirty-four thousand miles of rolling coal in a never ending stream of coal for power plants. The Powder River basin coal generates less heat, i.e. fewer BTU's than eastern coal, but it has a much lower sulfur content so following stricter environmental regulations eastern mines have been dying while western ones are thriving. That's where the railroads come in. Plant Scherer in Georgia, a large power plant, usually has a one-million-ton pile of coal in reserve. To understand the revived interest in nuclear power, that pile generates the equivalent of one truckload of mined uranium. \"To get a million BTUs, fuel oil costs nine dollars (before recent price increases,) natural gas six dollars, coal one-dollar-eighty-five, and nuclear fifty cents.\" \"Plant Scherer burns the contents of thirteen hundred coal trains per year -- two thousand miles of coal cars, twelve million tons of the bedrock of Wyoming.\" The plant requires twelve thousand acres to store, process and burn the coal. Think about that the next time you turn the lights on."

The first, last, and by far most compelling tells the story of a long-haul trucker -- a driver that owns his own rig and tank, transporting various goods. There's something deeply satisfying about seeing a real expert at work: someone that not only knows how to do their job well, but truly and deeply knows how to handle any eventuality effortlessly. The truck driver in this book is unquestionably an expert of that variety. Unfortunately, the other stories aren't quite as interesting. A few of them are interesting enough -- although not up to the standard of the first one -- but the rest are sub-par. One is about Thoreau's travels with his brother, that the author replicates -- somewhat. It seems out of place, compared to the rest of the pieces, and it's not even that enjoyable to read. There's another piece on UPS, which should have been a highlight (goodness knows that there is a huge untapped mine of stories there) but was only so-so: some parts of that one are enjoyable to read, but those parts are more about UPS's anonymous subcontracting of, well, almost anything (laptop repair, order fulfillment, etc), and not about transportation. In the end, I really enjoyed this book. I just wish the author would have dropped about half of it, and either expanded the rest or found other high-quality segments to replace it."

He finds himself in an eighteen-wheel chemical tanker with hazmat materials inside, a towboat pushing a triple load of barges up the Illinois River and in the cabs of 150-car long coal trains traversing Nebraska and Wyoming. He also spends time inside a major hub for UPS with four million square feet of floor space at the Louisville Airport located between parallel runways just to see how zillions of packages are correctly routed into trucks and planes. Oh, and he follows the path of Henry David Thoreau & his brother John down the Concord and Merrimack Rivers in a sixteen-foot canoe. The craziest \"trip\" was at a lake in French Alps where--for $15,000 per week--captains of huge ocean going liners \"practice\" with twenty-foot scale models for any eventuality that might occur on the high seas. In the course of these travels, the author weaves a lot of local history into his travels along with a great deal of humor and insight. This book is a fascinating ride (pun intended) into worlds that the average American never visits."

John McPhee, in this book, lets me imagine a few other trades: Tony in the cab of an 18-wheeler, carrying hazmat; Tony pushing a thousand feet of (15) barges up the \"tight-assed\" Illinois River; Tony sorting packages in a UPS center, letting UPS pay for my college; Tony in a coal train, wearing a T-shirt that says, \"UNION FISH STRIKE MORE\". On my days off, I'd paddle a canoe one week with my brother on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers, just like those Thoreau boys once did, but with likely more beer. Forget that I'd wreck, crash, get my head severed in a quick stop. I'm reading; and I can do anything. No, this did not make me want to take a course on operating an ocean liner, which McPhee did; but I indulged myself in meeting wonderful characters -- better than fictional ones. Like the hazmat driver who turns to McPhee and says, \"Do you know of a writer named Joan Didion?\" (McPhee: I was too shy to say, \"Take the 'of' out. \") He's read McCarthy's The Border Trilogy three times because, like Moby-Dick , \"you learn something new every time.\" He shares an argot (murdercycles, speedo (speeding ticket), lollipop (mile marker)) but also sprinkles in \"paucity\" and speaks of \"circadian rhythms\". McPhee tells us: He said \"shit\" and \"fuck\" probably no more than you do. And I learned stuff . I learned that the French coined the name \"Illinois\" but \"are not responsible for Ill Annoy.\" I learned about the classic sound of locomotives: As the clarinettist Skip Livingston e-mailed the tubist Tom Spain, \"I've been listening carefully. The trains differ--different locomotives have different pitches to their horns. But I did hear one while I was moving snow on Sunday morning, and I was able to get to the piano before I lost the notes. They were A-sharp, E, and F-sharp below middle C, which made it sound like an F-sharp-7 chord (minus the C-sharp). The instruments that would come closest to the sound would probably be trombones.\" I learned this about railroad grades: The steepest mainline railroad grade in the United States is Saluda Hill, coming off the Blue Ridge of North Carolina at five per cent--a thousand vertical feet in four miles. It is not presently used. To get up it, trains were cut into thirds. To get down it, Dick Eisfeller says, \"they were extremely careful, put it that way.\" I learned that San Diego, thinking itself pretty, has few truck stops. \"They have no support structure for trucks. The closest real truck stop east is at a casino sixty miles away. The closest to the north is Los Angeles County; to the south, in Mexico. To the west, nothing, for obvious reasons.\" And I learned the difference between a Jehovah's Witness and the door of a Freightliner: You can close the door on a Jehovah's Witness."

Deer and antelope were everywhere at play, much too young to care what had happened to the range...\" -- John McPhee, Uncommon Carriers McPhee is one of my favorites. I think his strongest form is the long-essay and I love his collections that are thematic. Uncommon carriers delivered exactly what I wanted with a bunch of surprises. Like always, McPhee is able to mix together great characters, fantastic observations, and a real sense of space and place and tell a story that illuminates some place or time that you have probably driven past without noticing a hundred times before. McPhee has a a geologist's curiosity and patience (and a poet's pen) that allows him to spend an inordinate amount of time with a story to get that one detail that turns a good essay about boats into a fantastic essay about the craft of work, the beauty of place, the magnificence of the ordinary. The magic of McPhee isn't just that he writes new journalism almost better than anyone else on the planet, it is that he does more of it than almost anyone else. Up McPhee's other sleeve is his ability to make you want to follow him on his explorations. He isn't going to chase down your interests (rock stars, movies, money). Instead, McPhee is going to carefully let you follow him down his rabbit holes and help you onto his hobby-horses. I would also be remiss if I didn't include a part of one of my favorite paragraphs. A barge McPhee is on, is flashed by a woman on a pleasure boat on the Missouri river. Here is McPhee's response: She has golden hair. She has the sort of body you go to see in marble. She holds her poise without retreat. In her ample presentation there is a defiance of gravity. There is no angle of repose. She is a siren and these are her songs. She is Henry Moore's \"Oval with Points\"."

As for Americans, we have John McPhee , who has written a series of nonfiction works of high literary quality. I have just finished reading his Uncommon Carriers , which deals, in turn, with long-haul truckers; a place in France where ships’ pilots are trained; boats that tow barges on American rivers; the parcel sorting services of UPS; and mile-and-a-half-long coal trains. In between, there is a delightful essay by the author about retracing the route of Henry David Thoreau and his brother John described in A Week on the Concord and Merrimac Rivers —which I had read when it was first published in the New Yorker . McPhee likes to take what looks like a boring subject that nobody would write about and turn it into a gem.

Most authors did so routinely until, oh, the past 20 or 30 years or so. I realize there are those who think writing is somehow better or more honest because the actual, repulsive language is used. I quite disagree. If you use foul language on a Duluth Transit Authority bus, the driver will immediately inform you that you must stop using this language or you will have to leave the bus. I think this is a good rule. It applies to my car. It applies to CDs I listen to on my car.

Most scientifically fascinating was the cargo ship piece where McPhee attends training school for the captains and skippers of these massive vessels. On a lake in Switzerland, they train using life-size-yet-scaled models. One trainee is practicing a docking maneuver and parks an impressive 6 inches from the pier. The teacher reminds him that at full scale, he's something like 15 yards away. If the birds on the shore of the lake were at full scale, they would be 6 feet tall. The canal chapter is a total waste- McPhee and a friend follow Thoreau's canoe trip up the Hudson to some spot in Mass. Yawn. My favorite of course was the truck driving chapter. Not only is it charming and interesting, it spoke to a deep longing to be a truck driver myself. In his epilogue, McPhee revisits truckers saying that \"the late-night hum at hundreds of truck stops across America is a quintessential piece of our sonic landscape.\" Indeed. Unfortunately this was a book-on-mp3, and McPhee is no voice actor. I was actually stunned to hear a director listed in the \"credits,\" since I had sort of assumed McPhee just decided to settle in with a cup of tea one afternoon and read his whole book quietly to himself.

I was interested in most of the topics and late in the book I realized the problem here was he’s provided way too much information, too many details. So, maybe I wasn't quite that interested, maybe. The first chapter, A Fleet of One, I enjoyed the most. It’s about a trucker, an owner-operator who specializes in hazardous liquid materials. He's been on the road for decades. The last chapter returned to the same trucker, although I wouldn't say it added much of anything new; and happily, was quite short compared to the other chapters. McPhee rode with him again, three years later and perhaps just had to add that into the book. The next chapter, or essay, as it were, is called The Ships of Port Revel and is a training course for ship captains and ship pilots. They come from all over the world to train there for a week. It was somewhat interesting, and the shortest of all the essays. The third essay, Tight-Assed River, started out okay, but went on way too long. It’s double the length of the essay before it and had many details that literally put me to sleep. Here the book really lagged for me, too much information. Oh, it’s about a barge carrying freight along the Illinois River. The middle essay called, Five Days on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers, was somewhat different than the others. Thus far, the collection is about work, mainly shipping in different formats (carriers). This one instead has the author and his son-in-law retracing the journey that Henry David Thoreau and his brother took many years before, which was recounted in HDT’s first book with a very similar name. While I mainly enjoyed this essay, the comparison from then and now (being 2003), it doesn’t fit with the theme the other essays. The next essay didn’t fit well either, called Out in the Sort. It’s about a company that ships fresh lobster all around the world, the largest lobster company. Then it morphs into what UPS, United Parcel Service, can do for you. One could say a meandering essay, and perhaps covers shipping via airplane. Then we have Coal Train, which is about what it says, about shipping coal via train. This essay is the longest and by far could have been cut in half. It went on for too many pages, with too many details, that maybe a train buff, train spotter, what-have you would enjoy, or not. Then the last I’ve already mentioned. This book has not put me off of McPhee’s writing, but it may be a while before I jump into another collection of his essays."

This book is basically a series of essays about what it takes to move America's goods. It's a fascinating look at the skills and experience it takes to operate massive vehicles and vessels like these. The language can be rough, and the cigarette smoke can be thick, but you learn a lot about what it takes to do these jobs. They are often dangerous with little room for error. Until recently we sort of took our supply chain for granted. No more. Now you can read about how the supply chain operated before all hell broke loose three years ago. McPhee recreates the feeling of being in the cabin with these guys, as he uses their slang often without explaining what it means – you pick it up in context.

McPhee must have the best job in the world getting to ride with an over-the-road trucker across the United States; traveling down the Illinois River on a towboat and linked barges (something I've always really wanted to do down the Mississippi with a friend of mine]; and following freight trains from the cab. Talk about your Walter Mitty! His articles and books are filled with juicy little tidbits of detail that I just love reading about. I love going to locks on the Mississippi and watching the towboats shepherd their charges down the river and through the locks. Another good site to watch is Starved Rock State Park along the Illinois river. Here's my review on the towboat going down the Illinois section of McPhee's book: The Illinois River is third in freight carried, following the Mississippi and the Ohio. It's a relatively straight river except for some \"corkscrew\" bends near Pekin. The barges that navigate the Illinois can be huge. The Billy Joe Boling that McPhee is riding (some people get all the fun) is pushing a toe longer than the new Queen Mary 2, the longest ocean liner ever built. Maneuvering such a \"vessel\" takes skill and sang-froid. At its widest point, this collection of barges and towboat is four times longer than the river's 300 foot width. The Illinois is an autocthonous river (a word I learned from Founding Fish but will probably forget) beginning not far from Chicago. This particular barge string has fifteen barges wired together carrying pig iron, steel and fertilizer. The ones with pig iron appear empty, but the iron is so heavy and the river channel only nine feet deep at its minimum, that the barges can only be loaded to about 10 per cent of capacity. The steel cable holding the barges together is about an inch thick and the deck hands need to constantly monitor the tension of the wire.. The barges and tug at the stern become almost a rigid unit. The pilot has to steer this mass carefully between railroad bridge pilings and other obstructions. The pilot \"is steering the Queen Mary up an undersized river and he is luxuriating in six feet of clearnace.\" Meanwhile at the stern, behind the stern rail of the towboat, only ten feet away, is the riverbank. This assumes no unusual current changes. On the Mississippi, a tow can consists of as many as forty-nine barges and be two hundred and fifty feet wide. When they arrive at the Illinois, the consist needs to be broken up into smaller groups. Just by way of comparison, a fifteen barge tow can carry as much as 870 eighteen wheelers on the highway. All captains have to start as deckhands, and it's not unstressful. One physician who had been asked to study how pilots and captains handled stress, had to leave the boat because he couldn't handle the stress. The river is rarely empty and you can count on being approached by another thousand-foot tow coming at you down the river. Downstream tows always have the right of way. Hold spots, where a tow can be headed into the bank to wait for a downstream tow to pass, are plotted ahead of time and serve like railroad sidings. There is no dispatcher and the captains call traffic themselves announcing their location. A large tow will burn about one gallon each two hundred feet or twenty-four hundred gallons of diesel fuel per day. Measured by fuel consumed per ton-mile, barges are \"two and a half times more efficient than a freight train, nearly nine times more efficient than a truck.\" There aren't too many locks on the Illinois as the river drops only about ninety feet, but watching a tow go through one can provide hours of entertainment. I remember sitting at the lock across from Starved Rock State Park as a long tow broke into two sections to get through the lock. Unfortunately, pleasure boat operators being \"ignorant, ignorant, ignorant,\" accidents happen. Much like train engineers, towboat captains fear boaters who won't get out of the way. It's impossible to steer around a small boat and the prop wash and propeller suction can be lethal to the unwary. and the section on trains: Driving a train would seem simple enough: you push the lever forward and off you go. Not so. Coal trains, of which just one power plant in Georgia requires 3 fully loaded trains per day to keep running, are usually more than one and one-half miles long and weigh 34,000 tons. They are by far the heaviest trains on the rails. The train is so long that the engine in front (these trains must have engines in front and back and often in the middle as well to adjust the strain on the couplers) will often be applying the brakes going down hill while the engines in back are pushing the cars still going up the other side of the rise. They can't go up hills, per se. A slop of even 1.5% makes the engines work hard. Twenty-three thousand coal trains leave the Powder River basin every year; that's thirty-four thousand miles of rolling coal in a never ending stream of coal for power plants. The Powder River basin coal generates less heat, i.e. fewer BTU's than eastern coal, but it has a much lower sulfur content so following stricter environmental regulations eastern mines have been dying while western ones are thriving. That's where the railroads come in. Plant Scherer in Georgia, a large power plant, usually has a one-million-ton pile of coal in reserve. To understand the revived interest in nuclear power, that pile generates the equivalent of one truckload of mined uranium. \"To get a million BTUs, fuel oil costs nine dollars (before recent price increases,) natural gas six dollars, coal one-dollar-eighty-five, and nuclear fifty cents.\" \"Plant Scherer burns the contents of thirteen hundred coal trains per year -- two thousand miles of coal cars, twelve million tons of the bedrock of Wyoming.\" The plant requires twelve thousand acres to store, process and burn the coal. Think about that the next time you turn the lights on."

The first, last, and by far most compelling tells the story of a long-haul trucker -- a driver that owns his own rig and tank, transporting various goods. There's something deeply satisfying about seeing a real expert at work: someone that not only knows how to do their job well, but truly and deeply knows how to handle any eventuality effortlessly. The truck driver in this book is unquestionably an expert of that variety. Unfortunately, the other stories aren't quite as interesting. A few of them are interesting enough -- although not up to the standard of the first one -- but the rest are sub-par. One is about Thoreau's travels with his brother, that the author replicates -- somewhat. It seems out of place, compared to the rest of the pieces, and it's not even that enjoyable to read. There's another piece on UPS, which should have been a highlight (goodness knows that there is a huge untapped mine of stories there) but was only so-so: some parts of that one are enjoyable to read, but those parts are more about UPS's anonymous subcontracting of, well, almost anything (laptop repair, order fulfillment, etc), and not about transportation. In the end, I really enjoyed this book. I just wish the author would have dropped about half of it, and either expanded the rest or found other high-quality segments to replace it."

He finds himself in an eighteen-wheel chemical tanker with hazmat materials inside, a towboat pushing a triple load of barges up the Illinois River and in the cabs of 150-car long coal trains traversing Nebraska and Wyoming. He also spends time inside a major hub for UPS with four million square feet of floor space at the Louisville Airport located between parallel runways just to see how zillions of packages are correctly routed into trucks and planes. Oh, and he follows the path of Henry David Thoreau & his brother John down the Concord and Merrimack Rivers in a sixteen-foot canoe. The craziest \"trip\" was at a lake in French Alps where--for $15,000 per week--captains of huge ocean going liners \"practice\" with twenty-foot scale models for any eventuality that might occur on the high seas. In the course of these travels, the author weaves a lot of local history into his travels along with a great deal of humor and insight. This book is a fascinating ride (pun intended) into worlds that the average American never visits."

John McPhee, in this book, lets me imagine a few other trades: Tony in the cab of an 18-wheeler, carrying hazmat; Tony pushing a thousand feet of (15) barges up the \"tight-assed\" Illinois River; Tony sorting packages in a UPS center, letting UPS pay for my college; Tony in a coal train, wearing a T-shirt that says, \"UNION FISH STRIKE MORE\". On my days off, I'd paddle a canoe one week with my brother on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers, just like those Thoreau boys once did, but with likely more beer. Forget that I'd wreck, crash, get my head severed in a quick stop. I'm reading; and I can do anything. No, this did not make me want to take a course on operating an ocean liner, which McPhee did; but I indulged myself in meeting wonderful characters -- better than fictional ones. Like the hazmat driver who turns to McPhee and says, \"Do you know of a writer named Joan Didion?\" (McPhee: I was too shy to say, \"Take the 'of' out. \") He's read McCarthy's The Border Trilogy three times because, like Moby-Dick , \"you learn something new every time.\" He shares an argot (murdercycles, speedo (speeding ticket), lollipop (mile marker)) but also sprinkles in \"paucity\" and speaks of \"circadian rhythms\". McPhee tells us: He said \"shit\" and \"fuck\" probably no more than you do. And I learned stuff . I learned that the French coined the name \"Illinois\" but \"are not responsible for Ill Annoy.\" I learned about the classic sound of locomotives: As the clarinettist Skip Livingston e-mailed the tubist Tom Spain, \"I've been listening carefully. The trains differ--different locomotives have different pitches to their horns. But I did hear one while I was moving snow on Sunday morning, and I was able to get to the piano before I lost the notes. They were A-sharp, E, and F-sharp below middle C, which made it sound like an F-sharp-7 chord (minus the C-sharp). The instruments that would come closest to the sound would probably be trombones.\" I learned this about railroad grades: The steepest mainline railroad grade in the United States is Saluda Hill, coming off the Blue Ridge of North Carolina at five per cent--a thousand vertical feet in four miles. It is not presently used. To get up it, trains were cut into thirds. To get down it, Dick Eisfeller says, \"they were extremely careful, put it that way.\" I learned that San Diego, thinking itself pretty, has few truck stops. \"They have no support structure for trucks. The closest real truck stop east is at a casino sixty miles away. The closest to the north is Los Angeles County; to the south, in Mexico. To the west, nothing, for obvious reasons.\" And I learned the difference between a Jehovah's Witness and the door of a Freightliner: You can close the door on a Jehovah's Witness."

        "text":"“On the horizon there were no trees. Deer and antelope were everywhere at play, much too young to care what had happened to the range...\" -- John McPhee, Uncommon Carriers McPhee is one of my favorites. I think his strongest form is the long-essay and I love his collections that are thematic. Uncommon carriers delivered exactly what I wanted with a bunch of surprises. Like always, McPhee is able to mix together great characters, fantastic observations, and a real sense of space and place and tell a story that illuminates some place or time that you have probably driven past without noticing a hundred times before. McPhee has a a geologist's curiosity and patience (and a poet's pen) that allows him to spend an inordinate amount of time with a story to get that one detail that turns a good essay about boats into a fantastic essay about the craft of work, the beauty of place, the magnificence of the ordinary. The magic of McPhee isn't just that he writes new journalism almost better than anyone else on the planet, it is that he does more of it than almost anyone else. Up McPhee's other sleeve is his ability to make you want to follow him on his explorations. He isn't going to chase down your interests (rock stars, movies, money). Instead, McPhee is going to carefully let you follow him down his rabbit holes and help you onto his hobby-horses. I would also be remiss if I didn't include a part of one of my favorite paragraphs. A barge McPhee is on, is flashed by a woman on a pleasure boat on the Missouri river. Here is McPhee's response: She has golden hair. She has the sort of body you go to see in marble. She holds her poise without retreat. In her ample presentation there is a defiance of gravity. There is no angle of repose. She is a siren and these are her songs. She is Henry Moore's \"Oval with Points\"."

As for Americans, we have John McPhee , who has written a series of nonfiction works of high literary quality. I have just finished reading his Uncommon Carriers , which deals, in turn, with long-haul truckers; a place in France where ships’ pilots are trained; boats that tow barges on American rivers; the parcel sorting services of UPS; and mile-and-a-half-long coal trains. In between, there is a delightful essay by the author about retracing the route of Henry David Thoreau and his brother John described in A Week on the Concord and Merrimac Rivers —which I had read when it was first published in the New Yorker .

I quite disagree. If you use foul language on a Duluth Transit Authority bus, the driver will immediately inform you that you must stop using this language or you will have to leave the bus.

Most scientifically fascinating was the cargo ship piece where McPhee attends training school for the captains and skippers of these massive vessels. On a lake in Switzerland, they train using life-size-yet-scaled models. One trainee is practicing a docking maneuver and parks an impressive 6 inches from the pier. The teacher reminds him that at full scale, he's something like 15 yards away. If the birds on the shore of the lake were at full scale, they would be 6 feet tall. The canal chapter is a total waste- McPhee and a friend follow Thoreau's canoe trip up the Hudson to some spot in Mass. Yawn. My favorite of course was the truck driving chapter. Not only is it charming and interesting, it spoke to a deep longing to be a truck driver myself. In his epilogue, McPhee revisits truckers saying that \"the late-night hum at hundreds of truck stops across America is a quintessential piece of our sonic landscape.\" Indeed. Unfortunately this was a book-on-mp3, and McPhee is no voice actor. I was actually stunned to hear a director listed in the \"credits,\" since I had sort of assumed McPhee just decided to settle in with a cup of tea one afternoon and read his whole book quietly to himself.

I was interested in most of the topics and late in the book I realized the problem here was he’s provided way too much information, too many details. So, maybe I wasn't quite that interested, maybe. The first chapter, A Fleet of One, I enjoyed the most. It’s about a trucker, an owner-operator who specializes in hazardous liquid materials. He's been on the road for decades. The last chapter returned to the same trucker, although I wouldn't say it added much of anything new; and happily, was quite short compared to the other chapters. McPhee rode with him again, three years later and perhaps just had to add that into the book. The next chapter, or essay, as it were, is called The Ships of Port Revel and is a training course for ship captains and ship pilots. They come from all over the world to train there for a week. It was somewhat interesting, and the shortest of all the essays. The third essay, Tight-Assed River, started out okay, but went on way too long. It’s double the length of the essay before it and had many details that literally put me to sleep. Here the book really lagged for me, too much information. Oh, it’s about a barge carrying freight along the Illinois River. The middle essay called, Five Days on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers, was somewhat different than the others. Thus far, the collection is about work, mainly shipping in different formats (carriers). This one instead has the author and his son-in-law retracing the journey that Henry David Thoreau and his brother took many years before, which was recounted in HDT’s first book with a very similar name. While I mainly enjoyed this essay, the comparison from then and now (being 2003), it doesn’t fit with the theme the other essays. The next essay didn’t fit well either, called Out in the Sort. It’s about a company that ships fresh lobster all around the world, the largest lobster company. Then it morphs into what UPS, United Parcel Service, can do for you. One could say a meandering essay, and perhaps covers shipping via airplane. Then we have Coal Train, which is about what it says, about shipping coal via train. This essay is the longest and by far could have been cut in half. It went on for too many pages, with too many details, that maybe a train buff, train spotter, what-have you would enjoy, or not. Then the last I’ve already mentioned. This book has not put me off of McPhee’s writing, but it may be a while before I jump into another collection of his essays."

This book is basically a series of essays about what it takes to move America's goods. It's a fascinating look at the skills and experience it takes to operate massive vehicles and vessels like these. The language can be rough, and the cigarette smoke can be thick, but you learn a lot about what it takes to do these jobs. They are often dangerous with little room for error. Until recently we sort of took our supply chain for granted. No more. Now you can read about how the supply chain operated before all hell broke loose three years ago. McPhee recreates the feeling of being in the cabin with these guys, as he uses their slang often without explaining what it means – you pick it up in context.

Here's my review on the towboat going down the Illinois section of McPhee's book: The Illinois River is third in freight carried, following the Mississippi and the Ohio. It's a relatively straight river except for some \"corkscrew\" bends near Pekin. The barges that navigate the Illinois can be huge. The Billy Joe Boling that McPhee is riding (some people get all the fun) is pushing a toe longer than the new Queen Mary 2, the longest ocean liner ever built. Maneuvering such a \"vessel\" takes skill and sang-froid. At its widest point, this collection of barges and towboat is four times longer than the river's 300 foot width. The Illinois is an autocthonous river (a word I learned from Founding Fish but will probably forget) beginning not far from Chicago. This particular barge string has fifteen barges wired together carrying pig iron, steel and fertilizer. The ones with pig iron appear empty, but the iron is so heavy and the river channel only nine feet deep at its minimum, that the barges can only be loaded to about 10 per cent of capacity. The steel cable holding the barges together is about an inch thick and the deck hands need to constantly monitor the tension of the wire.. The barges and tug at the stern become almost a rigid unit. The pilot has to steer this mass carefully between railroad bridge pilings and other obstructions. The pilot \"is steering the Queen Mary up an undersized river and he is luxuriating in six feet of clearnace.\" Meanwhile at the stern, behind the stern rail of the towboat, only ten feet away, is the riverbank. This assumes no unusual current changes. On the Mississippi, a tow can consists of as many as forty-nine barges and be two hundred and fifty feet wide. When they arrive at the Illinois, the consist needs to be broken up into smaller groups. Just by way of comparison, a fifteen barge tow can carry as much as 870 eighteen wheelers on the highway. All captains have to start as deckhands, and it's not unstressful. One physician who had been asked to study how pilots and captains handled stress, had to leave the boat because he couldn't handle the stress. The river is rarely empty and you can count on being approached by another thousand-foot tow coming at you down the river. Downstream tows always have the right of way. Hold spots, where a tow can be headed into the bank to wait for a downstream tow to pass, are plotted ahead of time and serve like railroad sidings. There is no dispatcher and the captains call traffic themselves announcing their location. A large tow will burn about one gallon each two hundred feet or twenty-four hundred gallons of diesel fuel per day. Measured by fuel consumed per ton-mile, barges are \"two and a half times more efficient than a freight train, nearly nine times more efficient than a truck.\" There aren't too many locks on the Illinois as the river drops only about ninety feet, but watching a tow go through one can provide hours of entertainment. I remember sitting at the lock across from Starved Rock State Park as a long tow broke into two sections to get through the lock. Unfortunately, pleasure boat operators being \"ignorant, ignorant, ignorant,\" accidents happen. Much like train engineers, towboat captains fear boaters who won't get out of the way. It's impossible to steer around a small boat and the prop wash and propeller suction can be lethal to the unwary. and the section on trains: Driving a train would seem simple enough: you push the lever forward and off you go. Not so. Coal trains, of which just one power plant in Georgia requires 3 fully loaded trains per day to keep running, are usually more than one and one-half miles long and weigh 34,000 tons. They are by far the heaviest trains on the rails. The train is so long that the engine in front (these trains must have engines in front and back and often in the middle as well to adjust the strain on the couplers) will often be applying the brakes going down hill while the engines in back are pushing the cars still going up the other side of the rise. They can't go up hills, per se. A slop of even 1.5% makes the engines work hard. Twenty-three thousand coal trains leave the Powder River basin every year; that's thirty-four thousand miles of rolling coal in a never ending stream of coal for power plants. The Powder River basin coal generates less heat, i.e. fewer BTU's than eastern coal, but it has a much lower sulfur content so following stricter environmental regulations eastern mines have been dying while western ones are thriving. That's where the railroads come in. Plant Scherer in Georgia, a large power plant, usually has a one-million-ton pile of coal in reserve. To understand the revived interest in nuclear power, that pile generates the equivalent of one truckload of mined uranium. \"To get a million BTUs, fuel oil costs nine dollars (before recent price increases,) natural gas six dollars, coal one-dollar-eighty-five, and nuclear fifty cents.\" \"Plant Scherer burns the contents of thirteen hundred coal trains per year -- two thousand miles of coal cars, twelve million tons of the bedrock of Wyoming.\" The plant requires twelve thousand acres to store, process and burn the coal. Think about that the next time you turn the lights on."

        "text":"This book is a collection of mini-biographies of people in the transportation industry. The first, last, and by far most compelling tells the story of a long-haul trucker -- a driver that owns his own rig and tank, transporting various goods. There's something deeply satisfying about seeing a real expert at work: someone that not only knows how to do their job well, but truly and deeply knows how to handle any eventuality effortlessly. The truck driver in this book is unquestionably an expert of that variety. Unfortunately, the other stories aren't quite as interesting. A few of them are interesting enough -- although not up to the standard of the first one -- but the rest are sub-par. One is about Thoreau's travels with his brother, that the author replicates -- somewhat. It seems out of place, compared to the rest of the pieces, and it's not even that enjoyable to read. There's another piece on UPS, which should have been a highlight (goodness knows that there is a huge untapped mine of stories there) but was only so-so: some parts of that one are enjoyable to read, but those parts are more about UPS's anonymous subcontracting of, well, almost anything (laptop repair, order fulfillment, etc), and not about transportation. In the end, I really enjoyed this book. I just wish the author would have dropped about half of it, and either expanded the rest or found other high-quality segments to replace it."

He finds himself in an eighteen-wheel chemical tanker with hazmat materials inside, a towboat pushing a triple load of barges up the Illinois River and in the cabs of 150-car long coal trains traversing Nebraska and Wyoming. He also spends time inside a major hub for UPS with four million square feet of floor space at the Louisville Airport located between parallel runways just to see how zillions of packages are correctly routed into trucks and planes. Oh, and he follows the path of Henry David Thoreau & his brother John down the Concord and Merrimack Rivers in a sixteen-foot canoe. The craziest \"trip\" was at a lake in French Alps where--for $15,000 per week--captains of huge ocean going liners \"practice\" with twenty-foot scale models for any eventuality that might occur on the high seas. In the course of these travels, the author weaves a lot of local history into his travels along with a great deal of humor and insight. This book is a fascinating ride (pun intended) into worlds that the average American never visits."

    "desc":"While John McPhee was working on his previous book, Rising from the Plains , he happened to walk by the engineering building at the University of Wyoming, where words etched in limestone said: \"Strive on--the control of Nature is won, not given.\" In the morning sunlight, that central phrase--\"the control of nature\"--seemed to sparkle with unintended ambiguity. Bilateral, symmetrical, it could with equal speed travel in opposite directions. For some years, he had been planning a book about places in the world where people have been engaged in all-out battles with nature, about (in the words of the book itself) \"any struggle against natural forces--heroic or venal, rash or well advised--when human beings conscript themselves to fight against the earth, to take what is not given, to rout the destroying enemy, to surround the base of Mt. Olympus demanding and expecting the surrender of the gods.\" His interest had first been sparked when he went into the Atchafalaya--the largest river swamp in North America--and had learned that virtually all of its waters were metered and rationed by a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' project called Old River Control. In the natural cycles of the Mississippi's deltaic plain, the time had come for the Mississippi to change course, to shift its mouth more than a hundred miles and go down the Atchafalaya, one of its distributary branches. The United States could not afford that--for New Orleans, Baton Rouge, and all the industries that lie between would be cut off from river commerce with the rest of the nation. At a place called Old River, the Corps therefore had built a great fortress--part dam, part valve--to restrain the flow of the Atchafalaya and compel the Mississippi to stay where it is. In Iceland, in 1973, an island split open without warning and huge volumes of lava began moving in the direction of a harbor scarcely half a mile away. It was not only Iceland's premier fishing port (accounting for a large percentage of Iceland's export economy) but it was also the only harbor along the nation's southern coast. As the lava threatened to fill the harbor and wipe it out, a physicist named Thorbjorn Sigurgeirsson suggested a way to fight against the flowing red rock--initiating an all-out endeavor unique in human history. On the big island of Hawaii, one of the world's two must eruptive hot spots, people are not unmindful of the Icelandic example. McPhee went to Hawaii to talk with them and to walk beside the edges of a molten lake and incandescent rivers. Some of the more expensive real estate in Los Angeles is up against mountains that are rising and disintegrating as rapidly as any in the world. After a complex coincidence of natural events, boulders will flow out of these mountains like fish eggs, mixed with mud, sand, and smaller rocks in a cascading mass known as debris flow. Plucking up trees and cars, bursting through doors and windows, filling up houses to their eaves, debris flows threaten the lives of people living in and near Los Angeles' famous canyons. At extraordinary expense the city has built a hundred and fifty stadium-like basins in a daring effort to catch the debris. Taking us deep into these contested territories, McPhee details the strategies and tactics through which people attempt to control nature. Most striking in his vivid depiction of the main contestants: nature in complex and awesome guises, and those who would attempt to wrest control from her--stubborn, often ingenious, and always arresting characters.",

        "text":"There are three extended essays herein about disparate places where humans insist on settling, sometimes - oftentimes - just for the view; but the land has a different idea. Man and his abode face disaster in these stories. Man could move, of course; and some do. But others try to control nature. As if. One real river pilot - meaning not Mark Twain - is quoted here: Mother Nature is patient. . . . Mother Nature has more time than we do. I knew, of course, that the Mississippi floods, that volcanoes bubble, and that Los Angeles has random fires and mudslides. Yet I didn't know the science of it. As he always does, John McPhee here blends history, science, biography, anecdote and the occasional personal intrusion to explain it all. Man versus Nature. Who will win? Atchafalaya People settled in New Orleans and Baton Rouge. They became thriving cities and important ports well before it became apparent there was a problem. The Atchafalaya (rhymes with jambalaya) runs roughly parallel to the Mississippi. It just lies there quiet and smooth. It lies there like a big alligator in a low slough, with time on its side, waiting--waiting to outwit the Corps of Engineers--and hunkering down ever lower in its bed and presenting a sort of maw to the Mississippi, into which the river could fall. It is the Atchafalaya's raison d'être to capture the Mississippi. And it would, maybe already would have, if Nature was allowed to run its course. The Mississippi \"is just itching to go that way,\" Congress was told in 1928. And if it did, well, New Orleans and Baton Rouge would be underwater and the Saints would be playing home football games about 150 miles to the west. So they built levees, and then ever higher and higher levees. But the Atchafalaya is not going away, nor is its seeming purpose. Stay tuned. One of the reasons I read McPhee is for his humor, which can sneak up on you. In referencing The War of 1812, McPhee begins a sentence: When that unusual year was in its thirty-sixth month . . . Cooling the Lava I said above that sometimes people settle in a place for the view and you can see why folks are reluctant to leave Vestmannaeyjar, a town and archipelago off the south coast of Iceland: Until, of course, this happens: Iceland, I learned, is volcanic, a hot spot. Or, as McPhee writes: Iceland is the geologic chocolate shop of this minor planet. But there's that view. So some people left, but others came back. A lot of this section is about how Iceland tries to control the lava flow, shooting streams of water at it that works, sort of. It worked well enough that other countries brought the Icelanders in to see if they could help. They couldn't help in Hawaii. There McPhee went, took the obligatory visits to Mauna Kea and Mauna Loa. Then he went to Kilauea and, after appropriate waivers, climbed to the top. McPhee wrote: Kilauea since 1983 has not been quiet for fifteen minutes. I read the section on Kilauea, paused for a sip of red wine since it was handy, and heard my cellphone buzz with an alert: Kilauea had just erupted. My reading life gets spookier and spookier. Anyhow, I also read McPhee because he just writes with a wide-angle lens. Speaking of Mauna Loa: The long mountain is fifty miles long. Viewed from the edge of the ocean, it is an astonishing trompe-l'oeil, because it is so smoothly constructed that it appears in two dimensions and presents a deceptive depth of field. It looks like a low friendly hill, a singing dune, at worst a bald Scottish brae. You think, I'll run up there and have a look around before lunch. The long mountain is as high as the Alps. If it were dissected by streams--given promontories and reentrants, serrated by canyons, invaded by shadows--it might look something like the Alps. As is, it's just a massive shield, composed of chilled magma, looking the way the Alps would look if a dentist could repair them. Los Angeles Against the Mountains Fires and mudslides in Los Angeles are widely reported on (Oprah's house being front page news), but I never knew the particulars of why they happened. It turns out there are many factors, not excluding human foible. Los Angeles sprawls. On one side is the Pacific Ocean, and on the other side is the San Gabriel Mountains. On these particular mountains is chaparral which will burn in large swaths. Humans are often the culprit. But when chaparral is consumed by fire it makes the ground essentially waterproof. Then it's a matter of waiting for the winter rains. Boulders come loose, join with mud, and trees and cars and parts of buildings in the way. It's not just the water. It's massive debris, filling swimming pools, garages and houses, and really spoiling the view. This is a story of debris basins and other human attempts to stop the mountains. Because the people won't move. There's the view, and the celebrities, the money, and sometimes the seeming privacy. As one resident said, \"If it gets where I can't pee off my front porch, I'll move.\" Oh, and another reason I read McPhee is that he will not say smog . No. Instead he writes this: The ascending effluents of the smelters, refineries, mills, and factories added a great burden to the marine fog layer--made heavier still as the work force moved about in cars. To describe this ochre cumulus, the world's shortest portmanteau word, which had been coined around 1905, was borrowed from London."

        "text":"If you asked me a week ago, or before I read this book, if I thought this would be a five star book I would have thought you were crazy. Her? This book? I would have probably told you I might never even read this book and that it made me bored to just read the copy on the back. And I can't even tell you why I started to read this. I was just sitting around my apartment, reading Ladies and Gentlemen, The Bible! , and I had about thirty pages left and I got restless and it was still light out, actually it was about 7 pm, and it's summer so that meant I still had an hour or so of light, and it was nicer outside than it was in my stuffy apartment so I decided to go outside and read, but I got afraid that I'd zip through the not-so-hilarious re-tellings of bible stories and after standing in the middle of my apartment looking in every direction trying to figure out which book to read next, I just grabbed this one, I don't know why, partly because it was on one of my little cardboard shelves and it was easy to see from where I was standing and I thought I'm not going to care too much about this, I'll be able to give it away when I'm done! And it's only 272 pages long, with sort of big print! Let's go read  about the control of nature. But I was so young and foolish and stupid then, a week ago, last Sunday. This book is so good! I can't do any justice to the book by trying to explain what it is about. If you goto this edition of the book you can read a fairly good description of what the book is about: here ! The easy response to just about any of the three stories that make up the basis for these essays (Man Versus The Mississippi River and it's natural inclination to 'move' to a more efficient route to the Gulf of Mexico and it's propensity to flood places like New Orleans, which is just asking for it; Man Versus slow moving lava and mountain (a fucking mountain, a moving fucking mountain on lava. And not an existing mountain, but a new mountain that didn't already exist, how awesome \/ twisted \/ mind bending is that? A big fissure opens in the ground, lava starts seeping out, big fire shit shoots into the sky some other geological stuff happens and from the side of a mountain comes another mountain that is moving and some guys with water pumps are trying to stop it) that are threatening to destroy a harbor on an Icelandic Island; and Man Versus millions of tons of rocks and boulders that come sliding off of mountains on the edge of Los Angeles when the conditions are right and destroy everything in their path), as I was saying, the easy response to these is 'well that's what you get for building \/ living there. But of course, like just about everything in life, when you start to find out more about the situation the easy response isn't so easy. Yeah, people don't need to have million dollar homes on the edge of mountains just waiting for the right combination of wildfire debris, big rains and loose ground from the very active mountains that are still in the process of rising to send rock slides, which can easily pull an automobile along with it, heading towards the expensive homes (and then these people, have the gall to try to sue for property damage they suffer, and sometimes apparently they even win (but sometimes rationality prevails and they don't and they are told, well you knew the risks)), but what do you do now that they are living there? And that they are living there and they are quite possibly extremely litigious? And then what do you think of the situation when you find out it's not just rich idiots living in those homes, but also pretty much the entire geology department of Cal Tech lives in this danger zone, the people who study what is going on here, and who know all of the dangers better than probably anyone else in the world, and they chose to live there. Can you imagine how great the area must be to knowingly risk having your home wiped out in seconds by raging rocks? My favorite part of the book was the Volcano essay that made up the center of the book. It was just amazing, and it didn't even need to rely on some of the silliness that Americans provide with their 'I'm going to sue you!' mentality that the very excellent \"Los Angeles Against the Mountains\" essay had going on it (it was very very good besides some of the silly stories). I don't know who is reading this right now, but you should read this essay, it's called \"Cooling the Lava\" and I can't put into words how great I thought it was. I'm sort of a bit in love with volcanos after reading it. I'll even cut this review short so that you can go find a copy of this book, or the essay and read it, and hopefully you wont think I steered you too wrong. The rest of this review would have just been gushing about how much I loved the book, or me saying something like \"why are people in Los Angeles so dumb?!?\", now go away and read the essay."

To mitigate against this, the Army Corps of Engineers has built several huge water exchangers that connect the two rivers under the theory that regulating the flow of Mississippi water into the Atchafalaya may forestall grand theft by the latter. As always, McPhee interviews just the right officials and employees at just the right time, and his descriptive similes are jewels: the spillway that transmits Mississippi water into the Atchafalaya goes \"sideways, like grain squirting out of a burlap bag.\" What do you do when red-hot lava from new or recent volcanoes threatens the nearest towns and cities? In Iceland, you pump literally millions of gallons of cold seawater on the magma, hoping it will stall into solid basalt and (eventually) stop the flow. In Hawaii, you try channelling, playing a dangerous game of curling to make the killer lava go somewhere slightly different than it had intended. This section is called \"Cooling the Lava\" and it is absolutely enthralling, as are the rugged academics, military folk and plain old citizens McPhee encounters in both places. The third section shows the full power of civilization, bureaucracy and high technology against the San Gabriel Mountains -- in other words \"Los Angeles Against the Mountains\" -- and in spite of millions upon millions spent for retaining walls, dry reservoirs to catch rain-loosed mud and dislodged bolders, it remains to be seen who will eventually win. Why, oh why, do people insist on nesting just below these flaky mountains? One reason is to get above the smog zone, making it something that can be seen but not breathed: Recalling that Southern California smog has its origin in natural sea fog: As you watch it from above through the morning and into the afternoon, it turns yellow, then ochre, then brown, and sometimes nearly black -- like butter darkening in a skillet. Verbally, McPhee is also no stranger to humor; lest I introduce spoilers I won't detail the jibes he gets off at one suburban Arby's, but watch out for them! All three segments, and therefore all of The Control of Nature , come highly recommended. The actual circumstances may have changed since McPhee first wrote his articles that became this can't-put-down book; the author's richly compelling way with words hasn't."

I liked the book more than he did, and found McPhee's portrayals of the geologists & engineers accurate and sympathetic. These aren't colorful personalities, as a rule. (Definite exceptions for some!) But I'm a McPhee fanboy, so YMMV. But his description of the Atchafalaya River \"Control\" structure vibrating and humming in a flood, seemingly on the verge of failure.... Well, all these years later, it's still doing its job: https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Old_Riv...

        "text":"McFee looks at three huge public works project, the damning and redirectioning of the Mississippi via ongoing construction, primarily by the Army Corps of Engineers; attempts in Iceland to redirect the flow of large volumes of lava away from a town by spraying massive amounts of water at the flow edges; and coping with massive debris flows in Los Angeles, as the San Gabriel mountains that abut the city both rise and crumble. Information here includes some history of the US Army Corps of Engineers, an enlightening look at the history of flooding in New Orleans, an appreciation for the significance of the Atchafalaya, and a look at the geology and natural processes in effect in Los Angeles.Overall, the information presented in The Control of Nature is very interesting. Considering that it was published in 1989, and that I was unaware of the specifics involved, it has clearly not become common knowledge, and thus retains a bit of freshness. It might be nice to see a follow-up by the author, particularly as applied to the Mississippi and Los Angeles issues, in light of events since publication. I confess that I did not look for such, and it may well be out there. While the information in the book was interesting, it seemed to me that the writing was less so. McPhee offers a host of local personalities to illustrate the impact of these issues on people, and generically that approach is sound. Yet, the impact of that approach was minimal. I never felt that his portrayals went beyond what one might find in newspaper reportage of the day. One need not make characters come alive as a good novelist might, but his portrayals rarely rose above the mundane. I thought the book would have profited from the inclusion of illustrations. There is a brief section in which drawings are shown of structures no longer present in Iceland, but they added little."

        "text":"From time to time all hell will break forth from the mountains. To the question “Why, then, do people live there?” the answer seems to be that... they would rather defy nature than live without it. This is a very interesting book that looks at three different locations where people have tried to “control nature” and live where history and perhaps common sense says they probably shouldn't: — The Mississippi River has an enormous flood plain. People have been building levees for at least a couple of centuries, but that has the unintended effect of just sending more water to those who live further downriver. The Army Corps of Engineers built and maintains a river control structure that particularly protects those living in the Atchafalaya and New Orleans area, and keeps the end of the river from moving to another place. Atchafalaya. The word will now come to mind more or less in echo of any struggle against natural forces—heroic or venal, rash or well advised—when human beings conscript themselves to fight against the earth, to take what is not given, to rout the destroying enemy, to surround the base of Mt. Olympus demanding and expecting the surrender of the gods... I put [a green-and-white sticker that said “ATCHAFALAYA”] in a window of my car. It has been there for many years, causing drivers on the New Jersey Turnpike to veer in close and crowd my lane while staring at a word that signifies collision. — When the ground split open and started spewing red-hot lava into the sky above Heimaey, the largest island of Vestmannaeyjar in Iceland, some were more worried about protecting the harbor than the homes. When the lava flow started getting close, they began spraying water on it in an attempt to halt it in its tracks. But the lava had to go somewhere. Even in something as primal as a volcanic eruption, the component of human interference could apparently enter the narrative and, in complex and unpredictable geometries, alter the shape of succeeding events. After the human contribution passed a level higher than trifling, the evolution of the new landscape could in no pure sense be natural. The event had lost its status as a simple act of God. In making war with nature, there was risk of loss in winning. — The San Gabriel Mountains on the east side of Los Angeles are some of the steepest in the world due to plate tectonics. But in addition to earthquakes, the residents have to deal with fires and floods. And not just floods of water, but debris flows full of boulders, some larger than cars. “It’s a fantastic place to be in a storm. You hear a sound like giant castanets—boulders clicking together. They’re not pebbles. And there is a scent, which is absolutely heavenly, of the crushed chaparral plants. It’s so fragrant and beautiful it’s eerie to have it associated with something so terrifying. And, God knows, it is terrifying.” Although the book is a bit dated (first published in 1989), it's still a very interesting read. John McPhee has a clever way with words and it's kind of a pleasure to read, but he's also rather long-winded and frequently sarcastic. He often seems to disparage people for living in such places, even using the word \"dingbats\" in a couple of odd places. But he also seems to recognize the beauty of these locations. Overall, the book was an enjoyable read and fascinating to consider the power of nature, especially in the face of our hubris to try to modify and control it. However, throughout the book, I couldn't help but think of a quote from Werner Heisenberg, one of the founders of quantum theory, who reminds us that we are part of nature, too: “In classical physics, science started from the belief—or should one say, from the illusion?—that we could describe the world, or at least parts of the world, without any reference to ourselves.”"

I always gave McPhee credit for being able to make a wallpaper seminar given in northern England sound like the high point of a trip to Europe, but in The Control of Nature , a book about things decidedly more interesting than wallpaper, I found my mind kept wandering. It may not have helped that for two out of his three subjects, I have peripheral experience: in Atchafalaya , McPhee describes the efforts by the Army Corps of Engineers to keep the Mississippi River contained within its traditional courses, and in Los Angeles Against the Mountains . the efforts of the L.A. County Flood Control District to keep the San Gabriel Mountains from squashing Los Angeles into a molehill. I don't know whether working on the Mississippi River (currently) or living near Los Angeles (about the time McPhee was writing this) should have made me more interested or less, but the truth is I found it hard to pay attention. That I had nothing at all similar to the experiences related in Cooling the Lava , where Icelanders saved their town by spraying water on a lava flow that threatened their town, didn't seem to make much difference though--I still had a hard time maintaining interest. I can't think of any good reason this should be so--McPhee is a good writer. Not too clever, slyly humorous on occasion but not to the point of overdoing it, informative and exhaustive; I can't point to anything that's wrong here. So I'm going to chalk it up to wrong book at the wrong time. That I found his book Looking for a Ship fascinating tells me that I'll still give McPhee plenty of other chances."

        "text":"John McPhee is an inspired observer, outdoorsman and a writer with ultimate mastery of the English language. This is an extract from the jacket. \"The Control of Nature is John McPhee's bestselling account of places in the world where people have been engaged in all-out battles with nature. In Louisiana, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has declared war on the lower Mississippi River, which threatens to follow a new route to the sea and cut off New Orleans and Baton Rouge from the rest of the United States. Icelanders confront flowing red lava in an attempt to save a crucial harbor. In Los Angeles, basins are built to catch devastating debris flows from the San Gabriel Mountains. Taking us deep into these contested territories, McPhee details the strategies and tactics through which people attempt to control nature. Most striking is his depiction of the main contestants: nature in complex and awesome guises, and those attempting to wrest control from her stubborn, sometimes foolhardy, more often ingenious, and always arresting characters.\" John's books frequently appear serialized in the New Yorker. Over the years I've read all of his 29 books. Many of his books like 'Basin to Range' are slow, many would consider them dull\" because they're primarily about geology. But individually and collectively they're my favorite books and I reread them on a regular basis. They're intensely interesting: 'Coming into the Country' is a collection of stories about the people of Alaska (way pre Sarah Palin), Informative to a fault: 'Oranges' and wonderfully absorbing, his newest, 'Uncommon Carriers'. 'Uncommon Carriers': Again an overview: \"Over the past eight years, John McPhee has spent considerable time in the company of people who work in freight transportation. Uncommon Carriers is his sketchbook of them and of his journeys with them. He rides from Atlanta to Tacoma alongside Don Ainsworth, owner and operator of a sixty-five-foot, eighteen-wheel chemical tanker carrying hazmats. McPhee attends ship-handling school on a pond in the foothills of the French Alps, where, for a tuition of $15,000 a week, skippers of the largest ocean ships refine their capabilities in twenty-foot scale models. He goes up the “tight-assed” Illinois River on a “towboat” pushing a triple string of barges, the overall vessel being “a good deal longer than the Titanic.” And he travels by canoe up the canal-and-lock commercial waterways traveled by Henry David Thoreau and his brother, John, in a homemade skiff in 1839. Uncommon Carriers is classic work by McPhee, in prose distinguished, as always, by its author’s warm humor, keen insight, and rich sense of human character.\" I enjoyed this book so much that I tried to read just a few pages a day to make it last, reading other books the rest of the time His little book, 'the making of a bark canoe' is classic McPhee. Full of painstaking detail about one young man's obsession with making authentic bark canoes, with simple tools, and canoeing trips with him to test them. John McPhee is an avid outdoorsman. It permeates his books. His books grown on one, become old friends and companions in life. A calm accurate, enthralling and literate observer of the worlds he discovers for the rest of us. Perhaps the best counter to too much fast and electronic information that I know of in out interactive, online, plugged in world, which I love also."

It would be funny if it was fiction. A sheriff survives the inundation of his neighborhood by a massive debris slug only because it tosses him into the back of a pickup truck being carried along in the mud and boulders along with parts of houses. The absurdity of many of the eco-meets-ego situations reaches the Carl Hiaasen level, except these stories don’t take place in Florida. And they are real. Written in 1989, Control of Nature analyzes the economic, social and geological forces behind three man-vs.-nature struggles: the attempt to force the Mississippi River to behave in the way that permanently settled human communities want it to, and not to change course when it naturally would have done so; the fight to cool a lava flow in Iceland and save a fishing harbor; and the most absurd of all somehow, Los Angeles Against the Mountains, the persistence of people living in the eroding and also rising San Gabriels, where the combination of tectonic forces lifting the mountains and erosion and fire on their slopes leads to a constant flow of rocks toward LA. Big ones. Tons of them. The most depressing section was about the Mississippi. Hurricane Katrina made it all too clear how vulnerable people are when they live in places where only many man-made interventions have enabled them to be there—where it would be an entirely different ecosystem and landscape if left alone. As we know from the story of post-Katrina New Orleans, some people go back, though lot of people didn’t. On the island in Iceland where the volcano erupted, a lot of people didn’t go back, either, but many did. McPhee does a good job of getting the points of view of the people who choose the risk. Some people have no choice—they were born in a threatened place and don’t have the means to move, but others build or buy expensive homes on the slopes of unstable mountains. He finds experts on the geology of the San Gabriels who consciously live right in the path of potential debris flows, as well as real estate agents who blithely talk their way around the risk, reassuring potential buyers more than they ought to be reassured. McPhee’s interest in the human beings involved as well as the earth makes him a great story-teller. A little distractible, a little inclined to collect as many anecdotes as possible, but never dull. He can make alarming and complex scientific material readable without making it any less alarming. The issues are not old. I did a little research before writing this review. People studying the Old River Control structure where the Atchafalaya is being—for now—prevented from capturing the Mississippi still say McPhee’s article that was the basis for this book is the best thing ever written on the topic. Debris flows are still endangering California towns. People still live where nature could cover them up with water, lava or rocks on short notice, and they love those places or need them economically. Taxes pay for the structures that make it possible for them to be there, and for the recovery when disaster strikes. Decide what you think about that, after you read this book."

So sayeth author John McPhee in his three-part reportage of man's attempts to control, divert or redirect nature's plans. His travels take him to the Mississippi Delta, where engineers have manufactured an artificial flood control to maintain the Ole Man in its present course rather than what the river wants to do: take over the neighboring Atchafalaya channel, thereby forever bypassing the river commerce hubs of Baton Rogue and New Orleans. It should come as no surprise--especially given the failure of the levees during Hurricane Katrina--that the attempt has been...less than all-successful. Written in 1989, this story especially resonates with what came only 16 years later for the Delta...and WILL come again. Then McPhee travels to Iceland, where an erupting volcano's lava flow threatens to fill in an important fishing harbor, following the brave (or vain) fight by the Icelanders to cool the lava flow before it completely destroys the economic center of their country. And lastly, to my adopted town Los Angeles, where the San Gabriel Mountains continue to crumble as plate tectonics push them up vertiginously and unstably, causing \"debris flows\" for those brave\/foolish\/enterprising folks who build homes in the canyons--and right in the firing line of the mudslides. This is a fascinating, humbling and frequently amusing read, almost classically Greek in its depictions of humankind's Sisyphusian efforts to circumvent God and Nature's plans and the inevitable disasters that follow. I live in Pasadena, at the very foot of the San Gabriels, right in the line of fire. And perhaps it is Providential that in a few short days I will travel to New Orleans...perhaps more keenly aware, as I sleep (and drink) of the dammed (and damned) river ready to swallow, at some indeterminate date, the neo-French settlement once and for all.

I’ve liked everything McPhee writes even if I knew nothing of the subject and had never considered it interesting enough to get informed. This books is three essays on human attempts to control nature, not just for the fun of it but to solve a problem where nature caused humans difficulty mainly because it disrupted they way humans were already interacting with nature. In the Mississippi example, the river wanted a new outlet to the Gulf and would have found it in the Atchafalaya River, a faster route because of the gradient and because it was the shortest route. It was predicted to happen naturally by 1991. But if it had, the cities of New Orleans and Baton Rouge, to say nothing of the industry which had been built up around them would have been cut off. And the Atchafalaya Swamp country (Cajun country) would also be changed. So the Corps of Engineers, beginning in the Sixties built a flood control structure that was designed to send no more than 30% of the water down the Atchafalaya while the rest was directed down the “old route”. On an Icelandic island which was essentially a fishing community, a new volcano sprouted and seemed about not only to engulf the town but to destroy the harbor, a harbor from which fisherman caught a major portion of Iceland's main export, fish. Eventually they tried using water from high powered hoses to cool the lava flow and direct it away from the harbor. Much of the town was inundated, but the harbor was saved, even though it ended up with a new volcano on its edge. In Los Angeles, people began to move to the hills in front of the San Gabriel Mountains and the more the hillsides were built up and the more people moved to the hills, the more disastrous floods and debris runs caused death and destruction. The cause was pretty complex. The chaparral would burn and become water proof. Then when winter rainstorms came, the water would not soak into the ground but cause floods and debris runs. Whole trees and huge boulders would rush down the mountain taking with it anything in the path: whole automobiles and other large objects from the highest homes and picking up more as it went. The solution was debris fans which channeled the debris to pickup points from which the city hauled it away, millions of tons.... these debris fans were pretty successful but there was no dissuading people from buying or building in the hills, higher and higher into the hills. Because these debris runs occurred infrequently and residents for the most part didn’t understand the conditions that made them possible, the danger was not taken seriously enough. Fascinating book. Published in 1989. We still hear of these awful floods and debris runs in LA, though I never realized there was more to it than floods. The Mississippi has not deserted New Orleans though the ecological problems there make one wonder. Vestmannseyjar has not been overcome with lava and evidently Hawaii has learned some from their example. I’d love to have a 2019 update on these projects."

        "text":"Ironically named book that recounts three episodes where humans have tried to resist the mighty forces of nature: 1. It's a natural phenomenon for a river to change course. Natural or man-made obstructions come and go, but the water still has to get from here to there. About every 1000 years, the mouth (outlet) of the Mississippi River changes course. Silt builds up and begins to slow the flow into the Gulf. A slower flow deposits more sediment, and the process accelerates. Eventually, the water finds a steeper path to the gulf, and the river's course changes. Around 1950, scientists realized that the Mississippi was getting ready to relocate a few hundred miles west. That would have left New Orleans without a port or drinking water. Ditto Baton Rouge. The Army Corps of Engineers was directed to make sure that didn't happen. They have succeeded (for now) but with an unending comedy of fixes to fixes to fixes. For example, they might build a three foot levy to prevent flooding. But the former flood plain, denied water and sediment, subsides. So the levy now has to be six feet or nine feet to keep the river in its banks. That it does, but... unintended consequences follow. 2. A volcano in Iceland erupted. The lava flow threatened to fill in Iceland's only southern port. Civil defense authorities fought the lava flow by pouring millions of gallons of water on the leading edge of the lava. The idea was to cool it enough to harden and form a dam, stopping the lava from overflowing the port. Did it work? Well, there's still a port there. But the town got wiped out by the redirected lava. 3. The San Gabriel mountains in southern California are having a growth spurt. They are thrusting up at a lightning pace, at least in geologic terms. Boulders become exposed to the elements and gravity. Periodic wild fires turn the mountainsides into playground slides. When a heavy rain comes, debris flows (like wet cement spiced with Volkswagen-sized boulders) slide down the hills and invite themselves into the homes at the bottom of the mountains. Engineers design basins and drainage canals to catch the debris flows, but they need to be emptied continuously, and where do you put this stuff? The author has a dry sense of humor and resists the urge to be snarky. His point is clear: If it's human ingenuity against nature, put your money on nature."

This is a fun book to read if only to get a sense of what huge projects people will embark on to protect their way of life. It's a shame that the projects are ultimately useless because the scale that nature operates on simply dwarfs what civil engineering can handle.

I thought I was pretty well aware of what's going on nationally, but some things just slip past. The story about the islands off the coast of Iceland was also nice, McPhee gave a good description of the mentality of Icelanders. Collectively, I think the three stories paint a diverse picture of peoples' attempts to \"improve\" their surroundings for material gain, but they're lacking something. As I read this book, it became very evident that they have been published serially (in the New Yorker) and the three sections of the book were not really tied together in any direct way (besides the obvious thematic connection). It just struck me as a somewhat lazy thing to do after putting together all the research on each of the individual bits. That aspect doesn't take away from the purpose of the book, but it's a missed opportunity to add more analysis for readers who have missed the original publications. Speaking of analysis, if you're looking for a strong opinion on the various projects that are discussed, you'll have to look somewhere beyond this book. This is not exactly a detraction: McPhee provided a fair amount of evidence to describe each of the projects and the effect on the relevant communities. You can make up your own mind on the value of the engineering efforts, and will have a good starting point if you'd like to go deeper in any of these areas. That said, simply by writing these books McPhee expressed his own opinion on the apparent follies awaiting nature to take its course. As you may have gathered by now, this review has purposefully skirted the actual contents of the book. This is not because there's nothing to discuss, but rather the story is better told by McPhee than me. It's an entertaining book that delivers exactly what I expected from the title and cover. Could it have done more? Sure. Was it worth going through? I think so."

        "text":"Despite the rave reviews, I find this book a little hard to love. This is a collection of three journalistic pieces, covering the stories of how the US Army Corp of Engineers sought to keep the Mississippi river from diverting into another branch and cutting off New Orleans, how Icelandic government stopped a branch of a lava flow from blocking up a harbor, and how the Californian government tried to minimize damages from the unpredictable debris flow coming down from the crumbling San Gabriel mountains. While the topic of the stories are intriguing, and the author did a great job describing all the facets of these complex stories, I found the approach a little \"too broad.\" Sometimes, I get confused by the recurrent episodes of disasters that happened every decade or so, not sure whether I'm reading about an episode that occurred in 1972, or 1913, or 1951. Sometimes, I doubt if it was necessary for me to know the opinion of one particular geology professor, after already hearing the opinion of several others in a row. In the end, I do find it a remarkable feat of journalism to give such a comprehensive coverage to these stories and demonstrate the absurdity and ingenuity of the engineers at the same time. Every time I have a question in my mind, e.g. if they collected all the debris in these dams, what do they do with them? The author already followed up with a segment answering those question, e.g. they broke it down and used it on the beaches or they engineered storms to wash them away. It is a great book for seeing how versatile the New Yorker style of reporting (and writing) can be, how it can effectively tell stories from local cultural events to large, earth-changing cataclysms, while still touching the readers' hearts. But at the same time, for readers who have no specific interst in the topic, this may be just all a little bit too much to digest."

        "text":"McPhee is dazzling here, with three detailed articles on mankind's most audacious attempts at fighting the titanic forces of nature. McPhee mixes big-picture exposition with archive material and quotes from personal, on-site interviews, always lively and often playful. Through it all he combines a stunned amazement that we dare even attempt this with some serious respect for the people that do it. Takeaways: 1. Southern Louisiana is actually constitutionally opposed to permanent, earthbound human settlements. The continued existence of New Orleans and Morgan City can be largely attributed to the bloodyminded struggle of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which has been wrestling with the Mississippi River for decades in an effort to prevent it from going where it will, eventually, go. 2. The people of Iceland went to war with a volcano and, acting as foot soldiers for the sea, won. 3. By any traditional reckoning, Los Angeles has clearly been condemned by several deities. I knew wildfires were an issue there, but I didn't realise that a lot of the explosively flammable brush actually renders the ground below a shallow layer hydrophobic, contributing to massive debris flows that attempt to sweep away or at least bury most of the city (which also sits on top of a massive tectonic faultline). You could feel McPhee's jaw dropping as he spoke to people who brushed off the suggestion that their house could quite probably be washed away by gigantic debris swells."

        "text":"There are three extended essays herein about disparate places where humans insist on settling, sometimes - oftentimes - just for the view; but the land has a different idea. Man and his abode face disaster in these stories. Man could move, of course; and some do. But others try to control nature. As if. One real river pilot - meaning not Mark Twain - is quoted here: Mother Nature is patient. . . . Mother Nature has more time than we do. I knew, of course, that the Mississippi floods, that volcanoes bubble, and that Los Angeles has random fires and mudslides. Yet I didn't know the science of it. As he always does, John McPhee here blends history, science, biography, anecdote and the occasional personal intrusion to explain it all. Man versus Nature. Who will win? Atchafalaya People settled in New Orleans and Baton Rouge. They became thriving cities and important ports well before it became apparent there was a problem. The Atchafalaya (rhymes with jambalaya) runs roughly parallel to the Mississippi. It just lies there quiet and smooth. It lies there like a big alligator in a low slough, with time on its side, waiting--waiting to outwit the Corps of Engineers--and hunkering down ever lower in its bed and presenting a sort of maw to the Mississippi, into which the river could fall. It is the Atchafalaya's raison d'être to capture the Mississippi. And it would, maybe already would have, if Nature was allowed to run its course. The Mississippi \"is just itching to go that way,\" Congress was told in 1928. And if it did, well, New Orleans and Baton Rouge would be underwater and the Saints would be playing home football games about 150 miles to the west. So they built levees, and then ever higher and higher levees. But the Atchafalaya is not going away, nor is its seeming purpose. Stay tuned. One of the reasons I read McPhee is for his humor, which can sneak up on you. In referencing The War of 1812, McPhee begins a sentence: When that unusual year was in its thirty-sixth month . . . Cooling the Lava I said above that sometimes people settle in a place for the view and you can see why folks are reluctant to leave Vestmannaeyjar, a town and archipelago off the south coast of Iceland: Until, of course, this happens: Iceland, I learned, is volcanic, a hot spot. Or, as McPhee writes: Iceland is the geologic chocolate shop of this minor planet. But there's that view. So some people left, but others came back. A lot of this section is about how Iceland tries to control the lava flow, shooting streams of water at it that works, sort of. It worked well enough that other countries brought the Icelanders in to see if they could help. They couldn't help in Hawaii. There McPhee went, took the obligatory visits to Mauna Kea and Mauna Loa. Then he went to Kilauea and, after appropriate waivers, climbed to the top. McPhee wrote: Kilauea since 1983 has not been quiet for fifteen minutes. I read the section on Kilauea, paused for a sip of red wine since it was handy, and heard my cellphone buzz with an alert: Kilauea had just erupted. My reading life gets spookier and spookier. Anyhow, I also read McPhee because he just writes with a wide-angle lens. Speaking of Mauna Loa: The long mountain is fifty miles long. Viewed from the edge of the ocean, it is an astonishing trompe-l'oeil, because it is so smoothly constructed that it appears in two dimensions and presents a deceptive depth of field. It looks like a low friendly hill, a singing dune, at worst a bald Scottish brae. You think, I'll run up there and have a look around before lunch. The long mountain is as high as the Alps. If it were dissected by streams--given promontories and reentrants, serrated by canyons, invaded by shadows--it might look something like the Alps. As is, it's just a massive shield, composed of chilled magma, looking the way the Alps would look if a dentist could repair them. Los Angeles Against the Mountains Fires and mudslides in Los Angeles are widely reported on (Oprah's house being front page news), but I never knew the particulars of why they happened. It turns out there are many factors, not excluding human foible. Los Angeles sprawls. On one side is the Pacific Ocean, and on the other side is the San Gabriel Mountains. On these particular mountains is chaparral which will burn in large swaths. Humans are often the culprit. But when chaparral is consumed by fire it makes the ground essentially waterproof. Then it's a matter of waiting for the winter rains. Boulders come loose, join with mud, and trees and cars and parts of buildings in the way. It's not just the water. It's massive debris, filling swimming pools, garages and houses, and really spoiling the view. This is a story of debris basins and other human attempts to stop the mountains. Because the people won't move. There's the view, and the celebrities, the money, and sometimes the seeming privacy. As one resident said, \"If it gets where I can't pee off my front porch, I'll move.\" Oh, and another reason I read McPhee is that he will not say smog . No. Instead he writes this: The ascending effluents of the smelters, refineries, mills, and factories added a great burden to the marine fog layer--made heavier still as the work force moved about in cars. To describe this ochre cumulus, the world's shortest portmanteau word, which had been coined around 1905, was borrowed from London."

        "text":"If you asked me a week ago, or before I read this book, if I thought this would be a five star book I would have thought you were crazy. Her? This book? I would have probably told you I might never even read this book and that it made me bored to just read the copy on the back. And I can't even tell you why I started to read this. I was just sitting around my apartment, reading Ladies and Gentlemen, The Bible! , and I had about thirty pages left and I got restless and it was still light out, actually it was about 7 pm, and it's summer so that meant I still had an hour or so of light, and it was nicer outside than it was in my stuffy apartment so I decided to go outside and read, but I got afraid that I'd zip through the not-so-hilarious re-tellings of bible stories and after standing in the middle of my apartment looking in every direction trying to figure out which book to read next, I just grabbed this one, I don't know why, partly because it was on one of my little cardboard shelves and it was easy to see from where I was standing and I thought I'm not going to care too much about this, I'll be able to give it away when I'm done! And it's only 272 pages long, with sort of big print! Let's go read  about the control of nature. But I was so young and foolish and stupid then, a week ago, last Sunday. This book is so good! I can't do any justice to the book by trying to explain what it is about. If you goto this edition of the book you can read a fairly good description of what the book is about: here ! The easy response to just about any of the three stories that make up the basis for these essays (Man Versus The Mississippi River and it's natural inclination to 'move' to a more efficient route to the Gulf of Mexico and it's propensity to flood places like New Orleans, which is just asking for it; Man Versus slow moving lava and mountain (a fucking mountain, a moving fucking mountain on lava. And not an existing mountain, but a new mountain that didn't already exist, how awesome \/ twisted \/ mind bending is that? A big fissure opens in the ground, lava starts seeping out, big fire shit shoots into the sky some other geological stuff happens and from the side of a mountain comes another mountain that is moving and some guys with water pumps are trying to stop it) that are threatening to destroy a harbor on an Icelandic Island; and Man Versus millions of tons of rocks and boulders that come sliding off of mountains on the edge of Los Angeles when the conditions are right and destroy everything in their path), as I was saying, the easy response to these is 'well that's what you get for building \/ living there. But of course, like just about everything in life, when you start to find out more about the situation the easy response isn't so easy. Yeah, people don't need to have million dollar homes on the edge of mountains just waiting for the right combination of wildfire debris, big rains and loose ground from the very active mountains that are still in the process of rising to send rock slides, which can easily pull an automobile along with it, heading towards the expensive homes (and then these people, have the gall to try to sue for property damage they suffer, and sometimes apparently they even win (but sometimes rationality prevails and they don't and they are told, well you knew the risks)), but what do you do now that they are living there? And that they are living there and they are quite possibly extremely litigious? And then what do you think of the situation when you find out it's not just rich idiots living in those homes, but also pretty much the entire geology department of Cal Tech lives in this danger zone, the people who study what is going on here, and who know all of the dangers better than probably anyone else in the world, and they chose to live there. Can you imagine how great the area must be to knowingly risk having your home wiped out in seconds by raging rocks? My favorite part of the book was the Volcano essay that made up the center of the book. It was just amazing, and it didn't even need to rely on some of the silliness that Americans provide with their 'I'm going to sue you!' mentality that the very excellent \"Los Angeles Against the Mountains\" essay had going on it (it was very very good besides some of the silly stories). I don't know who is reading this right now, but you should read this essay, it's called \"Cooling the Lava\" and I can't put into words how great I thought it was. I'm sort of a bit in love with volcanos after reading it. I'll even cut this review short so that you can go find a copy of this book, or the essay and read it, and hopefully you wont think I steered you too wrong. The rest of this review would have just been gushing about how much I loved the book, or me saying something like \"why are people in Los Angeles so dumb?!?\", now go away and read the essay."

To mitigate against this, the Army Corps of Engineers has built several huge water exchangers that connect the two rivers under the theory that regulating the flow of Mississippi water into the Atchafalaya may forestall grand theft by the latter. As always, McPhee interviews just the right officials and employees at just the right time, and his descriptive similes are jewels: the spillway that transmits Mississippi water into the Atchafalaya goes \"sideways, like grain squirting out of a burlap bag.\" What do you do when red-hot lava from new or recent volcanoes threatens the nearest towns and cities? In Iceland, you pump literally millions of gallons of cold seawater on the magma, hoping it will stall into solid basalt and (eventually) stop the flow. In Hawaii, you try channelling, playing a dangerous game of curling to make the killer lava go somewhere slightly different than it had intended. This section is called \"Cooling the Lava\" and it is absolutely enthralling, as are the rugged academics, military folk and plain old citizens McPhee encounters in both places. The third section shows the full power of civilization, bureaucracy and high technology against the San Gabriel Mountains -- in other words \"Los Angeles Against the Mountains\" -- and in spite of millions upon millions spent for retaining walls, dry reservoirs to catch rain-loosed mud and dislodged bolders, it remains to be seen who will eventually win. Why, oh why, do people insist on nesting just below these flaky mountains? One reason is to get above the smog zone, making it something that can be seen but not breathed: Recalling that Southern California smog has its origin in natural sea fog: As you watch it from above through the morning and into the afternoon, it turns yellow, then ochre, then brown, and sometimes nearly black -- like butter darkening in a skillet. Verbally, McPhee is also no stranger to humor; lest I introduce spoilers I won't detail the jibes he gets off at one suburban Arby's, but watch out for them! All three segments, and therefore all of The Control of Nature , come highly recommended. The actual circumstances may have changed since McPhee first wrote his articles that became this can't-put-down book; the author's richly compelling way with words hasn't."

Information here includes some history of the US Army Corps of Engineers, an enlightening look at the history of flooding in New Orleans, an appreciation for the significance of the Atchafalaya, and a look at the geology and natural processes in effect in Los Angeles.Overall, the information presented in The Control of Nature is very interesting. Considering that it was published in 1989, and that I was unaware of the specifics involved, it has clearly not become common knowledge, and thus retains a bit of freshness. It might be nice to see a follow-up by the author, particularly as applied to the Mississippi and Los Angeles issues, in light of events since publication. I confess that I did not look for such, and it may well be out there. While the information in the book was interesting, it seemed to me that the writing was less so. McPhee offers a host of local personalities to illustrate the impact of these issues on people, and generically that approach is sound. Yet, the impact of that approach was minimal. I never felt that his portrayals went beyond what one might find in newspaper reportage of the day. One need not make characters come alive as a good novelist might, but his portrayals rarely rose above the mundane. I thought the book would have profited from the inclusion of illustrations. There is a brief section in which drawings are shown of structures no longer present in Iceland, but they added little."

        "text":"From time to time all hell will break forth from the mountains. To the question “Why, then, do people live there?” the answer seems to be that... they would rather defy nature than live without it. This is a very interesting book that looks at three different locations where people have tried to “control nature” and live where history and perhaps common sense says they probably shouldn't: — The Mississippi River has an enormous flood plain. People have been building levees for at least a couple of centuries, but that has the unintended effect of just sending more water to those who live further downriver. The Army Corps of Engineers built and maintains a river control structure that particularly protects those living in the Atchafalaya and New Orleans area, and keeps the end of the river from moving to another place. Atchafalaya. The word will now come to mind more or less in echo of any struggle against natural forces—heroic or venal, rash or well advised—when human beings conscript themselves to fight against the earth, to take what is not given, to rout the destroying enemy, to surround the base of Mt. Olympus demanding and expecting the surrender of the gods... I put [a green-and-white sticker that said “ATCHAFALAYA”] in a window of my car. It has been there for many years, causing drivers on the New Jersey Turnpike to veer in close and crowd my lane while staring at a word that signifies collision. — When the ground split open and started spewing red-hot lava into the sky above Heimaey, the largest island of Vestmannaeyjar in Iceland, some were more worried about protecting the harbor than the homes. When the lava flow started getting close, they began spraying water on it in an attempt to halt it in its tracks. But the lava had to go somewhere. Even in something as primal as a volcanic eruption, the component of human interference could apparently enter the narrative and, in complex and unpredictable geometries, alter the shape of succeeding events. After the human contribution passed a level higher than trifling, the evolution of the new landscape could in no pure sense be natural. The event had lost its status as a simple act of God. In making war with nature, there was risk of loss in winning. — The San Gabriel Mountains on the east side of Los Angeles are some of the steepest in the world due to plate tectonics. But in addition to earthquakes, the residents have to deal with fires and floods. And not just floods of water, but debris flows full of boulders, some larger than cars. “It’s a fantastic place to be in a storm. You hear a sound like giant castanets—boulders clicking together. They’re not pebbles. And there is a scent, which is absolutely heavenly, of the crushed chaparral plants. It’s so fragrant and beautiful it’s eerie to have it associated with something so terrifying. And, God knows, it is terrifying.” Although the book is a bit dated (first published in 1989), it's still a very interesting read. John McPhee has a clever way with words and it's kind of a pleasure to read, but he's also rather long-winded and frequently sarcastic. He often seems to disparage people for living in such places, even using the word \"dingbats\" in a couple of odd places. But he also seems to recognize the beauty of these locations. Overall, the book was an enjoyable read and fascinating to consider the power of nature, especially in the face of our hubris to try to modify and control it. However, throughout the book, I couldn't help but think of a quote from Werner Heisenberg, one of the founders of quantum theory, who reminds us that we are part of nature, too: “In classical physics, science started from the belief—or should one say, from the illusion?—that we could describe the world, or at least parts of the world, without any reference to ourselves.”"

County Flood Control District to keep the San Gabriel Mountains from squashing Los Angeles into a molehill. I don't know whether working on the Mississippi River (currently) or living near Los Angeles (about the time McPhee was writing this) should have made me more interested or less, but the truth is I found it hard to pay attention. That I had nothing at all similar to the experiences related in Cooling the Lava , where Icelanders saved their town by spraying water on a lava flow that threatened their town, didn't seem to make much difference though--I still had a hard time maintaining interest. I can't think of any good reason this should be so--McPhee is a good writer. Not too clever, slyly humorous on occasion but not to the point of overdoing it, informative and exhaustive; I can't point to anything that's wrong here. So I'm going to chalk it up to wrong book at the wrong time. That I found his book Looking for a Ship fascinating tells me that I'll still give McPhee plenty of other chances."

After the human contribution passed a level higher than trifling, the evolution of the new landscape could in no pure sense be natural. The event had lost its status as a simple act of God.

I got a little bogged down in the middle with the Icelandic names and lava issues, but the strong characters in the other two chapters bring the book’s theme out vividly. And troublingly. McPhee is careful not to imagine that control of nature is ever complete. The first chapter, written in the 80s about the levees and locks north of New Orleans, has the memory of Katrina looming over it. The last chapter—on the landslides, floods, and fires in the mountains around Los Angeles—was particularly disturbing today."

        "text":"John McPhee is an inspired observer, outdoorsman and a writer with ultimate mastery of the English language. This is an extract from the jacket. \"The Control of Nature is John McPhee's bestselling account of places in the world where people have been engaged in all-out battles with nature. In Louisiana, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has declared war on the lower Mississippi River, which threatens to follow a new route to the sea and cut off New Orleans and Baton Rouge from the rest of the United States. Icelanders confront flowing red lava in an attempt to save a crucial harbor. In Los Angeles, basins are built to catch devastating debris flows from the San Gabriel Mountains. Taking us deep into these contested territories, McPhee details the strategies and tactics through which people attempt to control nature. Most striking is his depiction of the main contestants: nature in complex and awesome guises, and those attempting to wrest control from her stubborn, sometimes foolhardy, more often ingenious, and always arresting characters.\" John's books frequently appear serialized in the New Yorker. Over the years I've read all of his 29 books. Many of his books like 'Basin to Range' are slow, many would consider them dull\" because they're primarily about geology. But individually and collectively they're my favorite books and I reread them on a regular basis. They're intensely interesting: 'Coming into the Country' is a collection of stories about the people of Alaska (way pre Sarah Palin), Informative to a fault: 'Oranges' and wonderfully absorbing, his newest, 'Uncommon Carriers'. 'Uncommon Carriers': Again an overview: \"Over the past eight years, John McPhee has spent considerable time in the company of people who work in freight transportation. Uncommon Carriers is his sketchbook of them and of his journeys with them. He rides from Atlanta to Tacoma alongside Don Ainsworth, owner and operator of a sixty-five-foot, eighteen-wheel chemical tanker carrying hazmats. McPhee attends ship-handling school on a pond in the foothills of the French Alps, where, for a tuition of $15,000 a week, skippers of the largest ocean ships refine their capabilities in twenty-foot scale models. He goes up the “tight-assed” Illinois River on a “towboat” pushing a triple string of barges, the overall vessel being “a good deal longer than the Titanic.” And he travels by canoe up the canal-and-lock commercial waterways traveled by Henry David Thoreau and his brother, John, in a homemade skiff in 1839. Uncommon Carriers is classic work by McPhee, in prose distinguished, as always, by its author’s warm humor, keen insight, and rich sense of human character.\" I enjoyed this book so much that I tried to read just a few pages a day to make it last, reading other books the rest of the time His little book, 'the making of a bark canoe' is classic McPhee. Full of painstaking detail about one young man's obsession with making authentic bark canoes, with simple tools, and canoeing trips with him to test them. John McPhee is an avid outdoorsman. It permeates his books. His books grown on one, become old friends and companions in life. A calm accurate, enthralling and literate observer of the worlds he discovers for the rest of us. Perhaps the best counter to too much fast and electronic information that I know of in out interactive, online, plugged in world, which I love also."

        "text":"This book is about people living in places where nature is in a state of constant change, and the extraordinary lengths they go to try to control the ultimately uncontrollable forces. It would be funny if it was fiction. A sheriff survives the inundation of his neighborhood by a massive debris slug only because it tosses him into the back of a pickup truck being carried along in the mud and boulders along with parts of houses. The absurdity of many of the eco-meets-ego situations reaches the Carl Hiaasen level, except these stories don’t take place in Florida. And they are real. Written in 1989, Control of Nature analyzes the economic, social and geological forces behind three man-vs.-nature struggles: the attempt to force the Mississippi River to behave in the way that permanently settled human communities want it to, and not to change course when it naturally would have done so; the fight to cool a lava flow in Iceland and save a fishing harbor; and the most absurd of all somehow, Los Angeles Against the Mountains, the persistence of people living in the eroding and also rising San Gabriels, where the combination of tectonic forces lifting the mountains and erosion and fire on their slopes leads to a constant flow of rocks toward LA. Big ones. Tons of them. The most depressing section was about the Mississippi. Hurricane Katrina made it all too clear how vulnerable people are when they live in places where only many man-made interventions have enabled them to be there—where it would be an entirely different ecosystem and landscape if left alone. As we know from the story of post-Katrina New Orleans, some people go back, though lot of people didn’t. On the island in Iceland where the volcano erupted, a lot of people didn’t go back, either, but many did. McPhee does a good job of getting the points of view of the people who choose the risk. Some people have no choice—they were born in a threatened place and don’t have the means to move, but others build or buy expensive homes on the slopes of unstable mountains. He finds experts on the geology of the San Gabriels who consciously live right in the path of potential debris flows, as well as real estate agents who blithely talk their way around the risk, reassuring potential buyers more than they ought to be reassured. McPhee’s interest in the human beings involved as well as the earth makes him a great story-teller. A little distractible, a little inclined to collect as many anecdotes as possible, but never dull. He can make alarming and complex scientific material readable without making it any less alarming. The issues are not old. I did a little research before writing this review. People studying the Old River Control structure where the Atchafalaya is being—for now—prevented from capturing the Mississippi still say McPhee’s article that was the basis for this book is the best thing ever written on the topic. Debris flows are still endangering California towns. People still live where nature could cover them up with water, lava or rocks on short notice, and they love those places or need them economically. Taxes pay for the structures that make it possible for them to be there, and for the recovery when disaster strikes. Decide what you think about that, after you read this book."

        "text":"The rivers WILL rise, the lava WILL burn, the mountains WILL crumble. So sayeth author John McPhee in his three-part reportage of man's attempts to control, divert or redirect nature's plans. His travels take him to the Mississippi Delta, where engineers have manufactured an artificial flood control to maintain the Ole Man in its present course rather than what the river wants to do: take over the neighboring Atchafalaya channel, thereby forever bypassing the river commerce hubs of Baton Rogue and New Orleans. It should come as no surprise--especially given the failure of the levees during Hurricane Katrina--that the attempt has been...less than all-successful. Written in 1989, this story especially resonates with what came only 16 years later for the Delta...and WILL come again. Then McPhee travels to Iceland, where an erupting volcano's lava flow threatens to fill in an important fishing harbor, following the brave (or vain) fight by the Icelanders to cool the lava flow before it completely destroys the economic center of their country. And lastly, to my adopted town Los Angeles, where the San Gabriel Mountains continue to crumble as plate tectonics push them up vertiginously and unstably, causing \"debris flows\" for those brave\/foolish\/enterprising folks who build homes in the canyons--and right in the firing line of the mudslides. This is a fascinating, humbling and frequently amusing read, almost classically Greek in its depictions of humankind's Sisyphusian efforts to circumvent God and Nature's plans and the inevitable disasters that follow. I live in Pasadena, at the very foot of the San Gabriels, right in the line of fire. And perhaps it is Providential that in a few short days I will travel to New Orleans...perhaps more keenly aware, as I sleep (and drink) of the dammed (and damned) river ready to swallow, at some indeterminate date, the neo-French settlement once and for all. It WILL happen."

        "text":"Fabulous book. Science, history, human intransigence, classical references and beautiful sentences. I’ve liked everything McPhee writes even if I knew nothing of the subject and had never considered it interesting enough to get informed. This books is three essays on human attempts to control nature, not just for the fun of it but to solve a problem where nature caused humans difficulty mainly because it disrupted they way humans were already interacting with nature. In the Mississippi example, the river wanted a new outlet to the Gulf and would have found it in the Atchafalaya River, a faster route because of the gradient and because it was the shortest route. It was predicted to happen naturally by 1991. But if it had, the cities of New Orleans and Baton Rouge, to say nothing of the industry which had been built up around them would have been cut off. And the Atchafalaya Swamp country (Cajun country) would also be changed. So the Corps of Engineers, beginning in the Sixties built a flood control structure that was designed to send no more than 30% of the water down the Atchafalaya while the rest was directed down the “old route”. On an Icelandic island which was essentially a fishing community, a new volcano sprouted and seemed about not only to engulf the town but to destroy the harbor, a harbor from which fisherman caught a major portion of Iceland's main export, fish. Eventually they tried using water from high powered hoses to cool the lava flow and direct it away from the harbor. Much of the town was inundated, but the harbor was saved, even though it ended up with a new volcano on its edge. In Los Angeles, people began to move to the hills in front of the San Gabriel Mountains and the more the hillsides were built up and the more people moved to the hills, the more disastrous floods and debris runs caused death and destruction. The cause was pretty complex. The chaparral would burn and become water proof. Then when winter rainstorms came, the water would not soak into the ground but cause floods and debris runs. Whole trees and huge boulders would rush down the mountain taking with it anything in the path: whole automobiles and other large objects from the highest homes and picking up more as it went. The solution was debris fans which channeled the debris to pickup points from which the city hauled it away, millions of tons.... these debris fans were pretty successful but there was no dissuading people from buying or building in the hills, higher and higher into the hills. Because these debris runs occurred infrequently and residents for the most part didn’t understand the conditions that made them possible, the danger was not taken seriously enough. Fascinating book. Published in 1989. We still hear of these awful floods and debris runs in LA, though I never realized there was more to it than floods. The Mississippi has not deserted New Orleans though the ecological problems there make one wonder. Vestmannseyjar has not been overcome with lava and evidently Hawaii has learned some from their example. I’d love to have a 2019 update on these projects."

        "text":"Ironically named book that recounts three episodes where humans have tried to resist the mighty forces of nature: 1. It's a natural phenomenon for a river to change course. Natural or man-made obstructions come and go, but the water still has to get from here to there. About every 1000 years, the mouth (outlet) of the Mississippi River changes course. Silt builds up and begins to slow the flow into the Gulf. A slower flow deposits more sediment, and the process accelerates. Eventually, the water finds a steeper path to the gulf, and the river's course changes. Around 1950, scientists realized that the Mississippi was getting ready to relocate a few hundred miles west. That would have left New Orleans without a port or drinking water. Ditto Baton Rouge. The Army Corps of Engineers was directed to make sure that didn't happen. They have succeeded (for now) but with an unending comedy of fixes to fixes to fixes. For example, they might build a three foot levy to prevent flooding. But the former flood plain, denied water and sediment, subsides. So the levy now has to be six feet or nine feet to keep the river in its banks. That it does, but... unintended consequences follow. 2. A volcano in Iceland erupted. The lava flow threatened to fill in Iceland's only southern port. Civil defense authorities fought the lava flow by pouring millions of gallons of water on the leading edge of the lava. The idea was to cool it enough to harden and form a dam, stopping the lava from overflowing the port. Did it work? Well, there's still a port there. But the town got wiped out by the redirected lava. 3. The San Gabriel mountains in southern California are having a growth spurt. They are thrusting up at a lightning pace, at least in geologic terms. Boulders become exposed to the elements and gravity. Periodic wild fires turn the mountainsides into playground slides. When a heavy rain comes, debris flows (like wet cement spiced with Volkswagen-sized boulders) slide down the hills and invite themselves into the homes at the bottom of the mountains. Engineers design basins and drainage canals to catch the debris flows, but they need to be emptied continuously, and where do you put this stuff? The author has a dry sense of humor and resists the urge to be snarky. His point is clear: If it's human ingenuity against nature, put your money on nature."

        "text":"The effort involved in moving a powerful river, steering a volcanic eruption, or challenging gravity's hold on a mountain is clearly documented and described by McPhee's engaging - albeit dry - narrative. This is a fun book to read if only to get a sense of what huge projects people will embark on to protect their way of life. It's a shame that the projects are ultimately useless because the scale that nature operates on simply dwarfs what civil engineering can handle. Read this book if you'd like to see what living on the edge is like in such exotic locations as Louisiana and Los Angeles (what!). I thought this book was quite fascinating - the two U.S. locations that were explored were quite eye opening. I thought I was pretty well aware of what's going on nationally, but some things just slip past. The story about the islands off the coast of Iceland was also nice, McPhee gave a good description of the mentality of Icelanders. Collectively, I think the three stories paint a diverse picture of peoples' attempts to \"improve\" their surroundings for material gain, but they're lacking something. As I read this book, it became very evident that they have been published serially (in the New Yorker) and the three sections of the book were not really tied together in any direct way (besides the obvious thematic connection). It just struck me as a somewhat lazy thing to do after putting together all the research on each of the individual bits. That aspect doesn't take away from the purpose of the book, but it's a missed opportunity to add more analysis for readers who have missed the original publications. Speaking of analysis, if you're looking for a strong opinion on the various projects that are discussed, you'll have to look somewhere beyond this book. This is not exactly a detraction: McPhee provided a fair amount of evidence to describe each of the projects and the effect on the relevant communities. You can make up your own mind on the value of the engineering efforts, and will have a good starting point if you'd like to go deeper in any of these areas. That said, simply by writing these books McPhee expressed his own opinion on the apparent follies awaiting nature to take its course. As you may have gathered by now, this review has purposefully skirted the actual contents of the book. This is not because there's nothing to discuss, but rather the story is better told by McPhee than me. It's an entertaining book that delivers exactly what I expected from the title and cover. Could it have done more? Sure. Was it worth going through? I think so."

        "text":"Despite the rave reviews, I find this book a little hard to love. This is a collection of three journalistic pieces, covering the stories of how the US Army Corp of Engineers sought to keep the Mississippi river from diverting into another branch and cutting off New Orleans, how Icelandic government stopped a branch of a lava flow from blocking up a harbor, and how the Californian government tried to minimize damages from the unpredictable debris flow coming down from the crumbling San Gabriel mountains. While the topic of the stories are intriguing, and the author did a great job describing all the facets of these complex stories, I found the approach a little \"too broad.\" Sometimes, I get confused by the recurrent episodes of disasters that happened every decade or so, not sure whether I'm reading about an episode that occurred in 1972, or 1913, or 1951. Sometimes, I doubt if it was necessary for me to know the opinion of one particular geology professor, after already hearing the opinion of several others in a row. In the end, I do find it a remarkable feat of journalism to give such a comprehensive coverage to these stories and demonstrate the absurdity and ingenuity of the engineers at the same time. Every time I have a question in my mind, e.g. if they collected all the debris in these dams, what do they do with them? The author already followed up with a segment answering those question, e.g. they broke it down and used it on the beaches or they engineered storms to wash them away. It is a great book for seeing how versatile the New Yorker style of reporting (and writing) can be, how it can effectively tell stories from local cultural events to large, earth-changing cataclysms, while still touching the readers' hearts. But at the same time, for readers who have no specific interst in the topic, this may be just all a little bit too much to digest."

McPhee mixes big-picture exposition with archive material and quotes from personal, on-site interviews, always lively and often playful. Through it all he combines a stunned amazement that we dare even attempt this with some serious respect for the people that do it. Takeaways: 1. Southern Louisiana is actually constitutionally opposed to permanent, earthbound human settlements. The continued existence of New Orleans and Morgan City can be largely attributed to the bloodyminded struggle of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which has been wrestling with the Mississippi River for decades in an effort to prevent it from going where it will, eventually, go. 2. The people of Iceland went to war with a volcano and, acting as foot soldiers for the sea, won. 3. By any traditional reckoning, Los Angeles has clearly been condemned by several deities. I knew wildfires were an issue there, but I didn't realise that a lot of the explosively flammable brush actually renders the ground below a shallow layer hydrophobic, contributing to massive debris flows that attempt to sweep away or at least bury most of the city (which also sits on top of a massive tectonic faultline). You could feel McPhee's jaw dropping as he spoke to people who brushed off the suggestion that their house could quite probably be washed away by gigantic debris swells."

Man and his abode face disaster in these stories. Man could move, of course; and some do. But others try to control nature. As if. One real river pilot - meaning not Mark Twain - is quoted here: Mother Nature is patient. . . . Mother Nature has more time than we do. I knew, of course, that the Mississippi floods, that volcanoes bubble, and that Los Angeles has random fires and mudslides. Yet I didn't know the science of it. As he always does, John McPhee here blends history, science, biography, anecdote and the occasional personal intrusion to explain it all. Man versus Nature. Who will win? Atchafalaya People settled in New Orleans and Baton Rouge. They became thriving cities and important ports well before it became apparent there was a problem. The Atchafalaya (rhymes with jambalaya) runs roughly parallel to the Mississippi. It just lies there quiet and smooth. It lies there like a big alligator in a low slough, with time on its side, waiting--waiting to outwit the Corps of Engineers--and hunkering down ever lower in its bed and presenting a sort of maw to the Mississippi, into which the river could fall. It is the Atchafalaya's raison d'être to capture the Mississippi. And it would, maybe already would have, if Nature was allowed to run its course. The Mississippi \"is just itching to go that way,\" Congress was told in 1928. And if it did, well, New Orleans and Baton Rouge would be underwater and the Saints would be playing home football games about 150 miles to the west. So they built levees, and then ever higher and higher levees. But the Atchafalaya is not going away, nor is its seeming purpose. Stay tuned. One of the reasons I read McPhee is for his humor, which can sneak up on you. In referencing The War of 1812, McPhee begins a sentence: When that unusual year was in its thirty-sixth month . . . Cooling the Lava I said above that sometimes people settle in a place for the view and you can see why folks are reluctant to leave Vestmannaeyjar, a town and archipelago off the south coast of Iceland: Until, of course, this happens: Iceland, I learned, is volcanic, a hot spot. Or, as McPhee writes: Iceland is the geologic chocolate shop of this minor planet. But there's that view. So some people left, but others came back. A lot of this section is about how Iceland tries to control the lava flow, shooting streams of water at it that works, sort of. It worked well enough that other countries brought the Icelanders in to see if they could help. They couldn't help in Hawaii. There McPhee went, took the obligatory visits to Mauna Kea and Mauna Loa. Then he went to Kilauea and, after appropriate waivers, climbed to the top. McPhee wrote: Kilauea since 1983 has not been quiet for fifteen minutes. I read the section on Kilauea, paused for a sip of red wine since it was handy, and heard my cellphone buzz with an alert: Kilauea had just erupted. My reading life gets spookier and spookier. Anyhow, I also read McPhee because he just writes with a wide-angle lens. Speaking of Mauna Loa: The long mountain is fifty miles long. Viewed from the edge of the ocean, it is an astonishing trompe-l'oeil, because it is so smoothly constructed that it appears in two dimensions and presents a deceptive depth of field. It looks like a low friendly hill, a singing dune, at worst a bald Scottish brae. You think, I'll run up there and have a look around before lunch. The long mountain is as high as the Alps. If it were dissected by streams--given promontories and reentrants, serrated by canyons, invaded by shadows--it might look something like the Alps. As is, it's just a massive shield, composed of chilled magma, looking the way the Alps would look if a dentist could repair them. Los Angeles Against the Mountains Fires and mudslides in Los Angeles are widely reported on (Oprah's house being front page news), but I never knew the particulars of why they happened. It turns out there are many factors, not excluding human foible. Los Angeles sprawls. On one side is the Pacific Ocean, and on the other side is the San Gabriel Mountains. On these particular mountains is chaparral which will burn in large swaths. Humans are often the culprit. But when chaparral is consumed by fire it makes the ground essentially waterproof. Then it's a matter of waiting for the winter rains. Boulders come loose, join with mud, and trees and cars and parts of buildings in the way. It's not just the water. It's massive debris, filling swimming pools, garages and houses, and really spoiling the view. This is a story of debris basins and other human attempts to stop the mountains. Because the people won't move. There's the view, and the celebrities, the money, and sometimes the seeming privacy. As one resident said, \"If it gets where I can't pee off my front porch, I'll move.\" Oh, and another reason I read McPhee is that he will not say smog . No. Instead he writes this: The ascending effluents of the smelters, refineries, mills, and factories added a great burden to the marine fog layer--made heavier still as the work force moved about in cars. To describe this ochre cumulus, the world's shortest portmanteau word, which had been coined around 1905, was borrowed from London."

        "text":"If you asked me a week ago, or before I read this book, if I thought this would be a five star book I would have thought you were crazy. Her? This book? I would have probably told you I might never even read this book and that it made me bored to just read the copy on the back. And I can't even tell you why I started to read this. I was just sitting around my apartment, reading Ladies and Gentlemen, The Bible! , and I had about thirty pages left and I got restless and it was still light out, actually it was about 7 pm, and it's summer so that meant I still had an hour or so of light, and it was nicer outside than it was in my stuffy apartment so I decided to go outside and read, but I got afraid that I'd zip through the not-so-hilarious re-tellings of bible stories and after standing in the middle of my apartment looking in every direction trying to figure out which book to read next, I just grabbed this one, I don't know why, partly because it was on one of my little cardboard shelves and it was easy to see from where I was standing and I thought I'm not going to care too much about this, I'll be able to give it away when I'm done! And it's only 272 pages long, with sort of big print! Let's go read  about the control of nature. But I was so young and foolish and stupid then, a week ago, last Sunday. This book is so good! I can't do any justice to the book by trying to explain what it is about. If you goto this edition of the book you can read a fairly good description of what the book is about: here ! The easy response to just about any of the three stories that make up the basis for these essays (Man Versus The Mississippi River and it's natural inclination to 'move' to a more efficient route to the Gulf of Mexico and it's propensity to flood places like New Orleans, which is just asking for it; Man Versus slow moving lava and mountain (a fucking mountain, a moving fucking mountain on lava. And not an existing mountain, but a new mountain that didn't already exist, how awesome \/ twisted \/ mind bending is that? A big fissure opens in the ground, lava starts seeping out, big fire shit shoots into the sky some other geological stuff happens and from the side of a mountain comes another mountain that is moving and some guys with water pumps are trying to stop it) that are threatening to destroy a harbor on an Icelandic Island; and Man Versus millions of tons of rocks and boulders that come sliding off of mountains on the edge of Los Angeles when the conditions are right and destroy everything in their path), as I was saying, the easy response to these is 'well that's what you get for building \/ living there. But of course, like just about everything in life, when you start to find out more about the situation the easy response isn't so easy. Yeah, people don't need to have million dollar homes on the edge of mountains just waiting for the right combination of wildfire debris, big rains and loose ground from the very active mountains that are still in the process of rising to send rock slides, which can easily pull an automobile along with it, heading towards the expensive homes (and then these people, have the gall to try to sue for property damage they suffer, and sometimes apparently they even win (but sometimes rationality prevails and they don't and they are told, well you knew the risks)), but what do you do now that they are living there? And that they are living there and they are quite possibly extremely litigious? And then what do you think of the situation when you find out it's not just rich idiots living in those homes, but also pretty much the entire geology department of Cal Tech lives in this danger zone, the people who study what is going on here, and who know all of the dangers better than probably anyone else in the world, and they chose to live there. Can you imagine how great the area must be to knowingly risk having your home wiped out in seconds by raging rocks? My favorite part of the book was the Volcano essay that made up the center of the book. It was just amazing, and it didn't even need to rely on some of the silliness that Americans provide with their 'I'm going to sue you!' mentality that the very excellent \"Los Angeles Against the Mountains\" essay had going on it (it was very very good besides some of the silly stories). I don't know who is reading this right now, but you should read this essay, it's called \"Cooling the Lava\" and I can't put into words how great I thought it was. I'm sort of a bit in love with volcanos after reading it. I'll even cut this review short so that you can go find a copy of this book, or the essay and read it, and hopefully you wont think I steered you too wrong. The rest of this review would have just been gushing about how much I loved the book, or me saying something like \"why are people in Los Angeles so dumb?!?\", now go away and read the essay."

        "text":"Although these three extended essays all ran in the NEW YORKER magazine nearly 30 years ago, they retain the power to educate, amuse, and shock, and all show John McPhee, master of nonfiction, at his best. \"Atchafalaya\" details the growth of the still little-known waterway that runs roughly parallel to the Mississippi and -- here's the real shock -- might someday \"seize\" the mainstream of the mighty Mississip', leaving towns like Baton Rouge and New Orleans high and dry, without outlet. To mitigate against this, the Army Corps of Engineers has built several huge water exchangers that connect the two rivers under the theory that regulating the flow of Mississippi water into the Atchafalaya may forestall grand theft by the latter. As always, McPhee interviews just the right officials and employees at just the right time, and his descriptive similes are jewels: the spillway that transmits Mississippi water into the Atchafalaya goes \"sideways, like grain squirting out of a burlap bag.\" What do you do when red-hot lava from new or recent volcanoes threatens the nearest towns and cities? In Iceland, you pump literally millions of gallons of cold seawater on the magma, hoping it will stall into solid basalt and (eventually) stop the flow. In Hawaii, you try channelling, playing a dangerous game of curling to make the killer lava go somewhere slightly different than it had intended. This section is called \"Cooling the Lava\" and it is absolutely enthralling, as are the rugged academics, military folk and plain old citizens McPhee encounters in both places. The third section shows the full power of civilization, bureaucracy and high technology against the San Gabriel Mountains -- in other words \"Los Angeles Against the Mountains\" -- and in spite of millions upon millions spent for retaining walls, dry reservoirs to catch rain-loosed mud and dislodged bolders, it remains to be seen who will eventually win. Why, oh why, do people insist on nesting just below these flaky mountains? One reason is to get above the smog zone, making it something that can be seen but not breathed: Recalling that Southern California smog has its origin in natural sea fog: As you watch it from above through the morning and into the afternoon, it turns yellow, then ochre, then brown, and sometimes nearly black -- like butter darkening in a skillet. Verbally, McPhee is also no stranger to humor; lest I introduce spoilers I won't detail the jibes he gets off at one suburban Arby's, but watch out for them! All three segments, and therefore all of The Control of Nature , come highly recommended. The actual circumstances may have changed since McPhee first wrote his articles that became this can't-put-down book; the author's richly compelling way with words hasn't."

Information here includes some history of the US Army Corps of Engineers, an enlightening look at the history of flooding in New Orleans, an appreciation for the significance of the Atchafalaya, and a look at the geology and natural processes in effect in Los Angeles.Overall, the information presented in The Control of Nature is very interesting. Considering that it was published in 1989, and that I was unaware of the specifics involved, it has clearly not become common knowledge, and thus retains a bit of freshness. It might be nice to see a follow-up by the author, particularly as applied to the Mississippi and Los Angeles issues, in light of events since publication. I confess that I did not look for such, and it may well be out there. While the information in the book was interesting, it seemed to me that the writing was less so. McPhee offers a host of local personalities to illustrate the impact of these issues on people, and generically that approach is sound. Yet, the impact of that approach was minimal. I never felt that his portrayals went beyond what one might find in newspaper reportage of the day. One need not make characters come alive as a good novelist might, but his portrayals rarely rose above the mundane. I thought the book would have profited from the inclusion of illustrations. There is a brief section in which drawings are shown of structures no longer present in Iceland, but they added little."

        "text":"From time to time all hell will break forth from the mountains. To the question “Why, then, do people live there?” the answer seems to be that... they would rather defy nature than live without it. This is a very interesting book that looks at three different locations where people have tried to “control nature” and live where history and perhaps common sense says they probably shouldn't: — The Mississippi River has an enormous flood plain. People have been building levees for at least a couple of centuries, but that has the unintended effect of just sending more water to those who live further downriver. The Army Corps of Engineers built and maintains a river control structure that particularly protects those living in the Atchafalaya and New Orleans area, and keeps the end of the river from moving to another place. Atchafalaya. The word will now come to mind more or less in echo of any struggle against natural forces—heroic or venal, rash or well advised—when human beings conscript themselves to fight against the earth, to take what is not given, to rout the destroying enemy, to surround the base of Mt. Olympus demanding and expecting the surrender of the gods... I put [a green-and-white sticker that said “ATCHAFALAYA”] in a window of my car. It has been there for many years, causing drivers on the New Jersey Turnpike to veer in close and crowd my lane while staring at a word that signifies collision. — When the ground split open and started spewing red-hot lava into the sky above Heimaey, the largest island of Vestmannaeyjar in Iceland, some were more worried about protecting the harbor than the homes. When the lava flow started getting close, they began spraying water on it in an attempt to halt it in its tracks. But the lava had to go somewhere. Even in something as primal as a volcanic eruption, the component of human interference could apparently enter the narrative and, in complex and unpredictable geometries, alter the shape of succeeding events. After the human contribution passed a level higher than trifling, the evolution of the new landscape could in no pure sense be natural. The event had lost its status as a simple act of God. In making war with nature, there was risk of loss in winning. — The San Gabriel Mountains on the east side of Los Angeles are some of the steepest in the world due to plate tectonics. But in addition to earthquakes, the residents have to deal with fires and floods. And not just floods of water, but debris flows full of boulders, some larger than cars. “It’s a fantastic place to be in a storm. You hear a sound like giant castanets—boulders clicking together. They’re not pebbles. And there is a scent, which is absolutely heavenly, of the crushed chaparral plants. It’s so fragrant and beautiful it’s eerie to have it associated with something so terrifying. And, God knows, it is terrifying.” Although the book is a bit dated (first published in 1989), it's still a very interesting read. John McPhee has a clever way with words and it's kind of a pleasure to read, but he's also rather long-winded and frequently sarcastic. He often seems to disparage people for living in such places, even using the word \"dingbats\" in a couple of odd places. But he also seems to recognize the beauty of these locations. Overall, the book was an enjoyable read and fascinating to consider the power of nature, especially in the face of our hubris to try to modify and control it. However, throughout the book, I couldn't help but think of a quote from Werner Heisenberg, one of the founders of quantum theory, who reminds us that we are part of nature, too: “In classical physics, science started from the belief—or should one say, from the illusion?—that we could describe the world, or at least parts of the world, without any reference to ourselves.”"

I always gave McPhee credit for being able to make a wallpaper seminar given in northern England sound like the high point of a trip to Europe, but in The Control of Nature , a book about things decidedly more interesting than wallpaper, I found my mind kept wandering. It may not have helped that for two out of his three subjects, I have peripheral experience: in Atchafalaya , McPhee describes the efforts by the Army Corps of Engineers to keep the Mississippi River contained within its traditional courses, and in Los Angeles Against the Mountains . the efforts of the L.A. County Flood Control District to keep the San Gabriel Mountains from squashing Los Angeles into a molehill. I don't know whether working on the Mississippi River (currently) or living near Los Angeles (about the time McPhee was writing this) should have made me more interested or less, but the truth is I found it hard to pay attention. That I had nothing at all similar to the experiences related in Cooling the Lava , where Icelanders saved their town by spraying water on a lava flow that threatened their town, didn't seem to make much difference though--I still had a hard time maintaining interest. I can't think of any good reason this should be so--McPhee is a good writer. Not too clever, slyly humorous on occasion but not to the point of overdoing it, informative and exhaustive; I can't point to anything that's wrong here. So I'm going to chalk it up to wrong book at the wrong time. That I found his book Looking for a Ship fascinating tells me that I'll still give McPhee plenty of other chances."

This is an extract from the jacket. \"The Control of Nature is John McPhee's bestselling account of places in the world where people have been engaged in all-out battles with nature. In Louisiana, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has declared war on the lower Mississippi River, which threatens to follow a new route to the sea and cut off New Orleans and Baton Rouge from the rest of the United States. Icelanders confront flowing red lava in an attempt to save a crucial harbor. In Los Angeles, basins are built to catch devastating debris flows from the San Gabriel Mountains. Taking us deep into these contested territories, McPhee details the strategies and tactics through which people attempt to control nature. Most striking is his depiction of the main contestants: nature in complex and awesome guises, and those attempting to wrest control from her stubborn, sometimes foolhardy, more often ingenious, and always arresting characters.\" John's books frequently appear serialized in the New Yorker. Over the years I've read all of his 29 books. Many of his books like 'Basin to Range' are slow, many would consider them dull\" because they're primarily about geology. But individually and collectively they're my favorite books and I reread them on a regular basis. They're intensely interesting: 'Coming into the Country' is a collection of stories about the people of Alaska (way pre Sarah Palin), Informative to a fault: 'Oranges' and wonderfully absorbing, his newest, 'Uncommon Carriers'. 'Uncommon Carriers': Again an overview: \"Over the past eight years, John McPhee has spent considerable time in the company of people who work in freight transportation. Uncommon Carriers is his sketchbook of them and of his journeys with them. He rides from Atlanta to Tacoma alongside Don Ainsworth, owner and operator of a sixty-five-foot, eighteen-wheel chemical tanker carrying hazmats. McPhee attends ship-handling school on a pond in the foothills of the French Alps, where, for a tuition of $15,000 a week, skippers of the largest ocean ships refine their capabilities in twenty-foot scale models. He goes up the “tight-assed” Illinois River on a “towboat” pushing a triple string of barges, the overall vessel being “a good deal longer than the Titanic.” And he travels by canoe up the canal-and-lock commercial waterways traveled by Henry David Thoreau and his brother, John, in a homemade skiff in 1839. Uncommon Carriers is classic work by McPhee, in prose distinguished, as always, by its author’s warm humor, keen insight, and rich sense of human character.\" I enjoyed this book so much that I tried to read just a few pages a day to make it last, reading other books the rest of the time His little book, 'the making of a bark canoe' is classic McPhee. Full of painstaking detail about one young man's obsession with making authentic bark canoes, with simple tools, and canoeing trips with him to test them. John McPhee is an avid outdoorsman. It permeates his books. His books grown on one, become old friends and companions in life. A calm accurate, enthralling and literate observer of the worlds he discovers for the rest of us. Perhaps the best counter to too much fast and electronic information that I know of in out interactive, online, plugged in world, which I love also."

        "text":"This book is about people living in places where nature is in a state of constant change, and the extraordinary lengths they go to try to control the ultimately uncontrollable forces. It would be funny if it was fiction. A sheriff survives the inundation of his neighborhood by a massive debris slug only because it tosses him into the back of a pickup truck being carried along in the mud and boulders along with parts of houses. The absurdity of many of the eco-meets-ego situations reaches the Carl Hiaasen level, except these stories don’t take place in Florida. And they are real. Written in 1989, Control of Nature analyzes the economic, social and geological forces behind three man-vs.-nature struggles: the attempt to force the Mississippi River to behave in the way that permanently settled human communities want it to, and not to change course when it naturally would have done so; the fight to cool a lava flow in Iceland and save a fishing harbor; and the most absurd of all somehow, Los Angeles Against the Mountains, the persistence of people living in the eroding and also rising San Gabriels, where the combination of tectonic forces lifting the mountains and erosion and fire on their slopes leads to a constant flow of rocks toward LA. Big ones. Tons of them. The most depressing section was about the Mississippi. Hurricane Katrina made it all too clear how vulnerable people are when they live in places where only many man-made interventions have enabled them to be there—where it would be an entirely different ecosystem and landscape if left alone. As we know from the story of post-Katrina New Orleans, some people go back, though lot of people didn’t. On the island in Iceland where the volcano erupted, a lot of people didn’t go back, either, but many did. McPhee does a good job of getting the points of view of the people who choose the risk. Some people have no choice—they were born in a threatened place and don’t have the means to move, but others build or buy expensive homes on the slopes of unstable mountains. He finds experts on the geology of the San Gabriels who consciously live right in the path of potential debris flows, as well as real estate agents who blithely talk their way around the risk, reassuring potential buyers more than they ought to be reassured. McPhee’s interest in the human beings involved as well as the earth makes him a great story-teller. A little distractible, a little inclined to collect as many anecdotes as possible, but never dull. He can make alarming and complex scientific material readable without making it any less alarming. The issues are not old. I did a little research before writing this review. People studying the Old River Control structure where the Atchafalaya is being—for now—prevented from capturing the Mississippi still say McPhee’s article that was the basis for this book is the best thing ever written on the topic. Debris flows are still endangering California towns. People still live where nature could cover them up with water, lava or rocks on short notice, and they love those places or need them economically. Taxes pay for the structures that make it possible for them to be there, and for the recovery when disaster strikes. Decide what you think about that, after you read this book."

        "text":"The rivers WILL rise, the lava WILL burn, the mountains WILL crumble. So sayeth author John McPhee in his three-part reportage of man's attempts to control, divert or redirect nature's plans. His travels take him to the Mississippi Delta, where engineers have manufactured an artificial flood control to maintain the Ole Man in its present course rather than what the river wants to do: take over the neighboring Atchafalaya channel, thereby forever bypassing the river commerce hubs of Baton Rogue and New Orleans. It should come as no surprise--especially given the failure of the levees during Hurricane Katrina--that the attempt has been...less than all-successful. Written in 1989, this story especially resonates with what came only 16 years later for the Delta...and WILL come again. Then McPhee travels to Iceland, where an erupting volcano's lava flow threatens to fill in an important fishing harbor, following the brave (or vain) fight by the Icelanders to cool the lava flow before it completely destroys the economic center of their country. And lastly, to my adopted town Los Angeles, where the San Gabriel Mountains continue to crumble as plate tectonics push them up vertiginously and unstably, causing \"debris flows\" for those brave\/foolish\/enterprising folks who build homes in the canyons--and right in the firing line of the mudslides. This is a fascinating, humbling and frequently amusing read, almost classically Greek in its depictions of humankind's Sisyphusian efforts to circumvent God and Nature's plans and the inevitable disasters that follow. I live in Pasadena, at the very foot of the San Gabriels, right in the line of fire. And perhaps it is Providential that in a few short days I will travel to New Orleans...perhaps more keenly aware, as I sleep (and drink) of the dammed (and damned) river ready to swallow, at some indeterminate date, the neo-French settlement once and for all. It WILL happen."

        "text":"Fabulous book. Science, history, human intransigence, classical references and beautiful sentences. I’ve liked everything McPhee writes even if I knew nothing of the subject and had never considered it interesting enough to get informed. This books is three essays on human attempts to control nature, not just for the fun of it but to solve a problem where nature caused humans difficulty mainly because it disrupted they way humans were already interacting with nature. In the Mississippi example, the river wanted a new outlet to the Gulf and would have found it in the Atchafalaya River, a faster route because of the gradient and because it was the shortest route. It was predicted to happen naturally by 1991. But if it had, the cities of New Orleans and Baton Rouge, to say nothing of the industry which had been built up around them would have been cut off. And the Atchafalaya Swamp country (Cajun country) would also be changed. So the Corps of Engineers, beginning in the Sixties built a flood control structure that was designed to send no more than 30% of the water down the Atchafalaya while the rest was directed down the “old route”. On an Icelandic island which was essentially a fishing community, a new volcano sprouted and seemed about not only to engulf the town but to destroy the harbor, a harbor from which fisherman caught a major portion of Iceland's main export, fish. Eventually they tried using water from high powered hoses to cool the lava flow and direct it away from the harbor. Much of the town was inundated, but the harbor was saved, even though it ended up with a new volcano on its edge. In Los Angeles, people began to move to the hills in front of the San Gabriel Mountains and the more the hillsides were built up and the more people moved to the hills, the more disastrous floods and debris runs caused death and destruction. The cause was pretty complex. The chaparral would burn and become water proof. Then when winter rainstorms came, the water would not soak into the ground but cause floods and debris runs. Whole trees and huge boulders would rush down the mountain taking with it anything in the path: whole automobiles and other large objects from the highest homes and picking up more as it went. The solution was debris fans which channeled the debris to pickup points from which the city hauled it away, millions of tons.... these debris fans were pretty successful but there was no dissuading people from buying or building in the hills, higher and higher into the hills. Because these debris runs occurred infrequently and residents for the most part didn’t understand the conditions that made them possible, the danger was not taken seriously enough. Fascinating book. Published in 1989. We still hear of these awful floods and debris runs in LA, though I never realized there was more to it than floods. The Mississippi has not deserted New Orleans though the ecological problems there make one wonder. Vestmannseyjar has not been overcome with lava and evidently Hawaii has learned some from their example. I’d love to have a 2019 update on these projects."

        "text":"Ironically named book that recounts three episodes where humans have tried to resist the mighty forces of nature: 1. It's a natural phenomenon for a river to change course. Natural or man-made obstructions come and go, but the water still has to get from here to there. About every 1000 years, the mouth (outlet) of the Mississippi River changes course. Silt builds up and begins to slow the flow into the Gulf. A slower flow deposits more sediment, and the process accelerates. Eventually, the water finds a steeper path to the gulf, and the river's course changes. Around 1950, scientists realized that the Mississippi was getting ready to relocate a few hundred miles west. That would have left New Orleans without a port or drinking water. Ditto Baton Rouge. The Army Corps of Engineers was directed to make sure that didn't happen. They have succeeded (for now) but with an unending comedy of fixes to fixes to fixes. For example, they might build a three foot levy to prevent flooding. But the former flood plain, denied water and sediment, subsides. So the levy now has to be six feet or nine feet to keep the river in its banks. That it does, but... unintended consequences follow. 2. A volcano in Iceland erupted. The lava flow threatened to fill in Iceland's only southern port. Civil defense authorities fought the lava flow by pouring millions of gallons of water on the leading edge of the lava. The idea was to cool it enough to harden and form a dam, stopping the lava from overflowing the port. Did it work? Well, there's still a port there. But the town got wiped out by the redirected lava. 3. The San Gabriel mountains in southern California are having a growth spurt. They are thrusting up at a lightning pace, at least in geologic terms. Boulders become exposed to the elements and gravity. Periodic wild fires turn the mountainsides into playground slides. When a heavy rain comes, debris flows (like wet cement spiced with Volkswagen-sized boulders) slide down the hills and invite themselves into the homes at the bottom of the mountains. Engineers design basins and drainage canals to catch the debris flows, but they need to be emptied continuously, and where do you put this stuff? The author has a dry sense of humor and resists the urge to be snarky. His point is clear: If it's human ingenuity against nature, put your money on nature."

        "text":"The effort involved in moving a powerful river, steering a volcanic eruption, or challenging gravity's hold on a mountain is clearly documented and described by McPhee's engaging - albeit dry - narrative. This is a fun book to read if only to get a sense of what huge projects people will embark on to protect their way of life. It's a shame that the projects are ultimately useless because the scale that nature operates on simply dwarfs what civil engineering can handle. Read this book if you'd like to see what living on the edge is like in such exotic locations as Louisiana and Los Angeles (what!). I thought this book was quite fascinating - the two U.S. locations that were explored were quite eye opening. I thought I was pretty well aware of what's going on nationally, but some things just slip past. The story about the islands off the coast of Iceland was also nice, McPhee gave a good description of the mentality of Icelanders. Collectively, I think the three stories paint a diverse picture of peoples' attempts to \"improve\" their surroundings for material gain, but they're lacking something. As I read this book, it became very evident that they have been published serially (in the New Yorker) and the three sections of the book were not really tied together in any direct way (besides the obvious thematic connection). It just struck me as a somewhat lazy thing to do after putting together all the research on each of the individual bits. That aspect doesn't take away from the purpose of the book, but it's a missed opportunity to add more analysis for readers who have missed the original publications. Speaking of analysis, if you're looking for a strong opinion on the various projects that are discussed, you'll have to look somewhere beyond this book. This is not exactly a detraction: McPhee provided a fair amount of evidence to describe each of the projects and the effect on the relevant communities. You can make up your own mind on the value of the engineering efforts, and will have a good starting point if you'd like to go deeper in any of these areas. That said, simply by writing these books McPhee expressed his own opinion on the apparent follies awaiting nature to take its course. As you may have gathered by now, this review has purposefully skirted the actual contents of the book. This is not because there's nothing to discuss, but rather the story is better told by McPhee than me. It's an entertaining book that delivers exactly what I expected from the title and cover. Could it have done more? Sure. Was it worth going through? I think so."

        "text":"Despite the rave reviews, I find this book a little hard to love. This is a collection of three journalistic pieces, covering the stories of how the US Army Corp of Engineers sought to keep the Mississippi river from diverting into another branch and cutting off New Orleans, how Icelandic government stopped a branch of a lava flow from blocking up a harbor, and how the Californian government tried to minimize damages from the unpredictable debris flow coming down from the crumbling San Gabriel mountains. While the topic of the stories are intriguing, and the author did a great job describing all the facets of these complex stories, I found the approach a little \"too broad.\" Sometimes, I get confused by the recurrent episodes of disasters that happened every decade or so, not sure whether I'm reading about an episode that occurred in 1972, or 1913, or 1951. Sometimes, I doubt if it was necessary for me to know the opinion of one particular geology professor, after already hearing the opinion of several others in a row. In the end, I do find it a remarkable feat of journalism to give such a comprehensive coverage to these stories and demonstrate the absurdity and ingenuity of the engineers at the same time. Every time I have a question in my mind, e.g. if they collected all the debris in these dams, what do they do with them? The author already followed up with a segment answering those question, e.g. they broke it down and used it on the beaches or they engineered storms to wash them away. It is a great book for seeing how versatile the New Yorker style of reporting (and writing) can be, how it can effectively tell stories from local cultural events to large, earth-changing cataclysms, while still touching the readers' hearts. But at the same time, for readers who have no specific interst in the topic, this may be just all a little bit too much to digest."

McPhee mixes big-picture exposition with archive material and quotes from personal, on-site interviews, always lively and often playful. Through it all he combines a stunned amazement that we dare even attempt this with some serious respect for the people that do it. Takeaways: 1. Southern Louisiana is actually constitutionally opposed to permanent, earthbound human settlements. The continued existence of New Orleans and Morgan City can be largely attributed to the bloodyminded struggle of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which has been wrestling with the Mississippi River for decades in an effort to prevent it from going where it will, eventually, go. 2. The people of Iceland went to war with a volcano and, acting as foot soldiers for the sea, won. 3. By any traditional reckoning, Los Angeles has clearly been condemned by several deities. I knew wildfires were an issue there, but I didn't realise that a lot of the explosively flammable brush actually renders the ground below a shallow layer hydrophobic, contributing to massive debris flows that attempt to sweep away or at least bury most of the city (which also sits on top of a massive tectonic faultline). You could feel McPhee's jaw dropping as he spoke to people who brushed off the suggestion that their house could quite probably be washed away by gigantic debris swells."

My favorite parts are where McPhee weaves place and people, or people and ideas together and establishes the grand metaphor for his book. McPhee picks up pieces of conversation with geologists and their satelites that might get missed by most other writers, but manages to find, keep and eventually place these nuggets into his book (written over 20 years) in a way that works to support his big themes. Seriously, this book is one of my favorite nonfiction works of all time. You can see the mark McPhee left on his students' writing if you've ever read Robert Wright , Richard Preston or New Yorker editor David Remnick . Some consider McPhee to be the godfather of New New Journalism, but he is much more than that. IMHO, he is the godfather of modern nonfiction writing, period."

In gloomy Victorian halls and on sunny limestone outcrops we tried to get siltstones and schists and garnets to sing to us, to reveal their secrets. Sadly, as in all the sciences, many geologists aren't very good storytellers. That's why we have John McPhee. Through his prose, mountains tell their stories. While the stories collected in Annals of the Former World, don't compare to his masterful The Control of Nature, their still pretty wonderful.

Everest is marine limestone.” My first review will be in Annals and then I will review the rest in the individual books. I may be cheating by doing it this way, but in this reread I have a lot I want to talk about and there are restrictions on characters in these reviews and I am running up against them. I found that out with Annie Dillard’s Pilgrim at Tinker Creek, where I tried to not only immortalize her words, but talk about how they made me feel and think and ran out of room. So, I am rereading the whole canon, Annals of the Former World, but reviewing each book separately, which they are technically separate books, so technically not cheating by claiming each one separately. And I feel that I am writing the way Mr. McPhee writes, in grand sentences, and with grand ideas, and with caveats and humor, and must apologize for the copycatting. I also think that talking, reading, and thinking about geology does this to me. Mr. McPhee is credited with opening a huge new interest in geology in us laypeople. I have to credit it more emphatically to Annie Dillard, who has 2 examples of “big picture” geology and deep time, one like a lyrical waking dream, and the other an artist’s interpretation of time: “Mountains burst up, jutting, and dull and soften before your eyes, clothed in forests like felt. The ice rolls up, grinding green land under water forever; the ice rolls back.\" I have never been the same, always attuned to the geopoetry of this way of looking at the world, and seeing the links between Dillard and McPhee in my worldview. An example of what it does goes like this: I read a sentence such as “There was glaciation in the Southern Hemisphere at the time.” And my mind is blown, why in the Ice Ages was there so little glaciation in the Southern Hemisphere? Antarctica is obviously a fertile field for glaciers, how have I never though of this? Why was there in this period he is talking about? McPhee drops information like this often, and sometimes answers the question I have, sometimes not, this being a throw away sentence, so I have to pause and start googling. What a world we live in, to have this information at our fingertips, literally. This is the type of thinking that makes kids into scientists, so I am first, thrilled I can have that innocence of wonder and awe, and secondly, that also makes poets, and that is why this is such a source of joy for me. ”The poles of the earth have wandered. The equator has apparently moved. The continents, perched on their plates, are thought to have been carried so very far and to be going in so many directions that it seems an act of almost pure hubris to assert that some landmark of our world is fixed at 73 degrees 57 minutes and 53 seconds west longitude and 40 degrees 51 minutes and 14 seconds north latitude—a temporary description, at any rate, as if for a boat on the sea.” This opening is so similar to Annie Dillard’s style that I was hooked from the minute I picked up the 734 page book. I don’t think he is copying her, he just has that sense of what hooks a reader and how to plant a thought that all of us wanderers and armchair wanderers muse about from time to time; where is this place we have been set down? There is a new interactive map ( https:\/\/dinosaurpictures.org\/ancient-... ) that will demonstrate where whatever place you are interested in has been in the past 20 million, 75 million, 400 million, etc. years you are interested in, and it is like McPhee got that in his head from his travels over 20 years with geologists. ” You are in central Nevada, about four hundred miles east of San Francisco, and after you have climbed these mountains you look out upon (as it appears in present theory) open sea. You drop swiftly to the coast, and then move on across moderately profound water full of pelagic squid, water that is quietly accumulating the sediments which—ages in the future—will become the roof rock of the rising Sierra. Tall volcanoes are standing in the sea. Then, at roughly the point where the Sierran foothills will end and the Great Valley will begin—at Auburn, California—you move beyond the shelf and over deep ocean. There are probably some islands out there somewhere, but fundamentally you are crossing above ocean crustal floor that reaches to the China Sea. Below you there is no hint of North America, no hint of the valley or the hills where Sacramento and San Francisco will be.” These passages are one of the main hooks for me, as I travelled across the country several times, only a few by I80 but it is not necessary for the idea, the inspiration. McPhee places the geology in my sense of place and on the land instead of a theoretical or obscure science. I love long distance driving, I love being so close to the land and looking up at the sky; I feel as close to flying on the ground as you can be, and McPhee’s descriptions do nearly the same thing. Land and mountains seem so sure, so permanent, but we know they are not. They become sand. And after that, they sink and are piled upon by sediment to become rock again, and then sand again. So the basic building block of our planet is a grain of sand. Annie Dillard does an thought experiment of looking at a bird, and trying to visualize it becoming defeathered and de-evolved into a lizard and then back again; my favorite is while in a talus filed, or a sand dune field under mountains, to visualize them building up into mountains and then dissolving again in time; and that is why geology is the “music of the earth,” per Hans Cloos. Or as the author describes why he chose I80, it “avoids melodrama, avoids the Grand Canyons, the Jackson Holes, the geologic operas of the country, but it would surely be a sound experience of the big picture, of the history, the construction, the components of the continent. And in all likelihood it would display in its roadcuts rock from every epoch and era.” ”Slowly disassemble the Rocky Mountains and carry the material in small fragments to the Mississippi Delta. The delta builds down. It presses ever deeper on the mantle. Its depth at the moment exceeds twenty-five thousand feet. The heat and the pressure are so great down there that the silt is turning into siltstone, the sand into sandstone, the mud into shale. The Gulf of Mexico was a good example of a geosyncline, with a large part of the Rocky Mountains sitting in it as more than twenty-five thousand feet of silt, sand, and mud, siltstone, sandstone, and shale.” I hiked in the Mount Evans Wilderness recently, along a creek that was carving out the basement rock of the fourteener, and came across a rock outcrop that had an alcove below and a hanging garden above, and it was a wall of the trail, essentially and again, was drawn into a meditation of the mountain crumbling into these giant rocks who live with us for a while and then crumble into smaller stones, and then sand. It is a way of seeing I love. At the same time, beneath my feet, the sand and dirt I walk upon is putting pressure on the detritus of the mountains below us, and rock is being born. McPhee is a translator of sorts, as he says and then alchemizes it: “Geologists, in their all but closed conversation, inhabit scenes that no one ever saw, scenes of global sweep, gone and gone again, including seas, mountains, rivers, forests, and archipelagoes of aching beauty rising in volcanic violence to settle down quietly and then forever disappear—almost disappear.” This book is one of my favorite of the series, and contains the narrative description of what McPhee coined as “deep time.” He writes about the history of geology in an alive, engaging way I wish all historians could try; and as he describes James Hutton, the Scottish father of modern geology, Hutton “had no way of knowing that there were seventy million years just in the line that separated the two kinds of rock, and many millions more in the story of each formation—but he sensed something like it, sensed the awesome truth, and as he stood there staring at the riverbank he was seeing it for all humankind.” If you don’t get chills from that visual, I am sorry. To see something, to sense it, based on your eyes and mind, for all of humankind is a holy moment. “It was at some moment in the Pleistocene that humanity crossed what the geologist-theologian Pierre Teilhard de Chardin called the Threshold of Reflection, when something in people “turned back on itself and so to speak took an infinite leap forward. Outwardly, almost nothing in the organs had changed. But in depth, a great revolution had taken place: consciousness was now leaping and boiling in a space of super-sensory relationships and representations; and simultaneously consciousness was capable of perceiving itself in the concentrated simplicity of its faculties. And all this happened for the first time.” Annie Dillard wrote in 1974 and then in 1990 in more depth, about Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, so I was delighted he is in Basin and Range. Teilhard was a paleontologist, priest and philosopher and my main mantra in life is attributed to him: : \"Throughout my whole life, during every minute of it, the world has been gradually lighting up and blazing before my eyes until it has come to surround me, entirely lit up from within.\" When I read about the Threshold of Reflection, I wished I was there. In my mind, it links to the immortalized footsteps found in Tanzania where Mary Leakey found a trail of hominid footprints, as Dillard writes in For the Time Being: “They walked on moist volcanic tuff and ash. We have a record of those few seconds from a day about 3.6 million years ago—More ash covered the footprints and hardened like plaster. Ash also preserved the pockmarks of the raindrops that fell beside the three who walked: it was a rainy day. We do not know why the woman paused and turned left, briefly, before continuing. “A remote ancestor,” Leakey said, “experienced a moment of doubt.” Possibly they watched the Sadiman volcano erupting, or they took a last look back before they left. We do know we cannot make anything so lasting as these three barefoot ones did.” Perhaps they became conscious of themselves as conscious beings in that moment, meaning, perhaps, we were all there. McPhee writes, “The mind seemed to grow giddy by looking so far into the abyss of time.” Why yes, yes it did, and it still does, maybe always. Some deep time analogies: ”Geologists will sometimes use the calendar year as a unit to represent the time scale, and in such terms the Precambrian runs from New Year’s Day until well after Halloween. Dinosaurs appear in the middle of December and are gone the day after Christmas. The last ice sheet melts on December 31st at one minute before midnight, and the Roman Empire lasts five seconds.” “With your arms spread wide again to represent all time on earth, look at one hand with its line of life. The Cambrian begins in the wrist, and the Permian Extinction is at the outer end of the palm. All of the Cenozoic is in a fingerprint, and in a single stroke with a medium-grained nail file you could eradicate human history.” “The human consciousness may have begun to leap and boil some sunny day in the Pleistocene, but the race by and large has retained the essence of its animal sense of time. People think in five generations—two ahead, two behind—with heavy concentration on the one in the middle. Possibly that is tragic, and possibly there is no choice. The human mind may not have evolved enough to be able to comprehend deep time. It may only be able to measure it.” Going into the deep time meditation a little differently, about the spans of time in either direction, I loved these imageries: “There is no younger rock in the United States than the travertine that is forming in Thermopolis, Wyoming. A 2.7-billion-year-old outcrop of the core of the continent is at the head of Wind River Canyon, twenty miles away.” “And in the deep shadow below the Cambrian were seven years for everyone in all subsequent time. There were four billion years back there—since the earliest beginnings of the world.” “In six thousand years, you could never grow wings on a reptile. With sixty million, however, you could have feathers, too.” “On the geologic time scale, a human lifetime is reduced to a brevity that is too inhibiting to think about. The mind blocks the information. Geologists, dealing always with deep time, find that it seeps into their beings and affects them in various ways: “Mammalian species last, typically, two million years. We’ve about used up ours. Every time Leakey finds something older, I say, ‘Oh! We’re overdue.’ We will be handing the dominant-species-on-earth position to some other group. We’ll have to be clever not to.” “If you free yourself from the conventional reaction to a quantity like a million years, you free yourself a bit from the boundaries of human time. And then in a way you do not live at all, but in another way you live forever.”"

Your road trip will become something entirely different if you can see what you're reading about. #3. Read these books when you're planning a trip to any of the areas discussed. #4. Just read them. John McPhee does connect things better than most writers of text about geology. He makes it accessible while also staying interesting for those \"in the know.\" And the people who are part of the geologic history of a place, like the mappers and surveyers are not mere footnotes in his writing.

        "text":"This book has a rhythm unlike anything else I've read, just like geology has a timescale that takes some time to wrap your head around. It's like an opera. Geology and opera both have a reputation of being long and boring, but they are also majestic and complex. This book is long, but it's not boring! For a while, when I first started this book, my three-year-old wanted me to read every other page to her--the words were like poetry. You can't read it quickly. Reading out loud helped me settle down to the book's pace. There are lots of big words: some of the geology geek persuasion, others of the English major nerd variety...but I wasn't constantly reaching for a dictionary. McPhee throws a new geology term at you, repeats it in multiple contexts so that you get a sense of the thing, and then offers a more complete definition, just in case you still need help. It's engaging. At first I was a little bothered by the lack of photographs of everything. McPhee uses a thousand words to make a picture, but I still wouldn't recognize welded tuff if it was right in front of me. I wanted a modernized, six minute YouTube clip series complete with reality TV interviews with the geologists right at the road cut...I'm not sure I would have savored that as much though. And also, the ideas still get through. I don't want to be a geologist, and I don't need to memorize what all the rocks look like. But I have a much better picture of the complexities of the idea of plate tectonics, what it explains, what it doesn't. And while I'm sure some of the ideas presented in the book are dated, the big picture of geology hasn't changed too much from the public's perspective in the last twenty some-odd years. Each book described some section of geology along Interstate 80, as well as the background of the geologist that McPhee accompanies during that stretch of land. (You really don't have to read the books in order, if you don't want to.) Rising from the Plains was my favorite. The geologist, David Love, had a childhood much like Ralph Moody (who wrote the Little Britches series), and Love's story is woven into the geology of Wyoming beautifully. What an adventure!"

        "text":"This entire book is an artifact from another era, an era when scientific writing for the general reader was undergoing some necessary upgrades. Unfortunately, that is exactly how it reads—as a stylistically interstitial relic. In recent years, science writing has largely eschewed jargon, verbiage, and writerly flourishes—focusing instead on comprehension and simplicity. This book is not simple. It does not eschew verbiage, flourishes, or scientific nomenclature. Furthermore, it is cavalierly uninterested in aiding reader comprehension. After reading 660 pages on the geology of North America, my ignorance of the subject is undiminished. I studied a little geology in college (in Wyoming, no less). I have traveled extensively throughout North America, and the terrain covered in the book (I-80 and environs, principally) is quite familiar to me. Yet I often could not picture in my mind’s eye what McPhee was describing. For whatever reason, this book was published with almost no visual aids. That is inexcusable for a deeply complex book about geology, let alone one ostensibly written for the general reader. Wikipedia entries on lithospheric phenomena are pure pleasure reading by comparison. There were, to be sure, portions of text that were smooth, enlightening, and easy to follow. Such section were rare. Midway through the book, I switched from a paperback to a Kindle version because the ability to look up obscure terms became essential. Why? Because McPhee does nothing whatsoever to ensure the reader understands what he’s talking about. He just throws scientific terms at you as if they are in everyday use and moves on. He says that something “inclines” but doesn’t tell you what he’s referring to, where it is, or what the “incline” is inclined toward. This book (which is really five books in one) has many fans and it has won many prizes. Well done. I found it exhausting."

In an attempt to remedy that, I did some brief research and came up with this book. I got the book for the Geology, I stayed for the writing. This book could be measured in pounds. The premise: seven hundred pages of nonfiction geology in United States. It sounded only slightly drier than dust, and I approached it warily. I was delightfully wrong. John McPhee's craft reminds me most of Steinbeck. (Side note, this may be the nudge up get me to finally read Steinbeck's nonfiction that's been on my shelf for years.) His book is a tapestry of character sketches and history, storytelling and journalism. I wanted to meet old geologists, and drive in a pickup truck across I-80 and drink coffee and look at rocks. Although it's technically scientific journalism, this book moved me like a story. Actually, it had more flavors and savors than much of the fiction I read.

Its a compilation of all of McPhee's writings about American continental Geology. I know, sounds dull, but he uses the lives and characters of the Geologists whose work he is describing along with the massive narrative arc of plate tectonics and the history of the science itself. The story of America's westward expansion along with the Romantic era of northeastern America all seem to blend into a text that can miraculously also explain geomorphology and other remarkably dry topics. Gives the vast expanses of time a tiny human scale which we can then wonder at how our ancestors saw these places as well as the painstaking detective work that was critical to our understanding of how they formed, where these places came from and how in something as seemingly stolid as the ground beneath our feet is a plastic and still changing skin manipulated by forces beyond human comprehension.

        "text":"One of the geologist-contacts of John McPhee explains the impact his professional life has on his perspective: \"You care less about civilization. Half of me gets upset with civilization. The other half does not get upset. I shrug and think, So let the cockroaches take over.\" This, in a nutshell, is the escapism offered by this particular Pulitzer-winning magnum opus. Yeah, that CO2 buildup and our plastic debris will leave a permanent mark, but four billion years of rocks don't care about your pandemic anxiety. The volume is a collection of five books written by McPhee between 1978 and 1999 aimed at describing not only the rock exposed in roadcuts across the United States but also the geologists with whom he traveled. Because I borrowed the e-book from the library, I confess I had no idea I was delving into such a massive volume until I was probably 30 pages in. But at that point, I was hooked. Not that I always knew what McPhee was talking about. There was fatigued rock and incompetent rock and inequigranular fabric in rock. If you bent or folded rock, the inside of the curve was in a state of compression, the outside of the curve was under great tension, and somewhere in the middle was the surface of no strain -- the two sides were active in every fault. The inclination of a slope on which boulders would stay put was the angle of repose. Jargon can be poetic. There were festooned crossbeds and limestone sinks, pillow lavas and petrified trees, incised meanders and defeated streams. There were dike swarms and slickensides, explosion pits, volcanic bombs. Pulsating glaciers. Hogbacks. Radiolarian ooze. And while I probably read the word batholith fifty times without ever bothering to look it up, through all the texture McPhee imparts wonderfully not only five books' worth of geological knowledge, he builds throughout the volume, offering deeper perspectives in the later books. The setup is far from linear. You don't start in the east and end up in California. You jump around. But you do benefit from the fact that in the 20-year period McPhee wrote these books, his understanding of the evolution of the field as the plate tectonics revolution unfolded also grew. Plate tectonics became universally accepted in the '60s, only a few years before the first volume was written. By the '90s, a flourishing of understanding based on technology including isotopes and gravity fields and magnetic fields had brought to light so much more than when he started. One aspect of the writing that makes it come alive is the fact that it's about geologists as much as it's about geology. McPhee describes the geology only in the context of the dedicated men and women who live for the study. \"We are blind men feeling the elephant,\" David Love, of the Geological Survey, has said to me at least fifty times, he writes, referencing the Hindu fable of the blind men touching only one small piece of the creature while trying to infer the whole of it. The foremost problem with the Picture is that ninety-nine per cent of it is missing -- melted or dissolved, torn down, washed away, broken to bits, to become something else in the Picture. The geologist discovers lingering remains, and connects them with dotted lines. Geologists \"try to put the petals back on the flower.\" The ideal scenario for reading this book would be during a cross-country trip across I-80. But absent that real field experience, I found myself pulling up countless YouTube videos to accompany my reading, which enabled me to better visualize a lot of what McPhee describes. Plate tectonics is the star of the show, the framework around which everything else occurs. But the whole of the story is much more complex. Specific geologies are complex and messy. The Appalachians, for example, weren't simply formed the way the Himalayas are today, by two plates violently colliding. They were more the result of a schedule of arrivals of incoming exotic terranes – multiple collisions – over a long spread of time. \"Hotspots\" determine new island arcs and may even help cause continents to split. A thin crust and upraised mantle facilitate basin-and-range formation in Nevada today. Ice sheets set up and started Niagara Falls, moved the Ohio River, dug the Great Lakes. There was continental rifting below Nebraska and Iowa 1.1 billion years ago that stopped before it could turn to ocean. Pokagon State Park, Indiana is made of Canadian rocks, red jasper conglomerates from the north shore of Lake Huron, banded gray gneisses from central Ontario. Boston is African rock and the north of Ireland is American. Some other morsels: In any rock column, more time is missing than present, because erosion is a bigger driving force than orogeny (the building of mountains). And rock columns are more likely to commemorate a moment – a flood, an eruption – than to report a millennium. Like a news broadcast, it is more often a montage of disasters than a cumulative record of time. I visited the Grand Canyon at the age of thirteen. The park is uniquely suited to hitting visitors over the head with what McPhee calls its \"layer-cake\" geology, a gorgeous and linear time scale. But geology is rarely so accommodating. Rock isn't just laid down. It is turned on its side or upside-down. It metamorphosizes and gets moved thousands of miles. It melds with other rocks. The complexity is staggering. The whole Appalachian system continually fed upon itself. There are Precambrian pebbles, in Silurian rock. You'll see Silurian pebbles in Devonian rock, Devonian pebbles in Mississippian rock. Geology repeats itself. Even the wind can play an outsized role in favor of erosion. McPhee describes how a substantial amount of erosion from the Rocky mountains might end up as dust blown by storms into the North Atlantic Ocean. Oil deposits are correlated with conodont fossils of a particular hue. The presence of conodonts in the rock is an indicator of their being the right age, and the color of the fossils is in indication of the level of compression the rocks have undergone, a determinant of oil formation from carbon deposits. California is in large part a collection and compactation of oceanic islands. The \"Smartville arc\" brought gold to California. Toward the end of the middle Jurassic – in the high noon of the dinosaurs, about a hundred and sixty-five million years ago – an island arc like the Aleutians or Japan had moved in from the western ocean and docked here. This was the third terrane at this latitude: the one that followed Sonomia and smashed into it with crumpling, mountain-building effects that propogated eastward turning soils into phyllites, sandstones into quartzites, siltstones into slates – the metamorphics we had seen up the road. In aggregate, the three terranes extended the continent by at least four hundred miles. The third one, suturing here, had doubled the width of what is now California. … If the story of California sounds fantastic, with all its accreting arcs and melanges coming up from the western sea, just look at a map of the southwest Pacific – look at the relationship between Australia and Indonesia right now. [Hot spots] Great Meteor and Cape Verde seem to have lifted New England's high mountains, Bermuda the Smokies. Uplift accelerates erosion. The rock of the Permian period – the last chapter in the Appalachian mountain building story – has been removed everywhere in eastern America except in West Virginia and nearby parts of Ohio and Pennsylvania, halfway between the hot-spot tracks, halfway between New Hampshire and North Carolina. An ophiolite is a section of the Earth's oceanic crust and the underlying upper mantle that has been uplifted and exposed above sea level and often emplaced onto continental crustal rocks. The presence of ophiolites – which we see in California, among other places – is a consequence of continental collisions with oceanic plates. One geologist likened the ophiolite to a cow on a cowcatcher in front of an old western train. The earth as a whole is producing progressively less heat from radioactive decay, and that, at some point, is going to have a profound effect. In the future, the profound effect is going to be that the plates will stop moving. The plate tectonics revolution isn't the only recent revolution in geology. The ability to identify the age of rocks is significantly more advanced than it was in the day when the presence of fossils were the main yardstick. Iron minerals line up like compasses, pointing toward the changing magnetic poles. Isotope decay rates are known and constant. Rock types can be identified by their magnetic signatures. The magnetic field is sampling the shallow crust, the upper few thousand feet. The gravity field is averaging, basically, the whole lithosphere. When you look at a gravity map you are seeing deeper features of the crust. One problem with writing about science is that as any book is written, it immediately is threatened with obsolescence. McPhee observed, The thought occurs to me, not for the first time, that I am following a science as it lurches forward from error to discovery and back to error. But this is actually as much an asset of the writing as it is a detraction. I expect this volume will be worth reading even a hundred years from now because it is not just a textbook. It's written in the form of journeys, set pieces, flashbacks, biographical sketches, and histories of the human and lithic kind . And at the same time, it offers discovery and insight."

For the average joe to pick this up and read through it would be a battle - especially if the subject doesn't interest him. But as Dennis Hopper said to Chris Walken in True Romance \"this shit fascinates me.\" Different subject matter - same principle. I've always liked rocks and the thought of what went on before we got here - why things are the way they are - and what is going to continue long after we are gone has a certain appeal. There's a certain comfort that comes in reading about something that doesn't give a shit about the Dow Jones, ISIS, Obama, American Idol and the Superbowl. It's a planet doing it's thing and there's nothing you can do to stop it. It's not a predictive science. The geologic history in this book is interwoven with man's history in this country as it relates to the areas across a specific latitude of the US. Though there is a lot of rocks to wade through I really enjoyed the book. I probably didn't absorb much of the various delineations of geologic time aside from Precambrian and everything that came after - but in context to how long people have been around - it really puts things in perspective. The the history of earth were the length of \"Stairway to Heaven\" we would be part of of one of the syllables of Plant's last utterance of the word Heaven as the song ends - maybe not even that much. There were some very eye opening things that I never knew about as well as far as how North America came together. I was always under the impression that we just sort of floated away from Pangeia or the first continent and that was it - apparently not. The chapter on California was really interesting as well regarding faults and earthquakes, the gold rush, etc. It was just a really cool book if you like earth sciences.

I really enjoyed the science and the storytelling, but the book often spent too much time using words it hadn't defined and too little time telling stories about processes. My favorite parts were the vignettes connecting geology to history - the gold miners in the Sierra Nevadas, the cowboys in Wyoming, even the vacationers in the Delaware Water Gap. (I was disappointed that this vignette was missing from the final \"book,\" Crossing the Craton .) Each book also introduced a new geological phenomenon, which were the parts I suspect I'll remember best. Other parts were tougher to finish. I often struggled to follow the long passages describing how specific geographical places came to be - describing rocks being shoved up, eroding, being covered, flipping, and deformed by other rocks. I get that this is how geology works, but it doesn't always translate to the written page. Also, as I said in my review for \"Assembling California,\" I'd love to see more pictures and maps. However, for all my complaints, I am now a geology fan and have a much deeper appreciation for the earth around me. I'd guess that's what John McPhee would have wanted me to get out of it."

Einzige Warnung: Der Autor schreibt auf hohem Niveau, und ohne viele geologische Fachbegriffe geht es nicht. Da gibt es für mich noch sehr viel zu lernen."

        "text":"Remember driving along a highway and passing through a road cut where the layers of stone in the hillside rise and descend as you pass. John McPhee began to wonder about these roadcuts and over several years compiled a geologic history of the United States through interviews and feild trips with geology professors from New York to San Francisco. His epic adventure immerses readers in deep deep time, a complex poetry of terminology, and a fascinating array of personal stories. He continually reconnects the geology of the narrative to the reader through frequent references to history and periodic sprinklings of wry humor. And it's not all geology; You'll be amazed by Geologist David Love's family history and thrilled and appalled at the rapid-fire recounts of experiences of the Loma Prieta earthquake of 1988, when slabs of double-decker highway dropped onto commuter vehicles and Candlestick Park shook duriing the world Series. This is not a strictly layman's book. The language is dense, the concepts unfamiliar, and the few illustrations, diagrams and maps insufficient to clarify much of the text. However, McPhee possesses the sensibilities of both journalist and poet. While the reader may have to soldier through ignornance and inexperience at times, the 660 page journey creates a satisfying understanding of the precepts and questions posed by geologists and geology and a grounding sense of the theory of geological time and the formation of the surface of our planet. Overall, it makes me feel small and ephemeral."

        "text":"The expression \"it's written in stone\" couldn't be more true than the story told in this magnificent tale of one writer's journey across a continent in the company of some of the world's leading geologists. Mr. McPhee isn't afraid of using the correct scientific terminology, isn't worried that the verbiage might be over the heads of many readers. The result is a satisfying read that doesn't insult the intelligence of the reader because, above all else, his writing style is both informative AND entertaining, without any need to \"dumb it down\" into monosyllabic pap. The story unfolds kaleidoscopically, beginning in New Jersey, then away to the West along Highway 81, through many unlikely times and places such as an old silent-era Mack Sennett movie, Butch Cassidy's Hole-In-The-Wall gang and a world series baseball game interrupted by a devastating earthquake, and even a multi-million-dollar silver find in what was suppoed to be an exhausted tailings pile. From the professor of geology trying to inspire fresh new minds in the classroom to the weekend rock hound, to the armchair surfer just looking for a thick and well written tome to help pass rainy days, this book is an excellent choice."

        "text":"An accomplishment of a scale commensurate with that of geological time, this popular science opus takes the reader across the entire breadth of North America. From the San Andreas Fault to the ancient rift valleys of New Jersey, over basin and range, synclines and sediments, and across the remnants of continental ice sheets and Rocky Mountain orogenies, McPhee weaves together the geologic history of the United States. Composed of five books, each tackling a discrete piece of time and space, this anthology crisscrosses the continent and in the process elucidates not just the distant past, but also the rich characters who are now piecing together its story. Impeccably researched, written in a style that is precise without being overly technical, and with just the right ratio of humor to gravitas, McPhee’s prose shines. This is one heck of a book. Edit: I reread this book, this time in geographic order from west to east, before and during my trip from California back to Iowa. I liked it just as much, maybe even more."

I'd always thought geology was \"just rocks\" until I read this. But McPhee takes you into the lives of his geologist guides, teaches you about the big breakthroughs in the science, and takes you through some geological events, some slow (like orogeny, one of my new favorite words) and some fast (the Loma Prieta earthquake). You learn a lot, but there are poetical passages in which he just lets the luscious, metaphorical terminology of the science wash over you; don't try to understand every paragraph word-for-word. This is broken into five sections, four of which were previously published separately. One can read a section on its own, take a break, and then come back to this huge tome."

My favorite parts are where McPhee weaves place and people, or people and ideas together and establishes the grand metaphor for his book. McPhee picks up pieces of conversation with geologists and their satelites that might get missed by most other writers, but manages to find, keep and eventually place these nuggets into his book (written over 20 years) in a way that works to support his big themes. Seriously, this book is one of my favorite nonfiction works of all time. You can see the mark McPhee left on his students' writing if you've ever read Robert Wright , Richard Preston or New Yorker editor David Remnick . Some consider McPhee to be the godfather of New New Journalism, but he is much more than that. IMHO, he is the godfather of modern nonfiction writing, period."

In gloomy Victorian halls and on sunny limestone outcrops we tried to get siltstones and schists and garnets to sing to us, to reveal their secrets. Sadly, as in all the sciences, many geologists aren't very good storytellers. That's why we have John McPhee. Through his prose, mountains tell their stories.

Everest is marine limestone.” My first review will be in Annals and then I will review the rest in the individual books. I may be cheating by doing it this way, but in this reread I have a lot I want to talk about and there are restrictions on characters in these reviews and I am running up against them. I found that out with Annie Dillard’s Pilgrim at Tinker Creek, where I tried to not only immortalize her words, but talk about how they made me feel and think and ran out of room. So, I am rereading the whole canon, Annals of the Former World, but reviewing each book separately, which they are technically separate books, so technically not cheating by claiming each one separately. And I feel that I am writing the way Mr. McPhee writes, in grand sentences, and with grand ideas, and with caveats and humor, and must apologize for the copycatting. I also think that talking, reading, and thinking about geology does this to me. Mr. McPhee is credited with opening a huge new interest in geology in us laypeople. I have to credit it more emphatically to Annie Dillard, who has 2 examples of “big picture” geology and deep time, one like a lyrical waking dream, and the other an artist’s interpretation of time: “Mountains burst up, jutting, and dull and soften before your eyes, clothed in forests like felt. The ice rolls up, grinding green land under water forever; the ice rolls back.\" I have never been the same, always attuned to the geopoetry of this way of looking at the world, and seeing the links between Dillard and McPhee in my worldview. An example of what it does goes like this: I read a sentence such as “There was glaciation in the Southern Hemisphere at the time.” And my mind is blown, why in the Ice Ages was there so little glaciation in the Southern Hemisphere? Antarctica is obviously a fertile field for glaciers, how have I never though of this? Why was there in this period he is talking about? McPhee drops information like this often, and sometimes answers the question I have, sometimes not, this being a throw away sentence, so I have to pause and start googling. What a world we live in, to have this information at our fingertips, literally. This is the type of thinking that makes kids into scientists, so I am first, thrilled I can have that innocence of wonder and awe, and secondly, that also makes poets, and that is why this is such a source of joy for me. ”The poles of the earth have wandered. The equator has apparently moved. The continents, perched on their plates, are thought to have been carried so very far and to be going in so many directions that it seems an act of almost pure hubris to assert that some landmark of our world is fixed at 73 degrees 57 minutes and 53 seconds west longitude and 40 degrees 51 minutes and 14 seconds north latitude—a temporary description, at any rate, as if for a boat on the sea.” This opening is so similar to Annie Dillard’s style that I was hooked from the minute I picked up the 734 page book. I don’t think he is copying her, he just has that sense of what hooks a reader and how to plant a thought that all of us wanderers and armchair wanderers muse about from time to time; where is this place we have been set down? There is a new interactive map ( https:\/\/dinosaurpictures.org\/ancient-... ) that will demonstrate where whatever place you are interested in has been in the past 20 million, 75 million, 400 million, etc. years you are interested in, and it is like McPhee got that in his head from his travels over 20 years with geologists. ” You are in central Nevada, about four hundred miles east of San Francisco, and after you have climbed these mountains you look out upon (as it appears in present theory) open sea. You drop swiftly to the coast, and then move on across moderately profound water full of pelagic squid, water that is quietly accumulating the sediments which—ages in the future—will become the roof rock of the rising Sierra. Tall volcanoes are standing in the sea. Then, at roughly the point where the Sierran foothills will end and the Great Valley will begin—at Auburn, California—you move beyond the shelf and over deep ocean. There are probably some islands out there somewhere, but fundamentally you are crossing above ocean crustal floor that reaches to the China Sea. Below you there is no hint of North America, no hint of the valley or the hills where Sacramento and San Francisco will be.” These passages are one of the main hooks for me, as I travelled across the country several times, only a few by I80 but it is not necessary for the idea, the inspiration. McPhee places the geology in my sense of place and on the land instead of a theoretical or obscure science. I love long distance driving, I love being so close to the land and looking up at the sky; I feel as close to flying on the ground as you can be, and McPhee’s descriptions do nearly the same thing. Land and mountains seem so sure, so permanent, but we know they are not. They become sand. And after that, they sink and are piled upon by sediment to become rock again, and then sand again. So the basic building block of our planet is a grain of sand. Annie Dillard does an thought experiment of looking at a bird, and trying to visualize it becoming defeathered and de-evolved into a lizard and then back again; my favorite is while in a talus filed, or a sand dune field under mountains, to visualize them building up into mountains and then dissolving again in time; and that is why geology is the “music of the earth,” per Hans Cloos. Or as the author describes why he chose I80, it “avoids melodrama, avoids the Grand Canyons, the Jackson Holes, the geologic operas of the country, but it would surely be a sound experience of the big picture, of the history, the construction, the components of the continent. And in all likelihood it would display in its roadcuts rock from every epoch and era.” ”Slowly disassemble the Rocky Mountains and carry the material in small fragments to the Mississippi Delta. The delta builds down. It presses ever deeper on the mantle. Its depth at the moment exceeds twenty-five thousand feet. The heat and the pressure are so great down there that the silt is turning into siltstone, the sand into sandstone, the mud into shale. The Gulf of Mexico was a good example of a geosyncline, with a large part of the Rocky Mountains sitting in it as more than twenty-five thousand feet of silt, sand, and mud, siltstone, sandstone, and shale.” I hiked in the Mount Evans Wilderness recently, along a creek that was carving out the basement rock of the fourteener, and came across a rock outcrop that had an alcove below and a hanging garden above, and it was a wall of the trail, essentially and again, was drawn into a meditation of the mountain crumbling into these giant rocks who live with us for a while and then crumble into smaller stones, and then sand. It is a way of seeing I love. At the same time, beneath my feet, the sand and dirt I walk upon is putting pressure on the detritus of the mountains below us, and rock is being born. McPhee is a translator of sorts, as he says and then alchemizes it: “Geologists, in their all but closed conversation, inhabit scenes that no one ever saw, scenes of global sweep, gone and gone again, including seas, mountains, rivers, forests, and archipelagoes of aching beauty rising in volcanic violence to settle down quietly and then forever disappear—almost disappear.” This book is one of my favorite of the series, and contains the narrative description of what McPhee coined as “deep time.” He writes about the history of geology in an alive, engaging way I wish all historians could try; and as he describes James Hutton, the Scottish father of modern geology, Hutton “had no way of knowing that there were seventy million years just in the line that separated the two kinds of rock, and many millions more in the story of each formation—but he sensed something like it, sensed the awesome truth, and as he stood there staring at the riverbank he was seeing it for all humankind.” If you don’t get chills from that visual, I am sorry. To see something, to sense it, based on your eyes and mind, for all of humankind is a holy moment. “It was at some moment in the Pleistocene that humanity crossed what the geologist-theologian Pierre Teilhard de Chardin called the Threshold of Reflection, when something in people “turned back on itself and so to speak took an infinite leap forward. Outwardly, almost nothing in the organs had changed. But in depth, a great revolution had taken place: consciousness was now leaping and boiling in a space of super-sensory relationships and representations; and simultaneously consciousness was capable of perceiving itself in the concentrated simplicity of its faculties. And all this happened for the first time.” Annie Dillard wrote in 1974 and then in 1990 in more depth, about Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, so I was delighted he is in Basin and Range. Teilhard was a paleontologist, priest and philosopher and my main mantra in life is attributed to him: : \"Throughout my whole life, during every minute of it, the world has been gradually lighting up and blazing before my eyes until it has come to surround me, entirely lit up from within.\" When I read about the Threshold of Reflection, I wished I was there. In my mind, it links to the immortalized footsteps found in Tanzania where Mary Leakey found a trail of hominid footprints, as Dillard writes in For the Time Being: “They walked on moist volcanic tuff and ash. We have a record of those few seconds from a day about 3.6 million years ago—More ash covered the footprints and hardened like plaster. Ash also preserved the pockmarks of the raindrops that fell beside the three who walked: it was a rainy day. We do not know why the woman paused and turned left, briefly, before continuing. “A remote ancestor,” Leakey said, “experienced a moment of doubt.” Possibly they watched the Sadiman volcano erupting, or they took a last look back before they left. We do know we cannot make anything so lasting as these three barefoot ones did.” Perhaps they became conscious of themselves as conscious beings in that moment, meaning, perhaps, we were all there. McPhee writes, “The mind seemed to grow giddy by looking so far into the abyss of time.” Why yes, yes it did, and it still does, maybe always. Some deep time analogies: ”Geologists will sometimes use the calendar year as a unit to represent the time scale, and in such terms the Precambrian runs from New Year’s Day until well after Halloween. Dinosaurs appear in the middle of December and are gone the day after Christmas. The last ice sheet melts on December 31st at one minute before midnight, and the Roman Empire lasts five seconds.” “With your arms spread wide again to represent all time on earth, look at one hand with its line of life. The Cambrian begins in the wrist, and the Permian Extinction is at the outer end of the palm. All of the Cenozoic is in a fingerprint, and in a single stroke with a medium-grained nail file you could eradicate human history.” “The human consciousness may have begun to leap and boil some sunny day in the Pleistocene, but the race by and large has retained the essence of its animal sense of time. People think in five generations—two ahead, two behind—with heavy concentration on the one in the middle. Possibly that is tragic, and possibly there is no choice. The human mind may not have evolved enough to be able to comprehend deep time. It may only be able to measure it.” Going into the deep time meditation a little differently, about the spans of time in either direction, I loved these imageries: “There is no younger rock in the United States than the travertine that is forming in Thermopolis, Wyoming. A 2.7-billion-year-old outcrop of the core of the continent is at the head of Wind River Canyon, twenty miles away.” “And in the deep shadow below the Cambrian were seven years for everyone in all subsequent time. There were four billion years back there—since the earliest beginnings of the world.” “In six thousand years, you could never grow wings on a reptile. With sixty million, however, you could have feathers, too.” “On the geologic time scale, a human lifetime is reduced to a brevity that is too inhibiting to think about. The mind blocks the information. Geologists, dealing always with deep time, find that it seeps into their beings and affects them in various ways: “Mammalian species last, typically, two million years. We’ve about used up ours. Every time Leakey finds something older, I say, ‘Oh! We’re overdue.’ We will be handing the dominant-species-on-earth position to some other group. We’ll have to be clever not to.” “If you free yourself from the conventional reaction to a quantity like a million years, you free yourself a bit from the boundaries of human time. And then in a way you do not live at all, but in another way you live forever.”"

Geology and opera both have a reputation of being long and boring, but they are also majestic and complex. This book is long, but it's not boring! For a while, when I first started this book, my three-year-old wanted me to read every other page to her--the words were like poetry. You can't read it quickly. Reading out loud helped me settle down to the book's pace. There are lots of big words: some of the geology geek persuasion, others of the English major nerd variety...but I wasn't constantly reaching for a dictionary. McPhee throws a new geology term at you, repeats it in multiple contexts so that you get a sense of the thing, and then offers a more complete definition, just in case you still need help. It's engaging. At first I was a little bothered by the lack of photographs of everything. McPhee uses a thousand words to make a picture, but I still wouldn't recognize welded tuff if it was right in front of me. I wanted a modernized, six minute YouTube clip series complete with reality TV interviews with the geologists right at the road cut...I'm not sure I would have savored that as much though. And also, the ideas still get through. I don't want to be a geologist, and I don't need to memorize what all the rocks look like. But I have a much better picture of the complexities of the idea of plate tectonics, what it explains, what it doesn't. And while I'm sure some of the ideas presented in the book are dated, the big picture of geology hasn't changed too much from the public's perspective in the last twenty some-odd years. Each book described some section of geology along Interstate 80, as well as the background of the geologist that McPhee accompanies during that stretch of land. (You really don't have to read the books in order, if you don't want to.) Rising from the Plains was my favorite. The geologist, David Love, had a childhood much like Ralph Moody (who wrote the Little Britches series), and Love's story is woven into the geology of Wyoming beautifully. What an adventure!"

Unfortunately, that is exactly how it reads—as a stylistically interstitial relic. In recent years, science writing has largely eschewed jargon, verbiage, and writerly flourishes—focusing instead on comprehension and simplicity. This book is not simple. It does not eschew verbiage, flourishes, or scientific nomenclature. Furthermore, it is cavalierly uninterested in aiding reader comprehension. After reading 660 pages on the geology of North America, my ignorance of the subject is undiminished. I studied a little geology in college (in Wyoming, no less). I have traveled extensively throughout North America, and the terrain covered in the book (I-80 and environs, principally) is quite familiar to me. Yet I often could not picture in my mind’s eye what McPhee was describing. For whatever reason, this book was published with almost no visual aids. That is inexcusable for a deeply complex book about geology, let alone one ostensibly written for the general reader. Wikipedia entries on lithospheric phenomena are pure pleasure reading by comparison. There were, to be sure, portions of text that were smooth, enlightening, and easy to follow. Such section were rare. Midway through the book, I switched from a paperback to a Kindle version because the ability to look up obscure terms became essential. Why? Because McPhee does nothing whatsoever to ensure the reader understands what he’s talking about. He just throws scientific terms at you as if they are in everyday use and moves on. He says that something “inclines” but doesn’t tell you what he’s referring to, where it is, or what the “incline” is inclined toward. This book (which is really five books in one) has many fans and it has won many prizes. Well done. I found it exhausting."

The premise: seven hundred pages of nonfiction geology in United States. It sounded only slightly drier than dust, and I approached it warily. I was delightfully wrong. John McPhee's craft reminds me most of Steinbeck. (Side note, this may be the nudge up get me to finally read Steinbeck's nonfiction that's been on my shelf for years.) His book is a tapestry of character sketches and history, storytelling and journalism. I wanted to meet old geologists, and drive in a pickup truck across I-80 and drink coffee and look at rocks. Although it's technically scientific journalism, this book moved me like a story. Actually, it had more flavors and savors than much of the fiction I read.

The story of America's westward expansion along with the Romantic era of northeastern America all seem to blend into a text that can miraculously also explain geomorphology and other remarkably dry topics. Gives the vast expanses of time a tiny human scale which we can then wonder at how our ancestors saw these places as well as the painstaking detective work that was critical to our understanding of how they formed, where these places came from and how in something as seemingly stolid as the ground beneath our feet is a plastic and still changing skin manipulated by forces beyond human comprehension.

It is not a casual read, but for anyone interesting in geology is it worth the effort and somehow explains the principles of plate tectonics (and other things) without being overly technical. It also touches on the history of a few areas of the U.S., which at times got tedious, and the many \"stories within the story\" distracted from the geology. This would not be altogether bad if one were more interested in history and biographies than in rocks, but I preferred the rocks. In short, it is a long, sometimes rambling, but completely worthwhile book."

        "text":"One of the geologist-contacts of John McPhee explains the impact his professional life has on his perspective: \"You care less about civilization. Half of me gets upset with civilization. The other half does not get upset. I shrug and think, So let the cockroaches take over.\" This, in a nutshell, is the escapism offered by this particular Pulitzer-winning magnum opus. Yeah, that CO2 buildup and our plastic debris will leave a permanent mark, but four billion years of rocks don't care about your pandemic anxiety. The volume is a collection of five books written by McPhee between 1978 and 1999 aimed at describing not only the rock exposed in roadcuts across the United States but also the geologists with whom he traveled. Because I borrowed the e-book from the library, I confess I had no idea I was delving into such a massive volume until I was probably 30 pages in. But at that point, I was hooked. Not that I always knew what McPhee was talking about. There was fatigued rock and incompetent rock and inequigranular fabric in rock. If you bent or folded rock, the inside of the curve was in a state of compression, the outside of the curve was under great tension, and somewhere in the middle was the surface of no strain -- the two sides were active in every fault. The inclination of a slope on which boulders would stay put was the angle of repose. Jargon can be poetic. There were festooned crossbeds and limestone sinks, pillow lavas and petrified trees, incised meanders and defeated streams. There were dike swarms and slickensides, explosion pits, volcanic bombs. Pulsating glaciers. Hogbacks. Radiolarian ooze. And while I probably read the word batholith fifty times without ever bothering to look it up, through all the texture McPhee imparts wonderfully not only five books' worth of geological knowledge, he builds throughout the volume, offering deeper perspectives in the later books. The setup is far from linear. You don't start in the east and end up in California. You jump around. But you do benefit from the fact that in the 20-year period McPhee wrote these books, his understanding of the evolution of the field as the plate tectonics revolution unfolded also grew. Plate tectonics became universally accepted in the '60s, only a few years before the first volume was written. By the '90s, a flourishing of understanding based on technology including isotopes and gravity fields and magnetic fields had brought to light so much more than when he started. One aspect of the writing that makes it come alive is the fact that it's about geologists as much as it's about geology. McPhee describes the geology only in the context of the dedicated men and women who live for the study. \"We are blind men feeling the elephant,\" David Love, of the Geological Survey, has said to me at least fifty times, he writes, referencing the Hindu fable of the blind men touching only one small piece of the creature while trying to infer the whole of it. The foremost problem with the Picture is that ninety-nine per cent of it is missing -- melted or dissolved, torn down, washed away, broken to bits, to become something else in the Picture. The geologist discovers lingering remains, and connects them with dotted lines. Geologists \"try to put the petals back on the flower.\" The ideal scenario for reading this book would be during a cross-country trip across I-80. But absent that real field experience, I found myself pulling up countless YouTube videos to accompany my reading, which enabled me to better visualize a lot of what McPhee describes. Plate tectonics is the star of the show, the framework around which everything else occurs. But the whole of the story is much more complex. Specific geologies are complex and messy. The Appalachians, for example, weren't simply formed the way the Himalayas are today, by two plates violently colliding. They were more the result of a schedule of arrivals of incoming exotic terranes – multiple collisions – over a long spread of time. \"Hotspots\" determine new island arcs and may even help cause continents to split. A thin crust and upraised mantle facilitate basin-and-range formation in Nevada today. Ice sheets set up and started Niagara Falls, moved the Ohio River, dug the Great Lakes. There was continental rifting below Nebraska and Iowa 1.1 billion years ago that stopped before it could turn to ocean. Pokagon State Park, Indiana is made of Canadian rocks, red jasper conglomerates from the north shore of Lake Huron, banded gray gneisses from central Ontario. Boston is African rock and the north of Ireland is American. Some other morsels: In any rock column, more time is missing than present, because erosion is a bigger driving force than orogeny (the building of mountains). And rock columns are more likely to commemorate a moment – a flood, an eruption – than to report a millennium. Like a news broadcast, it is more often a montage of disasters than a cumulative record of time. I visited the Grand Canyon at the age of thirteen. The park is uniquely suited to hitting visitors over the head with what McPhee calls its \"layer-cake\" geology, a gorgeous and linear time scale. But geology is rarely so accommodating. Rock isn't just laid down. It is turned on its side or upside-down. It metamorphosizes and gets moved thousands of miles. It melds with other rocks. The complexity is staggering. The whole Appalachian system continually fed upon itself. There are Precambrian pebbles, in Silurian rock. You'll see Silurian pebbles in Devonian rock, Devonian pebbles in Mississippian rock. Geology repeats itself. Even the wind can play an outsized role in favor of erosion. McPhee describes how a substantial amount of erosion from the Rocky mountains might end up as dust blown by storms into the North Atlantic Ocean. Oil deposits are correlated with conodont fossils of a particular hue. The presence of conodonts in the rock is an indicator of their being the right age, and the color of the fossils is in indication of the level of compression the rocks have undergone, a determinant of oil formation from carbon deposits. California is in large part a collection and compactation of oceanic islands. The \"Smartville arc\" brought gold to California. Toward the end of the middle Jurassic – in the high noon of the dinosaurs, about a hundred and sixty-five million years ago – an island arc like the Aleutians or Japan had moved in from the western ocean and docked here. This was the third terrane at this latitude: the one that followed Sonomia and smashed into it with crumpling, mountain-building effects that propogated eastward turning soils into phyllites, sandstones into quartzites, siltstones into slates – the metamorphics we had seen up the road. In aggregate, the three terranes extended the continent by at least four hundred miles. The third one, suturing here, had doubled the width of what is now California. … If the story of California sounds fantastic, with all its accreting arcs and melanges coming up from the western sea, just look at a map of the southwest Pacific – look at the relationship between Australia and Indonesia right now. [Hot spots] Great Meteor and Cape Verde seem to have lifted New England's high mountains, Bermuda the Smokies. Uplift accelerates erosion. The rock of the Permian period – the last chapter in the Appalachian mountain building story – has been removed everywhere in eastern America except in West Virginia and nearby parts of Ohio and Pennsylvania, halfway between the hot-spot tracks, halfway between New Hampshire and North Carolina. An ophiolite is a section of the Earth's oceanic crust and the underlying upper mantle that has been uplifted and exposed above sea level and often emplaced onto continental crustal rocks. The presence of ophiolites – which we see in California, among other places – is a consequence of continental collisions with oceanic plates. One geologist likened the ophiolite to a cow on a cowcatcher in front of an old western train. The earth as a whole is producing progressively less heat from radioactive decay, and that, at some point, is going to have a profound effect. In the future, the profound effect is going to be that the plates will stop moving. The plate tectonics revolution isn't the only recent revolution in geology. The ability to identify the age of rocks is significantly more advanced than it was in the day when the presence of fossils were the main yardstick. Iron minerals line up like compasses, pointing toward the changing magnetic poles. Isotope decay rates are known and constant. Rock types can be identified by their magnetic signatures. The magnetic field is sampling the shallow crust, the upper few thousand feet. The gravity field is averaging, basically, the whole lithosphere. When you look at a gravity map you are seeing deeper features of the crust. One problem with writing about science is that as any book is written, it immediately is threatened with obsolescence. McPhee observed, The thought occurs to me, not for the first time, that I am following a science as it lurches forward from error to discovery and back to error. But this is actually as much an asset of the writing as it is a detraction. I expect this volume will be worth reading even a hundred years from now because it is not just a textbook. It's written in the form of journeys, set pieces, flashbacks, biographical sketches, and histories of the human and lithic kind . And at the same time, it offers discovery and insight."

For the average joe to pick this up and read through it would be a battle - especially if the subject doesn't interest him. But as Dennis Hopper said to Chris Walken in True Romance \"this shit fascinates me.\" Different subject matter - same principle. I've always liked rocks and the thought of what went on before we got here - why things are the way they are - and what is going to continue long after we are gone has a certain appeal. There's a certain comfort that comes in reading about something that doesn't give a shit about the Dow Jones, ISIS, Obama, American Idol and the Superbowl. It's a planet doing it's thing and there's nothing you can do to stop it. It's not a predictive science. The geologic history in this book is interwoven with man's history in this country as it relates to the areas across a specific latitude of the US. Though there is a lot of rocks to wade through I really enjoyed the book. I probably didn't absorb much of the various delineations of geologic time aside from Precambrian and everything that came after - but in context to how long people have been around - it really puts things in perspective. The the history of earth were the length of \"Stairway to Heaven\" we would be part of of one of the syllables of Plant's last utterance of the word Heaven as the song ends - maybe not even that much. There were some very eye opening things that I never knew about as well as far as how North America came together. I was always under the impression that we just sort of floated away from Pangeia or the first continent and that was it - apparently not. The chapter on California was really interesting as well regarding faults and earthquakes, the gold rush, etc. It was just a really cool book if you like earth sciences. If you don't? stick with a novel because this will be some work for you."

I really enjoyed the science and the storytelling, but the book often spent too much time using words it hadn't defined and too little time telling stories about processes. My favorite parts were the vignettes connecting geology to history - the gold miners in the Sierra Nevadas, the cowboys in Wyoming, even the vacationers in the Delaware Water Gap. (I was disappointed that this vignette was missing from the final \"book,\" Crossing the Craton .) Each book also introduced a new geological phenomenon, which were the parts I suspect I'll remember best. Other parts were tougher to finish. I often struggled to follow the long passages describing how specific geographical places came to be - describing rocks being shoved up, eroding, being covered, flipping, and deformed by other rocks. I get that this is how geology works, but it doesn't always translate to the written page. Also, as I said in my review for \"Assembling California,\" I'd love to see more pictures and maps. However, for all my complaints, I am now a geology fan and have a much deeper appreciation for the earth around me. I'd guess that's what John McPhee would have wanted me to get out of it."

John McPhee began to wonder about these roadcuts and over several years compiled a geologic history of the United States through interviews and feild trips with geology professors from New York to San Francisco. His epic adventure immerses readers in deep deep time, a complex poetry of terminology, and a fascinating array of personal stories. He continually reconnects the geology of the narrative to the reader through frequent references to history and periodic sprinklings of wry humor. And it's not all geology; You'll be amazed by Geologist David Love's family history and thrilled and appalled at the rapid-fire recounts of experiences of the Loma Prieta earthquake of 1988, when slabs of double-decker highway dropped onto commuter vehicles and Candlestick Park shook duriing the world Series. This is not a strictly layman's book. The language is dense, the concepts unfamiliar, and the few illustrations, diagrams and maps insufficient to clarify much of the text. However, McPhee possesses the sensibilities of both journalist and poet. While the reader may have to soldier through ignornance and inexperience at times, the 660 page journey creates a satisfying understanding of the precepts and questions posed by geologists and geology and a grounding sense of the theory of geological time and the formation of the surface of our planet. Overall, it makes me feel small and ephemeral."

But McPhee takes you into the lives of his geologist guides, teaches you about the big breakthroughs in the science, and takes you through some geological events, some slow (like orogeny, one of my new favorite words) and some fast (the Loma Prieta earthquake). You learn a lot, but there are poetical passages in which he just lets the luscious, metaphorical terminology of the science wash over you; don't try to understand every paragraph word-for-word.

Everest is marine limestone.” My first review will be in Annals and then I will review the rest in the individual books. I may be cheating by doing it this way, but in this reread I have a lot I want to talk about and there are restrictions on characters in these reviews and I am running up against them. I found that out with Annie Dillard’s Pilgrim at Tinker Creek, where I tried to not only immortalize her words, but talk about how they made me feel and think and ran out of room. So, I am rereading the whole canon, Annals of the Former World, but reviewing each book separately, which they are technically separate books, so technically not cheating by claiming each one separately. And I feel that I am writing the way Mr. McPhee writes, in grand sentences, and with grand ideas, and with caveats and humor, and must apologize for the copycatting. I also think that talking, reading, and thinking about geology does this to me. Mr. McPhee is credited with opening a huge new interest in geology in us laypeople. I have to credit it more emphatically to Annie Dillard, who has 2 examples of “big picture” geology and deep time, one like a lyrical waking dream, and the other an artist’s interpretation of time: “Mountains burst up, jutting, and dull and soften before your eyes, clothed in forests like felt. The ice rolls up, grinding green land under water forever; the ice rolls back.\" I have never been the same, always attuned to the geopoetry of this way of looking at the world, and seeing the links between Dillard and McPhee in my worldview. An example of what it does goes like this: I read a sentence such as “There was glaciation in the Southern Hemisphere at the time.” And my mind is blown, why in the Ice Ages was there so little glaciation in the Southern Hemisphere? Antarctica is obviously a fertile field for glaciers, how have I never though of this? Why was there in this period he is talking about? McPhee drops information like this often, and sometimes answers the question I have, sometimes not, this being a throw away sentence, so I have to pause and start googling. What a world we live in, to have this information at our fingertips, literally. This is the type of thinking that makes kids into scientists, so I am first, thrilled I can have that innocence of wonder and awe, and secondly, that also makes poets, and that is why this is such a source of joy for me. ”The poles of the earth have wandered. The equator has apparently moved. The continents, perched on their plates, are thought to have been carried so very far and to be going in so many directions that it seems an act of almost pure hubris to assert that some landmark of our world is fixed at 73 degrees 57 minutes and 53 seconds west longitude and 40 degrees 51 minutes and 14 seconds north latitude—a temporary description, at any rate, as if for a boat on the sea.” This opening is so similar to Annie Dillard’s style that I was hooked from the minute I picked up the 734 page book. I don’t think he is copying her, he just has that sense of what hooks a reader and how to plant a thought that all of us wanderers and armchair wanderers muse about from time to time; where is this place we have been set down? There is a new interactive map ( https:\/\/dinosaurpictures.org\/ancient-... ) that will demonstrate where whatever place you are interested in has been in the past 20 million, 75 million, 400 million, etc. years you are interested in, and it is like McPhee got that in his head from his travels over 20 years with geologists. ” You are in central Nevada, about four hundred miles east of San Francisco, and after you have climbed these mountains you look out upon (as it appears in present theory) open sea. You drop swiftly to the coast, and then move on across moderately profound water full of pelagic squid, water that is quietly accumulating the sediments which—ages in the future—will become the roof rock of the rising Sierra. Tall volcanoes are standing in the sea. Then, at roughly the point where the Sierran foothills will end and the Great Valley will begin—at Auburn, California—you move beyond the shelf and over deep ocean. There are probably some islands out there somewhere, but fundamentally you are crossing above ocean crustal floor that reaches to the China Sea. Below you there is no hint of North America, no hint of the valley or the hills where Sacramento and San Francisco will be.” These passages are one of the main hooks for me, as I travelled across the country several times, only a few by I80 but it is not necessary for the idea, the inspiration. McPhee places the geology in my sense of place and on the land instead of a theoretical or obscure science. I love long distance driving, I love being so close to the land and looking up at the sky; I feel as close to flying on the ground as you can be, and McPhee’s descriptions do nearly the same thing. Land and mountains seem so sure, so permanent, but we know they are not. They become sand. And after that, they sink and are piled upon by sediment to become rock again, and then sand again. So the basic building block of our planet is a grain of sand. Annie Dillard does an thought experiment of looking at a bird, and trying to visualize it becoming defeathered and de-evolved into a lizard and then back again; my favorite is while in a talus filed, or a sand dune field under mountains, to visualize them building up into mountains and then dissolving again in time; and that is why geology is the “music of the earth,” per Hans Cloos. Or as the author describes why he chose I80, it “avoids melodrama, avoids the Grand Canyons, the Jackson Holes, the geologic operas of the country, but it would surely be a sound experience of the big picture, of the history, the construction, the components of the continent. And in all likelihood it would display in its roadcuts rock from every epoch and era.” ”Slowly disassemble the Rocky Mountains and carry the material in small fragments to the Mississippi Delta. The delta builds down. It presses ever deeper on the mantle. Its depth at the moment exceeds twenty-five thousand feet. The heat and the pressure are so great down there that the silt is turning into siltstone, the sand into sandstone, the mud into shale. The Gulf of Mexico was a good example of a geosyncline, with a large part of the Rocky Mountains sitting in it as more than twenty-five thousand feet of silt, sand, and mud, siltstone, sandstone, and shale.” I hiked in the Mount Evans Wilderness recently, along a creek that was carving out the basement rock of the fourteener, and came across a rock outcrop that had an alcove below and a hanging garden above, and it was a wall of the trail, essentially and again, was drawn into a meditation of the mountain crumbling into these giant rocks who live with us for a while and then crumble into smaller stones, and then sand. It is a way of seeing I love. At the same time, beneath my feet, the sand and dirt I walk upon is putting pressure on the detritus of the mountains below us, and rock is being born. McPhee is a translator of sorts, as he says and then alchemizes it: “Geologists, in their all but closed conversation, inhabit scenes that no one ever saw, scenes of global sweep, gone and gone again, including seas, mountains, rivers, forests, and archipelagoes of aching beauty rising in volcanic violence to settle down quietly and then forever disappear—almost disappear.” This book is one of my favorite of the series, and contains the narrative description of what McPhee coined as “deep time.” He writes about the history of geology in an alive, engaging way I wish all historians could try; and as he describes James Hutton, the Scottish father of modern geology, Hutton “had no way of knowing that there were seventy million years just in the line that separated the two kinds of rock, and many millions more in the story of each formation—but he sensed something like it, sensed the awesome truth, and as he stood there staring at the riverbank he was seeing it for all humankind.” If you don’t get chills from that visual, I am sorry. To see something, to sense it, based on your eyes and mind, for all of humankind is a holy moment. “It was at some moment in the Pleistocene that humanity crossed what the geologist-theologian Pierre Teilhard de Chardin called the Threshold of Reflection, when something in people “turned back on itself and so to speak took an infinite leap forward. Outwardly, almost nothing in the organs had changed. But in depth, a great revolution had taken place: consciousness was now leaping and boiling in a space of super-sensory relationships and representations; and simultaneously consciousness was capable of perceiving itself in the concentrated simplicity of its faculties. And all this happened for the first time.” Annie Dillard wrote in 1974 and then in 1990 in more depth, about Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, so I was delighted he is in Basin and Range. Teilhard was a paleontologist, priest and philosopher and my main mantra in life is attributed to him: : \"Throughout my whole life, during every minute of it, the world has been gradually lighting up and blazing before my eyes until it has come to surround me, entirely lit up from within.\" When I read about the Threshold of Reflection, I wished I was there. In my mind, it links to the immortalized footsteps found in Tanzania where Mary Leakey found a trail of hominid footprints, as Dillard writes in For the Time Being: “They walked on moist volcanic tuff and ash. We have a record of those few seconds from a day about 3.6 million years ago—More ash covered the footprints and hardened like plaster. Ash also preserved the pockmarks of the raindrops that fell beside the three who walked: it was a rainy day. We do not know why the woman paused and turned left, briefly, before continuing. “A remote ancestor,” Leakey said, “experienced a moment of doubt.” Possibly they watched the Sadiman volcano erupting, or they took a last look back before they left. We do know we cannot make anything so lasting as these three barefoot ones did.” Perhaps they became conscious of themselves as conscious beings in that moment, meaning, perhaps, we were all there. McPhee writes, “The mind seemed to grow giddy by looking so far into the abyss of time.” Why yes, yes it did, and it still does, maybe always. Some deep time analogies: ”Geologists will sometimes use the calendar year as a unit to represent the time scale, and in such terms the Precambrian runs from New Year’s Day until well after Halloween. Dinosaurs appear in the middle of December and are gone the day after Christmas. The last ice sheet melts on December 31st at one minute before midnight, and the Roman Empire lasts five seconds.” “With your arms spread wide again to represent all time on earth, look at one hand with its line of life. The Cambrian begins in the wrist, and the Permian Extinction is at the outer end of the palm. All of the Cenozoic is in a fingerprint, and in a single stroke with a medium-grained nail file you could eradicate human history.” “The human consciousness may have begun to leap and boil some sunny day in the Pleistocene, but the race by and large has retained the essence of its animal sense of time. People think in five generations—two ahead, two behind—with heavy concentration on the one in the middle. Possibly that is tragic, and possibly there is no choice. The human mind may not have evolved enough to be able to comprehend deep time. It may only be able to measure it.” Going into the deep time meditation a little differently, about the spans of time in either direction, I loved these imageries: “There is no younger rock in the United States than the travertine that is forming in Thermopolis, Wyoming. A 2.7-billion-year-old outcrop of the core of the continent is at the head of Wind River Canyon, twenty miles away.” “And in the deep shadow below the Cambrian were seven years for everyone in all subsequent time. There were four billion years back there—since the earliest beginnings of the world.” “In six thousand years, you could never grow wings on a reptile. With sixty million, however, you could have feathers, too.” “On the geologic time scale, a human lifetime is reduced to a brevity that is too inhibiting to think about. The mind blocks the information. Geologists, dealing always with deep time, find that it seeps into their beings and affects them in various ways: “Mammalian species last, typically, two million years. We’ve about used up ours. Every time Leakey finds something older, I say, ‘Oh! We’re overdue.’ We will be handing the dominant-species-on-earth position to some other group. We’ll have to be clever not to.” “If you free yourself from the conventional reaction to a quantity like a million years, you free yourself a bit from the boundaries of human time. And then in a way you do not live at all, but in another way you live forever.”"

        "text":"This book has a rhythm unlike anything else I've read, just like geology has a timescale that takes some time to wrap your head around. It's like an opera. Geology and opera both have a reputation of being long and boring, but they are also majestic and complex. This book is long, but it's not boring! For a while, when I first started this book, my three-year-old wanted me to read every other page to her--the words were like poetry. You can't read it quickly. Reading out loud helped me settle down to the book's pace. There are lots of big words: some of the geology geek persuasion, others of the English major nerd variety...but I wasn't constantly reaching for a dictionary. McPhee throws a new geology term at you, repeats it in multiple contexts so that you get a sense of the thing, and then offers a more complete definition, just in case you still need help. It's engaging. At first I was a little bothered by the lack of photographs of everything. McPhee uses a thousand words to make a picture, but I still wouldn't recognize welded tuff if it was right in front of me. I wanted a modernized, six minute YouTube clip series complete with reality TV interviews with the geologists right at the road cut...I'm not sure I would have savored that as much though. And also, the ideas still get through. I don't want to be a geologist, and I don't need to memorize what all the rocks look like. But I have a much better picture of the complexities of the idea of plate tectonics, what it explains, what it doesn't. And while I'm sure some of the ideas presented in the book are dated, the big picture of geology hasn't changed too much from the public's perspective in the last twenty some-odd years. Each book described some section of geology along Interstate 80, as well as the background of the geologist that McPhee accompanies during that stretch of land. (You really don't have to read the books in order, if you don't want to.) Rising from the Plains was my favorite. The geologist, David Love, had a childhood much like Ralph Moody (who wrote the Little Britches series), and Love's story is woven into the geology of Wyoming beautifully. What an adventure!"

Unfortunately, that is exactly how it reads—as a stylistically interstitial relic. In recent years, science writing has largely eschewed jargon, verbiage, and writerly flourishes—focusing instead on comprehension and simplicity. This book is not simple. It does not eschew verbiage, flourishes, or scientific nomenclature. Furthermore, it is cavalierly uninterested in aiding reader comprehension. After reading 660 pages on the geology of North America, my ignorance of the subject is undiminished. I studied a little geology in college (in Wyoming, no less). I have traveled extensively throughout North America, and the terrain covered in the book (I-80 and environs, principally) is quite familiar to me. Yet I often could not picture in my mind’s eye what McPhee was describing. For whatever reason, this book was published with almost no visual aids. That is inexcusable for a deeply complex book about geology, let alone one ostensibly written for the general reader. Wikipedia entries on lithospheric phenomena are pure pleasure reading by comparison. There were, to be sure, portions of text that were smooth, enlightening, and easy to follow. Such section were rare. Midway through the book, I switched from a paperback to a Kindle version because the ability to look up obscure terms became essential. Why? Because McPhee does nothing whatsoever to ensure the reader understands what he’s talking about. He just throws scientific terms at you as if they are in everyday use and moves on. He says that something “inclines” but doesn’t tell you what he’s referring to, where it is, or what the “incline” is inclined toward. This book (which is really five books in one) has many fans and it has won many prizes. Well done. I found it exhausting."

In an attempt to remedy that, I did some brief research and came up with this book. I got the book for the Geology, I stayed for the writing. This book could be measured in pounds. The premise: seven hundred pages of nonfiction geology in United States. It sounded only slightly drier than dust, and I approached it warily. I was delightfully wrong. John McPhee's craft reminds me most of Steinbeck. (Side note, this may be the nudge up get me to finally read Steinbeck's nonfiction that's been on my shelf for years.) His book is a tapestry of character sketches and history, storytelling and journalism. I wanted to meet old geologists, and drive in a pickup truck across I-80 and drink coffee and look at rocks. Although it's technically scientific journalism, this book moved me like a story. Actually, it had more flavors and savors than much of the fiction I read. As the quote on the back cover by A O Scott says \"a deep philology of the continent... surely a classic.\" I agree. I'm delighted that this book won a pulitzer prize, and I will this again."

Its a compilation of all of McPhee's writings about American continental Geology. I know, sounds dull, but he uses the lives and characters of the Geologists whose work he is describing along with the massive narrative arc of plate tectonics and the history of the science itself. The story of America's westward expansion along with the Romantic era of northeastern America all seem to blend into a text that can miraculously also explain geomorphology and other remarkably dry topics. Gives the vast expanses of time a tiny human scale which we can then wonder at how our ancestors saw these places as well as the painstaking detective work that was critical to our understanding of how they formed, where these places came from and how in something as seemingly stolid as the ground beneath our feet is a plastic and still changing skin manipulated by forces beyond human comprehension.

        "text":"One of the geologist-contacts of John McPhee explains the impact his professional life has on his perspective: \"You care less about civilization. Half of me gets upset with civilization. The other half does not get upset. I shrug and think, So let the cockroaches take over.\" This, in a nutshell, is the escapism offered by this particular Pulitzer-winning magnum opus. Yeah, that CO2 buildup and our plastic debris will leave a permanent mark, but four billion years of rocks don't care about your pandemic anxiety. The volume is a collection of five books written by McPhee between 1978 and 1999 aimed at describing not only the rock exposed in roadcuts across the United States but also the geologists with whom he traveled. Because I borrowed the e-book from the library, I confess I had no idea I was delving into such a massive volume until I was probably 30 pages in. But at that point, I was hooked. Not that I always knew what McPhee was talking about. There was fatigued rock and incompetent rock and inequigranular fabric in rock. If you bent or folded rock, the inside of the curve was in a state of compression, the outside of the curve was under great tension, and somewhere in the middle was the surface of no strain -- the two sides were active in every fault. The inclination of a slope on which boulders would stay put was the angle of repose. Jargon can be poetic. There were festooned crossbeds and limestone sinks, pillow lavas and petrified trees, incised meanders and defeated streams. There were dike swarms and slickensides, explosion pits, volcanic bombs. Pulsating glaciers. Hogbacks. Radiolarian ooze. And while I probably read the word batholith fifty times without ever bothering to look it up, through all the texture McPhee imparts wonderfully not only five books' worth of geological knowledge, he builds throughout the volume, offering deeper perspectives in the later books. The setup is far from linear. You don't start in the east and end up in California. You jump around. But you do benefit from the fact that in the 20-year period McPhee wrote these books, his understanding of the evolution of the field as the plate tectonics revolution unfolded also grew. Plate tectonics became universally accepted in the '60s, only a few years before the first volume was written. By the '90s, a flourishing of understanding based on technology including isotopes and gravity fields and magnetic fields had brought to light so much more than when he started. One aspect of the writing that makes it come alive is the fact that it's about geologists as much as it's about geology. McPhee describes the geology only in the context of the dedicated men and women who live for the study. \"We are blind men feeling the elephant,\" David Love, of the Geological Survey, has said to me at least fifty times, he writes, referencing the Hindu fable of the blind men touching only one small piece of the creature while trying to infer the whole of it. The foremost problem with the Picture is that ninety-nine per cent of it is missing -- melted or dissolved, torn down, washed away, broken to bits, to become something else in the Picture. The geologist discovers lingering remains, and connects them with dotted lines. Geologists \"try to put the petals back on the flower.\" The ideal scenario for reading this book would be during a cross-country trip across I-80. But absent that real field experience, I found myself pulling up countless YouTube videos to accompany my reading, which enabled me to better visualize a lot of what McPhee describes. Plate tectonics is the star of the show, the framework around which everything else occurs. But the whole of the story is much more complex. Specific geologies are complex and messy. The Appalachians, for example, weren't simply formed the way the Himalayas are today, by two plates violently colliding. They were more the result of a schedule of arrivals of incoming exotic terranes – multiple collisions – over a long spread of time. \"Hotspots\" determine new island arcs and may even help cause continents to split. A thin crust and upraised mantle facilitate basin-and-range formation in Nevada today. Ice sheets set up and started Niagara Falls, moved the Ohio River, dug the Great Lakes. There was continental rifting below Nebraska and Iowa 1.1 billion years ago that stopped before it could turn to ocean. Pokagon State Park, Indiana is made of Canadian rocks, red jasper conglomerates from the north shore of Lake Huron, banded gray gneisses from central Ontario. Boston is African rock and the north of Ireland is American. Some other morsels: In any rock column, more time is missing than present, because erosion is a bigger driving force than orogeny (the building of mountains). And rock columns are more likely to commemorate a moment – a flood, an eruption – than to report a millennium. Like a news broadcast, it is more often a montage of disasters than a cumulative record of time. I visited the Grand Canyon at the age of thirteen. The park is uniquely suited to hitting visitors over the head with what McPhee calls its \"layer-cake\" geology, a gorgeous and linear time scale. But geology is rarely so accommodating. Rock isn't just laid down. It is turned on its side or upside-down. It metamorphosizes and gets moved thousands of miles. It melds with other rocks. The complexity is staggering. The whole Appalachian system continually fed upon itself. There are Precambrian pebbles, in Silurian rock. You'll see Silurian pebbles in Devonian rock, Devonian pebbles in Mississippian rock. Geology repeats itself. Even the wind can play an outsized role in favor of erosion. McPhee describes how a substantial amount of erosion from the Rocky mountains might end up as dust blown by storms into the North Atlantic Ocean. Oil deposits are correlated with conodont fossils of a particular hue. The presence of conodonts in the rock is an indicator of their being the right age, and the color of the fossils is in indication of the level of compression the rocks have undergone, a determinant of oil formation from carbon deposits. California is in large part a collection and compactation of oceanic islands. The \"Smartville arc\" brought gold to California. Toward the end of the middle Jurassic – in the high noon of the dinosaurs, about a hundred and sixty-five million years ago – an island arc like the Aleutians or Japan had moved in from the western ocean and docked here. This was the third terrane at this latitude: the one that followed Sonomia and smashed into it with crumpling, mountain-building effects that propogated eastward turning soils into phyllites, sandstones into quartzites, siltstones into slates – the metamorphics we had seen up the road. In aggregate, the three terranes extended the continent by at least four hundred miles. The third one, suturing here, had doubled the width of what is now California. … If the story of California sounds fantastic, with all its accreting arcs and melanges coming up from the western sea, just look at a map of the southwest Pacific – look at the relationship between Australia and Indonesia right now. [Hot spots] Great Meteor and Cape Verde seem to have lifted New England's high mountains, Bermuda the Smokies. Uplift accelerates erosion. The rock of the Permian period – the last chapter in the Appalachian mountain building story – has been removed everywhere in eastern America except in West Virginia and nearby parts of Ohio and Pennsylvania, halfway between the hot-spot tracks, halfway between New Hampshire and North Carolina. An ophiolite is a section of the Earth's oceanic crust and the underlying upper mantle that has been uplifted and exposed above sea level and often emplaced onto continental crustal rocks. The presence of ophiolites – which we see in California, among other places – is a consequence of continental collisions with oceanic plates. One geologist likened the ophiolite to a cow on a cowcatcher in front of an old western train. The earth as a whole is producing progressively less heat from radioactive decay, and that, at some point, is going to have a profound effect. In the future, the profound effect is going to be that the plates will stop moving. The plate tectonics revolution isn't the only recent revolution in geology. The ability to identify the age of rocks is significantly more advanced than it was in the day when the presence of fossils were the main yardstick. Iron minerals line up like compasses, pointing toward the changing magnetic poles. Isotope decay rates are known and constant. Rock types can be identified by their magnetic signatures. The magnetic field is sampling the shallow crust, the upper few thousand feet. The gravity field is averaging, basically, the whole lithosphere. When you look at a gravity map you are seeing deeper features of the crust. One problem with writing about science is that as any book is written, it immediately is threatened with obsolescence. McPhee observed, The thought occurs to me, not for the first time, that I am following a science as it lurches forward from error to discovery and back to error. But this is actually as much an asset of the writing as it is a detraction. I expect this volume will be worth reading even a hundred years from now because it is not just a textbook. It's written in the form of journeys, set pieces, flashbacks, biographical sketches, and histories of the human and lithic kind . And at the same time, it offers discovery and insight."

I've always liked rocks and the thought of what went on before we got here - why things are the way they are - and what is going to continue long after we are gone has a certain appeal. There's a certain comfort that comes in reading about something that doesn't give a shit about the Dow Jones, ISIS, Obama, American Idol and the Superbowl. It's a planet doing it's thing and there's nothing you can do to stop it. It's not a predictive science. The geologic history in this book is interwoven with man's history in this country as it relates to the areas across a specific latitude of the US. Though there is a lot of rocks to wade through I really enjoyed the book. I probably didn't absorb much of the various delineations of geologic time aside from Precambrian and everything that came after - but in context to how long people have been around - it really puts things in perspective. The the history of earth were the length of \"Stairway to Heaven\" we would be part of of one of the syllables of Plant's last utterance of the word Heaven as the song ends - maybe not even that much. There were some very eye opening things that I never knew about as well as far as how North America came together. I was always under the impression that we just sort of floated away from Pangeia or the first continent and that was it - apparently not.

My favorite parts were the vignettes connecting geology to history - the gold miners in the Sierra Nevadas, the cowboys in Wyoming, even the vacationers in the Delaware Water Gap. (I was disappointed that this vignette was missing from the final \"book,\" Crossing the Craton .) Each book also introduced a new geological phenomenon, which were the parts I suspect I'll remember best. Other parts were tougher to finish. I often struggled to follow the long passages describing how specific geographical places came to be - describing rocks being shoved up, eroding, being covered, flipping, and deformed by other rocks. I get that this is how geology works, but it doesn't always translate to the written page. Also, as I said in my review for \"Assembling California,\" I'd love to see more pictures and maps. However, for all my complaints, I am now a geology fan and have a much deeper appreciation for the earth around me. I'd guess that's what John McPhee would have wanted me to get out of it."

Verbindendes Element ist die Geologie des amerikanischen Kontinents, und doch geht es immer auch um die Gegenwart und Geschichte der USA.

        "text":"Remember driving along a highway and passing through a road cut where the layers of stone in the hillside rise and descend as you pass. John McPhee began to wonder about these roadcuts and over several years compiled a geologic history of the United States through interviews and feild trips with geology professors from New York to San Francisco. His epic adventure immerses readers in deep deep time, a complex poetry of terminology, and a fascinating array of personal stories. He continually reconnects the geology of the narrative to the reader through frequent references to history and periodic sprinklings of wry humor. And it's not all geology; You'll be amazed by Geologist David Love's family history and thrilled and appalled at the rapid-fire recounts of experiences of the Loma Prieta earthquake of 1988, when slabs of double-decker highway dropped onto commuter vehicles and Candlestick Park shook duriing the world Series. This is not a strictly layman's book. The language is dense, the concepts unfamiliar, and the few illustrations, diagrams and maps insufficient to clarify much of the text. However, McPhee possesses the sensibilities of both journalist and poet. While the reader may have to soldier through ignornance and inexperience at times, the 660 page journey creates a satisfying understanding of the precepts and questions posed by geologists and geology and a grounding sense of the theory of geological time and the formation of the surface of our planet. Overall, it makes me feel small and ephemeral."

Mr. McPhee isn't afraid of using the correct scientific terminology, isn't worried that the verbiage might be over the heads of many readers. The result is a satisfying read that doesn't insult the intelligence of the reader because, above all else, his writing style is both informative AND entertaining, without any need to \"dumb it down\" into monosyllabic pap. The story unfolds kaleidoscopically, beginning in New Jersey, then away to the West along Highway 81, through many unlikely times and places such as an old silent-era Mack Sennett movie, Butch Cassidy's Hole-In-The-Wall gang and a world series baseball game interrupted by a devastating earthquake, and even a multi-million-dollar silver find in what was suppoed to be an exhausted tailings pile. From the professor of geology trying to inspire fresh new minds in the classroom to the weekend rock hound, to the armchair surfer just looking for a thick and well written tome to help pass rainy days, this book is an excellent choice."

From the San Andreas Fault to the ancient rift valleys of New Jersey, over basin and range, synclines and sediments, and across the remnants of continental ice sheets and Rocky Mountain orogenies, McPhee weaves together the geologic history of the United States. Composed of five books, each tackling a discrete piece of time and space, this anthology crisscrosses the continent and in the process elucidates not just the distant past, but also the rich characters who are now piecing together its story. Impeccably researched, written in a style that is precise without being overly technical, and with just the right ratio of humor to gravitas, McPhee’s prose shines. This is one heck of a book. Edit: I reread this book, this time in geographic order from west to east, before and during my trip from California back to Iowa. I liked it just as much, maybe even more."

I'd always thought geology was \"just rocks\" until I read this. But McPhee takes you into the lives of his geologist guides, teaches you about the big breakthroughs in the science, and takes you through some geological events, some slow (like orogeny, one of my new favorite words) and some fast (the Loma Prieta earthquake). You learn a lot, but there are poetical passages in which he just lets the luscious, metaphorical terminology of the science wash over you; don't try to understand every paragraph word-for-word. This is broken into five sections, four of which were previously published separately. One can read a section on its own, take a break, and then come back to this huge tome."

    "desc":"‘John McPhee is celebrated in America and all but unknown in this country. The volume I love most is Coming into the Country, an account of Alaska and the Alaskans. His genius is that he can write about anything.’ – Robert Macfarlane In this unforgettable and astutely observed travel account, Pulitzer Prize-winner John McPhee journeys into the wild frontiers and frigid climate of Alaska – exploring the diverse terrain of this Northern US state. Travelling by foot and canoe, helicopter and dog team, McPhee traverses total wilderness, urban landscape, and the depths of the bush, drawing a rich and comprehensive history of this vast land and its varied inhabitants. With his keen eye and poetic sensibility at the helm, we paddle with McPhee through the salmon-filled waters of the Brooks Range Rivers, meet a young chief of the Athapaskan tribe, and become well-acquainted with the habits of the barren-ground grizzly bear. We encounter settlers along the way and discover the extraordinary dreams that impel them to survive in one of the most remote regions on Earth. McPhee is an endlessly curious adventurer and Coming into the Country is the work of a master storyteller. ‘It is a reviewer’s greatest pleasure to ring the gong for a species of masterpiece.’ – New York Times Book Review ‘McPhee has acted like an antenna in a far-off place that few will see. He has brought back a wholly satisfying voyage of spirit and mind.’ – Time ‘With this book McPhee proves to be the most versatile journalist in America.’ – New York Times",

        "text":"This was the first non-geology McPhee book for me — and a test to see whether I started to find geology fascinating or whether it’s McPhee’s writing chops that did the trick for me. Well, maybe geology rocks indeed, but McPhee is where the magic is. A good writer is like a wizard with words. Obviously. “Alaska is a foreign country significantly populated with Americans. Its languages extend to English. Its nature is its own.” Here we get to see 1977 Alaska, which is a beautiful but strange place. A remote and huge expanse of land with competing ideas to apply the frontier approach to it or keep it as preserve of nature for those who have little in the way of pristine nature elsewhere, a place that attracts wilderness enthusiasts and people who’d prefer to be left alone as they make their living in whichever way they please whether they are permitted so or not, those who’d prefer use and exploit and those who wants to conserve, the spirit of individualism and collectivism, and the ever-receding wilderness. All that in the same place and time, and sometimes even in the same people. “They invite a question. To a palate without bias – the palate of an open-minded Berber, the travelling Martian – which would be the more acceptable, a pink-icinged Pop-Tart with raspberry filling (cold) or the fat gob from behind a caribou’s eye?” We see the forests and rivers where bears roam and salmon swim, the tiny remote towns full of tensions and dramas, and the efforts to move the state capital from Juneau to a bunch of other places (the campaign that as we know 50-ish years later ended up unsuccessful). It’s pretty much three books in one - wild Alaska (Salmon River), rural Alaska (Upper Yukon, the settlement of Eagle) and urban Alaska (Juneau, Anchorage). McPhee’s own presence is stronger in this book than in his geology series. He’s here hiking though the wilderness, terrified of bears, taking a canoe down the river, fishing, and hanging out with quite a few characters whose rugged quirks are fascinating. And he shines through the crisp clear prose with sharp vivid observations. The imagery is strong, the descriptions are crystal-clear and fresh and often surprising and wonderfully effective. “Looking over the side of the canoe is like staring down into a sky full of zeppelins.” One thing I got out of this book is that I’m not Alaska material, but enjoying it through McPhee filter was lovely and oftentimes a bit scary. 4 stars. —————— Also posted on my blog ."

        "text":"I was really hoping this would be about geology, along the lines of Basin and Range . It wasn't. It's divided into three sections; in the first, McPhee wanders around unpopulated Alaska with several other men in several canoes\/kayaks. I think one was from the Sierra Club, one from the Bureau of Land Management, etc. They fished to supplement their food supplies, and camped along the rivers and streams. The second section was about the attempt to get Alaska's capital moved from Juneau. I now know more about this issue than I ever wanted to. At the end of the section it really sounded like the move was going to come off; people voted and wanted the capital moved to Willow. (This was written in 1977.) But a check of the primary authority on such matters, Wikipedia, shows that Juneau is still the capital, so McPhee must have been stoned or something when he wrote that sentence. In the third section McPhee moved to Eagle, a teeny tiny town on the Yukon River, and pretty much just interviewed the residents of Eagle and told us their stories. Some are interesting; some aren't. (The 2010 census showed the population of Eagle as 86.) In spite of the need for women to be tough in the wilds of Alaska, there are no women's libbers here. The women do all the cookin' and much, much more; wood choppin', skinnin' of critters, waitin' for the menfolk to come a-home from their trips. Maybe a few people sound relatively sane, but most sound a bit crazy. Or a lot crazy. There are your Cliven Bundy types up there. They don't like the people of the lower 48 dictating the rules in Alaska. Alaska is different. People of Alaska, hear me: Alaska is not different. It is a state that in many respects is qualitatively different from, say, Connecticut. It is not legally, Constitutionally, different. Because you build a cabin on a plot of land, trap and hunt your own critters for food, bulldoze yourself a gravel landing strip for your little plane, it does not follow that you now own that land. Don't get all uppity when the Bureau of Land Management comes to tell you you don't actually own that land. You know how I know I own my home? Because I wrote a check; the bank agreed to supply the rest; we had a ceremony (with lawyers for both sides) where we all signed many sheets of paper; and at the end of it one of these sheets of paper was the title and deed to my home. Plus I pay real estate taxes on this home. If the Bureau of Land Management comes to tell me I don't own my home, then we have a problem. You, Alaska trapper and fisher with no title to your little cabin, you don't have a problem. McPhee's writing style wears thin. This was 438 pages of it."

This is so because bushplane trips are more common than taxis or driving, the roads being what they are. -- Fried cranberries will help a sore throat . -- That somethings are better left unchanged or not re-named: \"What would you call that mountain, Willie?\" \"Denali. I'll go along with the Indians that far.\" Everyone aboard was white but Willie (William Igiagruq Hensley), of Arctic Alaska, and he said again, \"Denali. What the hell did McKinley ever do? I learned the difference between a visitor and a tourist in Alaska: A tourist stays a week and drops four hundred dollars. A visitor comes with a shirt and a twenty-dollar bill and doesn't change either one . I learned that Alaska is a great place for nicknames: Pete the Pig, Pistolgrip Jim, Groundsluice Bill, Coolgardie Smith, Codfish Tom, Doc LaBooze, the Evaporated Kid, Fisty McDonald, John the Baptist, Cheeseham Sam, and the Man with the Big Nugget. I actually came across a Codfish in my own travels, but I have an odd job. I learned that bear scat is \"fairly, but not acutely fresh\" when it \"glistens but has stopped smoking.\" Not everything I learned will I actually use. I learned that Alaska, at least the Alaska of 1977, was a place where people, tired of government and other people, fled to. I learned that the government followed them there and refused to let them alone. I learned that Alaskans are prone to a philosophy: LIVE EACH DAY SO THAT YOU CAN LOOK EVERY DAMN MAN IN THE EYE AND TELL HIM TO GO TO HELL. We need such people. At least we need a place where such people could go. A place I might go if it wasn't so cold. A place so vast and unpeopled that if anyone could figure out how to steal Italy, Alaska would be a place to hide it . This was another wonderful trip that John McPhee took me on. It's dated, to be sure. But wonderful characters are portrayed; good stories told. In the battle between independent, brave individuals and a pedantic, fuzzy-wuzzy government, John McPhee leaves no doubt whose side he is on."

        "text":"A year or two out of college I was employed at a bookshop in Seattle, earning little more than minimum wage. For a change of scene, I signed up with some friends to work the salmon season at a cannery in Alaska. It was rough work, seven days a week, 8am to 11pm (or to 1am on nights when you had cleanup duty). We didn’t get to see much of “real Alaska,” but you could feel it around you. The wilderness. The cannery was located on an island in the southeast of the state. The town was small for anyplace other than Alaska, with not much more than a single road. The rest of the island was uninhabited. People wandering into the interior were sometimes never heard from again. No one went in search of them. It was assumed the wolves or bears had got them. The moss and muskeg would hide their bones. Though I saw little of Alaska, it was enough to grasp its fascination. If my sense of it had faded some over the past twenty years, McPhee’s wonderful book has helped to revive it. I suddenly find myself scheming ways to get the wife and kids up north on vacation as soon as possible. One of my college professors first introduced me to John McPhee. It was a writing course, and he was reading brief passages from one of McPhee’s books (I don’t recall which one), lingering over certain passages and expostulating on the genius of his prose, his crystalline expressions. McPhee is rarely flashy. There is no false posturing. He is curious, broad, but crisp, fresh, clear. My former favorite of McPhee’s books (among those I have read) was Basin and Range , but Coming into the Country is just as good. The first part of it follows McPhee on an outing in the total wild of the Brooks Range. The second has to do with the politics of the state circa 1977. The third, and by far the longest, is the best. In it, McPhee lives with and among the trappers, the miners, the townspeople, the hippie kids and the Athapaskan natives of the Yukon River country near the Canadian border. In this small but broadly scattered and loose-knit community, McPhee finds all the hope, discontent and anxiety of the human condition. It’s a parable (perhaps) of the riddling complexities that face us today, finding ourselves to be a part of the natural order and yet standing, somehow, outside of it."

We were in Newfoundland a year ago, a lovely holiday and upon the world's most uncomfortable couch I found reruns of Northern Exposure. I loved the show back in its heyday. It appeared apt, especially the episode where on Thanksgiving the First nation people through tomatoes at the white people. A few months after that, we returned from Serbia to discover that Amazon Prime now had all of Northern Exposure in its content vault. I then viewed every episode. Thus, I was intrigued by McPhee's description of the eccentrics who leave the \"Lower 48\" and venture north. There are three sections, the first dealing with a canoe and kayak trip rife with conversation about conservation and bear attacks. The second details urban Alaska and political tensions; this crystallized in ballot measure to move the state capitol. The final section is a series of portraits which in juxtaposition create an Alaskan mesh, forever in disunion. Was I ever disappointed! Perhaps the blame should rest with me, if only partially. I just recoiled from the arrogance, intentional or not. I enjoyed the sections detailing bush pilots but disliked nearly everything else."

        "text":"2023 - ‘70’s Immersion Reading Challenge Coming Into the Country: A remarkable voyage of spirit and mind into America’s last great wilderness - Alaska by John McPhee (1976; 1979 ed.) 417 pages. If you are from Alaska, then you are definitely going to want to read this book. Alaska was going through huge progressive changes in the 1970’s. The author smoothly interweaves a bit of history and politics with interviews of the natives, especially in and around Eagle, which was the first incorporated town of interior Alaska situated on the Yukon River. In the ’70’s, Alaska was in its third gold boom and now the oil boom. The U.S. government was moving in and changing the climate in Alaska. The author, from New Jersey, traveled to Alaska to feel and experience the last wild piece of America, and to interview these locals and natives to get their feelings about the changes taking place. This book is divided into three sections: The Encircled River , What They Were Hunting For , and Coming Into the Country . (1) The Encircled River McPhee and four other guys, who worked for the U.S. government, began a canoe and kayak expedition at the head of the 60 mile long Salmon River in the Brooks Range that runs through the Baird Mountains in Kobuk Valley National Park, Alaska. It is the most northern river above the Arctic Circle. Their purpose was to study the river as a national wild river that Congress would be voting on the following year, 1978, to become part of the Kobuk Valley National Monument, along with 15 other millions of acreages they were to vote on for national parks. The natives would soon have to accept the idea of now owning property and having boundaries; whereas, before they were roamers, following the herds of moose and caribou. The legislation passed under Jimmy Carter on December 2, 1980. McPhee learned from his adventuring guides, that it takes money to go into the bush to hunt and fish. These men moved to Alaska only to find their dreams of hunting or fishing squashed because the reality of it is you need lots of money to charter planes out to areas where the fish, moose and caribou even exist. (2) What They Were Hunting For What they were hunting for back in the 1970’s was a new place to move the capital from Juneau, which had been the state capital since 1906. There were no roads into Juneau. One had to hire a bush pilot and fly in. McPhee flew around with the committee in charge to scout out the three possible sites for the new capital: Lake Larson, Mount Yenlo, and Willow, which all three would have been more centrally located between the two rival cities of Anchorage and Fairbanks, but much closer to Anchorage. Willow won the vote and construction was supposed to begin in 1980. (p. 169) The author didn’t know at the time, when the book was published in 1977, that the capital of Alaska would not be moved in 1980 because here it is year 2023 and Juneau is still the capital, and, by the way, you still have to charter flights into the city. This section of the book gives interesting insight into the steps the Alaskan government took to try and change it….and the expense, into the millions of dollars spent, just to try and find a suitable place that never panned out. (3) Coming into the Country The upper Yukon is referred to as “the country”. A stranger arriving up there is said to have “come into the country”. (p. 175) This part of the book is the longest and is all about the native locals who live and survive on the Yukon River, in and around Eagle. The author stayed at the homes of these natives and participated with them in gold digging, hunting and hiking expeditions, while getting their views on the progressive changes taking place in Alaska. He gives great insight into the lives of these people and their environment, with a little history, on Eagle. The hard truth about living “in the country” of Alaska… A lot of these people who keep coming into the country don’t belong here. They have fallen in love with a calendar photo and they want to live under a beautiful mountain. When they arrive the reality doesn’t match the dream. It’s too much for them. They don’t want to work hard enough; they don’t want to spread out – to go far enough up the streams. (Richard Okey “Dick” Cook, came into the country in 1964 from Lyndhurst, Ohio, p. 253) Page 410 tells of the authors own struggles to pick sides. He enjoys the beautiful national parks and wildlife refuges….and I do too. I’m so glad we have them. At the same time, I do realize that progress, and even just the preservation of land, comes with a double-edged sword, putting an end to one way of life for another. Many of the natives are implementing, and prefer using, modern tools and equipment (aluminum boats with their Evinrude motors, ski-doos, fuel, guns, purchased rations, and, of course, government subsidies). And because of this, they are forced into taking jobs in the bigger cities, away from their families, for a season to make money to pay for those conveniences they have come to depend on. That’s part of the payoff! ——————————————— INTERESTING FACTS ALASKA NATIVE CLAIMS SETTLEMENT ACT OF 1971 Alaska was purchased from Russia for $7.2 million in 1867, but didn’t become a state until 1959. It wasn’t until 1971 when the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act gave the natives (Eskimos, Indians and Aleuts) one billion dollars and 44 million acres of land. A lot of this land, as we now know today, contained gold, silver, other minerals and oil and gas rights, which they were and would be able to profit from. (p. 145) A much different situation compared to how the natives were treated previously in the lower 48. HOMESTEADING IN ALASKA In the 1862 Homestead Act, homesteaders were given 160 acres, free of charge, for coming to Alaska. They had to live on the property for three years, build a dwelling to live in and grow a crop on an eighth of the land (p. 161), but that deal ended in 1974…according to this author. But, another source online states the 1862 Homestead Act officially ended on October 21, 1976 with a 10-year extension for Alaska. The last free, 160-acre homestead was claimed on October 21, 1986. (U.S. Department of the Interior Bureau of Land Management: “History of Alaska Homesteading”, ) But, even after the homestead act ended, it appears people would still go and build small cabins deep into the interior Alaska, believing they had staked a claim to a piece of Alaska, and little was ever mentioned. But, if oil was discovered on the land, or even nearby, the U.S. Government would send officials through the area on helicopters to dish out eviction notices, and it didn’t matter how long you had been established there. (p. 232-33, 236) The State of Alaska had until 1984 to finish choosing its 103 million acres, which much was in the way of parks, government forests, wildlife refuges, huge petroleum reserves in the north, and the 44 million acres appropriated to natives. There wasn’t much land left for squatters, or want-to-be-homesteaders, to sneak in a cabin anywhere. (p. 234) GOLD IN ALASKA (1) 1890’s - $17\/oz. (2) 1934 - Government set price at $35\/oz. (3) 1970’s - for first time gold was allowed to float with the market and Americans were allowed to buy and keep gold. It rose to nearly $200\/oz., settling to $150\/oz. (p. 219) Today, n 2023, the price of gold is $1,832\/oz., fluctuating with the daily market (Forbes Advisor at Forbes.com online website). Recreational gold panning is still allowed on public lands, such as national forest, wildlife refuges, some state parks, national parks (higher restrictions), lands administrated by the Bureau of Land Management and the State of Alaska. To determine if an area is open to mineral entry and if there are legal mining claims in an area, contact the state Division of Mining or, for claims on federal lands, the Bureau of Land Management. Once you have determined land status, know that it is public land, that it is open to mineral entry, and that it has no legal claims, check with the managing agency to determine what restrictions might be in force. (Recreational Gold Mining in Alaska @ myalaskan.com, accessed 3\/3\/2023) For gold panning on private property, you must have owners permission. For the use of any heavy equipment, you must have a permit."

        "text":"This book has meant a lot to me as an Alaskan interested in the raggedy interplay between development and conservationism, although I had never read it in its entirety. Now I have. I would say this book at best offers a kind, sympathetic view of all sorts of Alaskans circa 1977, a period which I just barely remember from grade school. I still recall the statewide debate on whether to give \"Mount McKinley\" the new\/old name of \"Denali\" as part of ANILCA, then called the D-2 Lands Bill, which was a hot-button topic (i.e. federal take-over) for Alaskans such as my parents. I remember the debate to move the capital to Willow. I remember John Denver's goodwill trip to Alaska to promote conservation and the passage of ANILCA. It was all HIGHLY charged politics in which the feds were dabbling, playing, frivolizing with OUR land. The outgrowth of both the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act and the Alaska National Interest Land Conservation Act are INCREDIBLY far reaching with regards to living and working in Alaska today. In that respect, the first two chapters of the book are now dated and rather nostalgic, kind of a time-capsule of what was going on while these landmark Congressional laws were being sussed out. The chapter \"Coming Into The Country\" (nearly half of the book) on the Yukon River\/Charley River area of Interior Alaska was by far the best part of the book, focusing on the communities of Central, Circle, and Eagle and the idealistic, sometimes hard-nosed characters that live there. Although McPhee, in what I've read, was an impressionable young man leaning to the side of environmental conservation at the expense of economic development, I think his writing in this book shows both a reverence for Alaska's brand of wilderness (in a word, awesome) as well as a sympathetic, humane perspective on the toll that Congressional protectionism, environmental regulation, and romantic idealism has on the lives of real families living in \"the country\". (The best writing is the transcription of journal entries made by a young man, Rich Corazza, living alone in a cabin somewhere around Eagle. This section is one third into the last section \"Coming Into The Country\" and made me grin and laugh out loud. A true seeker with a good dose of humor and longing.)"

        "text":"“If anyone could figure out how to steal Italy, Alaska would be the place to hid it.\" What a vivid way to describe Alaska's immensity. 'There has been a host of excellent books on Alaska. My favorite until recently was Joe McGinnis's Going to Extremes but John McPhee's Coming Into the Country is wonderful, too. McPhee's book is divided into three parts: first an exploration of wilderness described during the course of a canoe\/kayak trip down the Salmon River. Much in the manner of the river, his descriptions meander into all sorts of eddies and whirlpools. His description of bush pilots is priceless. On one occasion he is flying (a regularly scheduled airline, mind you) in a single engine plane in horrible weather. The pilot is skimming the trees to find landmarks because he can't see anything. He has a map on his lap, but suddenly hands it to a passenger to help figure out where they are. \"I had been chewing gum so vigorously that the hinges of my jaws would ache for two days.\" Stumbling on a grizzly bear in a blueberry patch (fortunately upwind), he muses on the best way to survive a grizzly's charge - no consensus of opinion, but most survivors believe the best thing to do is stand absolutely still and shout as loudly as possible, for that is the least likely reaction the bear, which does not have good sight, would expect of game. Running away is useless for grizzlies are very fast. They are also quite coordinated. They enjoy schussing down snow-covered mountains at 96 feet\/second through trees and around boulders only to screech to a stop, stand up and walk away, just before going -over the edge of a cliff. The second part of the book discusses the Alaskan government's search for a new capital and the conflict that generated. Juneau really makes a lousy site because of its remoteness, not to mention its horrible landing approach to the airport. Alaska attracts very independent and anti-authoritarian types of people so it witnesses a battle between those suffering from the \"Sierra Club Syndrome\" or others fondly embracing the \"Dallas Scenario.\" Many of these folks are affectionately profiled in the third section. John Cook, for example, has consciously tried to eliminate the need for money and authority. He tries to live on $1,500 a year (this was written in the mid seventies); he has a series of trap line s and rarely uses a parka, even at -30'. The closest town is Eagle, about 30 miles away via dog sled, with a population of about 100. Almost all live by the ut restrictions on code, \"Never put restrictions on any individual.... Up here they ain't gettin' you for spittin' on the sidewalk.\" Ironically, most moved there for the space, yet land is less available (as of 1977) than in the lower '48 because when Alaska became a state deals were made with the native Americans and the federal government to set aside almost the entire state as either a reservation or park land. Whereas before statehood someone could build a cabin 80 miles from nowhere, now a government helicopter might fly over and throw them out. Homesteading no longer exists, but in Alaska that loss seems especially poignant in territory where you might have to fly somewhere to take a shower."

So this is the third time I've read it. I've read maybe ten books three times, so I really, really like this. First, because McPhee writes so beautifully. He could write about anything and I would read it. I've even read his geology books. Not because I like geology, (I don't), but because I just eat up his words. It is like eating chocolate, I usually stop when the supply runs out, not because I'm finished. Second, the people and the spirit that makes up Alaska. Everything is so unbelievably huge. I love the stories about people who cut tractors up into pieces, fly them to remote regions, weld them back together so they can build an airstrip for a bigger plane. Third, the Alaska he writes about was disappearing when he wrote it, and has been replaced with at least two generations of Alaska since then. I will be visiting Alaska this summer and I am looking forward to seeing what's new and what remains of the old. Will it be strip malls? I'll let you know."

        "text":"This book is a somewhat lengthy discussion of three different aspects of Alaskan existence.  Although I have traveled to Alaska, I must admit that I am not very knowledgeable about its ways, although I have a few friends who have lived there and could probably have more to say about the sorts of deep divisions that Alaskan society has.  I must say, though, that in general much of the sort of division shown here is something that I can relate to as someone with a generally strong knowledge of the divisiveness of life in rural America and the wellspring of ambivalence there is about government and identity in many parts of the United States outside of the big cities.  Alaska does seem, at least in this book, to be a very small world, and small worlds have a great degree of similarity in that they bring out the pettiness and fractiousness of people to a greater extent than is evident when one looks only at human beings en masse.  If this book was definitely not my favorite by the author, it certainly provided, as always, an entertaining look at people the author happens to be spending a lot of time with. This nearly 450 page book is divided into three parts that explore different aspects of the Alaskan experience.  In the first book, \"The Encircled River,\" the author goes on an adventurous kayak adventure in one of Alaska's many Salmon Rivers, surrounded by the Brooks Range in northern Alaska and dealing with people as varied as forest Eskimos and government employees who want to protect large swaths of Alaskan wilderness as well as the possibility of harm from Alaska's massive grizzlies.  The second book, \"What They Were Hunting For,\" is a rather grim and self-absorbed look at Alaskans hunting for a location for a new state capital, arguing about the dominance of Anchorage, and demonstrating a distinct lack of interest in the rest of the world outside of their large but remote state, which at times almost seems like foreign territory for all it knows or cares of the lower 48.  Finally, the third book, \"Coming Into The Country,\" examines the divisions and rivalries among a group of people who have mostly left behind their life in the lower 48 and come to live in Alaska seeking homesteads, quarreling with the government while sometimes seeking public aid, and worried about politics and religion and questions of identity. Indeed, as a whole this particular book demonstrates the ferocity of identity questions when one looks at Alaska.  A wide variety of people seek very different things in coming to Alaska, including space from others even while remaining dependent on logistical chains going to larger cities, political power in a small world where it does not take much to be a big fish (and this even before Sarah Palin), and a desire to create a somewhat anarchical society with little money that is funded by government largess due to the oil wealth there, as well as an unspoiled wilderness free of anyone but themselves to sort out boundaries and questions of who deserves the landfalls to be received from the exploitation of the Alaskan wilderness and its resources.  I must admit that I do not find the Alaskans to be all that different from the people I grew up around, and I was pleased to find so many interested in books despite the difficulties of collecting books in such remote territory.  If Alaska is a bit cold and remote for my tastes, the tensions of Alaskan society are only slightly more exaggerated than those of most rural areas in the American west or south, for similar reasons of colonialism."

        "text":"McPhee's Coming Into the Country is rightly considered a classic with its detailed description on life in mid-1970s Alaska. Much of the writing is stunning, packed full of river trips and anecdotes about characters the author encountered during his many months in the country. He captures well the contradictions embodied in many Alaskans: a thirst for solitude alternating with a an affinity for social gatherings, an abhorrence of government even as they live and trap on public land, and the sparse population combined with a sense that there are few places left to go, live, and be free. McPhee's writing style full of rapid fire quotes summing up various points of view is effective in conveying these contradictions. He also captures an important transitional time in the state's history when the Trans-Alaskan oil pipeline and the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act were new realities. Read nearly 40 years after it was published, I believe the book reflects an important historical slice of Alaskan culture. Despite the overall high quality of writing, I found that some parts dragged (I found myself skimming dozens of pages related to a possible shift of Alaska's capital city from Juneau to parts unknown). If 4.5 stars were possible, that is what it would receive from me."

This book, about Alaska, is perhaps my favorite, or at least the one I'd recommend to someone who has never read McPhee before. These days, when everyone seems to have a severely truncated attention span, perhaps McPhee can seem a touch long-winded, but I completely disagree -- I don't think he wastes a sentence. He does write in a pre-internet way, and that, in my opinion, is nothing but good. Read him on paper, not an e-reader, if possible. Even better, take this book in your backpack and head up to Alaska. Perhaps take the public ferry there, out of Bellingham, Washington. It's extremely reasonable. Bring a sleeping bag and sleep on the sundeck, saving your money. You see the same sights as the most expensive cruise ships in the world, and you'll meet some amazing people. Read \"Coming into the Country\" at night. See the northern lights.

The scale and the number of inhabitants of Eagle, AK, and environs is suitably Alaskan, and so alien to what I like, believe, care for, or share that it is astounding how long I spent in that place and still enjoyed myself.

Not this city boy. John McPhee was a Princeton-educated easterner from New Jersey with an interest in preservation and environmental concerns, but also an extraordinary ability to capture peoples with his depiction of their most mundane moments: foraging for food, constructing shelter in the subarctic wild, and even subsisting on public assistance in the extreme northwest fringes of the country. Yet he brings to life an assortment of highly developed real-life characters just living their usual lives under very unusual circumstances. The book is largely sectioned off into accounts of the author's personal travails through the bush north of Fairbanks but south of the North Slope: bears, ptarmigans, graylings, Eskimos, and ice cold glacial rivers. Then the story moves south to the story of site selection for the potential move of the capital from Juneau to Anchorage. Political intrigue, tensions between locals and the state and federal government. Bears. The Anchorage media sought to pressure a move closer to the center of population in the state, while Juneau persisted despite its remote location to the extreme southeast of the state. Finally, the author moves the story to the tiny towns north and east of Fairbanks such as Circle, Eagle, and Tok, where only the hardiest of diehards will brave the extreme winters, and bears, along the Yukon River at minus sixty and seventy below zero. I was amazed and impressed with the honesty and utterly guileless approach the author took to writing of river and bush people who are self-described isolationists. McPhee genuinely loves his subjects and relates their love for the land, despite their eccentricities, gruffness, and the endless cycle of death that pervades the wild. \"You look at this country, it hits you in the face. . . . That life and death are not a duality. They're just simply here--life, death--in the all-pervading mesh that holds things together.\" It's a rare thing to find a pick that captivates each time I pick it up, which reads so fluidly and seamlessly that it's akin to catching up with a longtime acquaintance. I read this book in preparation for an upcoming trip to Alaska, and what I found was a world of wonder unlocked by the narrative of a keen observer who loved those he observed. I am looking forward to my trip."

McPhee divided his exploration of Alaska into three sections--the first, stage-setting section on the northern tree line; the second, uses the search for an ideal site for a new state capital to explore urban Alaska; and the final section, on \"the bush,\" really focuses on the motives and lifestyles of in-migrants to the state. I breezed through the first two parts; the relocation of the state capital (which never happened) in particular was literally a bird's eye view of Alaskan cities and their inhabitants. The third part, however, desperately needed editing: descriptions of grizzly dangers, gold-sluicing methods, and conflicts among resource-hungry and cabin-fevered Yukon inhabitants became monotonous and overly repetitive. McPhee clearly became enamored of the rugged individualists who chose to leave the Lower Forty-eight behind to build lives based on subsistence and skills-building. While his book does not gloss over their less admirable qualities--a tendency toward paranoia, chaos, alchoholism, and particularly misogyny--he comes down firmly for their willingness to pit themselves against nature. Surveying the environmental effects of one gold-mining team's efforts, he writes, \"This pretty little stream is being disassembled in the name of gold.... Am I disgusted? Manifestly not.... This mine is a cork on the sea. Meanwhile (and, possibly more seriously), the relationship between this father and son is as attractive as anything I have seen in Alaska--both of them self-reliant beyond the usual reach of the term, the characteristic formed by this country.\" (410) This celebration of masculine triumph over nature is nothing new, and is disappointing from a writer who can be such a subtle thinker."

Well, maybe geology rocks indeed, but McPhee is where the magic is. A good writer is like a wizard with words. Obviously. “Alaska is a foreign country significantly populated with Americans. Its languages extend to English. Its nature is its own.” Here we get to see 1977 Alaska, which is a beautiful but strange place. A remote and huge expanse of land with competing ideas to apply the frontier approach to it or keep it as preserve of nature for those who have little in the way of pristine nature elsewhere, a place that attracts wilderness enthusiasts and people who’d prefer to be left alone as they make their living in whichever way they please whether they are permitted so or not, those who’d prefer use and exploit and those who wants to conserve, the spirit of individualism and collectivism, and the ever-receding wilderness. All that in the same place and time, and sometimes even in the same people. “They invite a question. To a palate without bias – the palate of an open-minded Berber, the travelling Martian – which would be the more acceptable, a pink-icinged Pop-Tart with raspberry filling (cold) or the fat gob from behind a caribou’s eye?” We see the forests and rivers where bears roam and salmon swim, the tiny remote towns full of tensions and dramas, and the efforts to move the state capital from Juneau to a bunch of other places (the campaign that as we know 50-ish years later ended up unsuccessful). It’s pretty much three books in one - wild Alaska (Salmon River), rural Alaska (Upper Yukon, the settlement of Eagle) and urban Alaska (Juneau, Anchorage). McPhee’s own presence is stronger in this book than in his geology series. He’s here hiking though the wilderness, terrified of bears, taking a canoe down the river, fishing, and hanging out with quite a few characters whose rugged quirks are fascinating. And he shines through the crisp clear prose with sharp vivid observations. The imagery is strong, the descriptions are crystal-clear and fresh and often surprising and wonderfully effective. “Looking over the side of the canoe is like staring down into a sky full of zeppelins.” One thing I got out of this book is that I’m not Alaska material, but enjoying it through McPhee filter was lovely and oftentimes a bit scary. 4 stars. —————— Also posted on my blog ."

The second section was about the attempt to get Alaska's capital moved from Juneau. I now know more about this issue than I ever wanted to. At the end of the section it really sounded like the move was going to come off; people voted and wanted the capital moved to Willow. (This was written in 1977.) But a check of the primary authority on such matters, Wikipedia, shows that Juneau is still the capital, so McPhee must have been stoned or something when he wrote that sentence. In the third section McPhee moved to Eagle, a teeny tiny town on the Yukon River, and pretty much just interviewed the residents of Eagle and told us their stories. Some are interesting; some aren't. (The 2010 census showed the population of Eagle as 86.) In spite of the need for women to be tough in the wilds of Alaska, there are no women's libbers here. The women do all the cookin' and much, much more; wood choppin', skinnin' of critters, waitin' for the menfolk to come a-home from their trips. Maybe a few people sound relatively sane, but most sound a bit crazy. Or a lot crazy. There are your Cliven Bundy types up there. They don't like the people of the lower 48 dictating the rules in Alaska. Alaska is different. People of Alaska, hear me: Alaska is not different. It is a state that in many respects is qualitatively different from, say, Connecticut. It is not legally, Constitutionally, different. Because you build a cabin on a plot of land, trap and hunt your own critters for food, bulldoze yourself a gravel landing strip for your little plane, it does not follow that you now own that land. Don't get all uppity when the Bureau of Land Management comes to tell you you don't actually own that land. You know how I know I own my home? Because I wrote a check; the bank agreed to supply the rest; we had a ceremony (with lawyers for both sides) where we all signed many sheets of paper; and at the end of it one of these sheets of paper was the title and deed to my home. Plus I pay real estate taxes on this home. If the Bureau of Land Management comes to tell me I don't own my home, then we have a problem. You, Alaska trapper and fisher with no title to your little cabin, you don't have a problem. McPhee's writing style wears thin. This was 438 pages of it."

This is so because bushplane trips are more common than taxis or driving, the roads being what they are. -- Fried cranberries will help a sore throat . -- That somethings are better left unchanged or not re-named: \"What would you call that mountain, Willie?\" \"Denali. I'll go along with the Indians that far.\" Everyone aboard was white but Willie (William Igiagruq Hensley), of Arctic Alaska, and he said again, \"Denali. What the hell did McKinley ever do? I learned the difference between a visitor and a tourist in Alaska: A tourist stays a week and drops four hundred dollars. A visitor comes with a shirt and a twenty-dollar bill and doesn't change either one . I learned that Alaska is a great place for nicknames: Pete the Pig, Pistolgrip Jim, Groundsluice Bill, Coolgardie Smith, Codfish Tom, Doc LaBooze, the Evaporated Kid, Fisty McDonald, John the Baptist, Cheeseham Sam, and the Man with the Big Nugget. I actually came across a Codfish in my own travels, but I have an odd job. I learned that bear scat is \"fairly, but not acutely fresh\" when it \"glistens but has stopped smoking.\" Not everything I learned will I actually use. I learned that Alaska, at least the Alaska of 1977, was a place where people, tired of government and other people, fled to. I learned that the government followed them there and refused to let them alone. I learned that Alaskans are prone to a philosophy: LIVE EACH DAY SO THAT YOU CAN LOOK EVERY DAMN MAN IN THE EYE AND TELL HIM TO GO TO HELL. We need such people. At least we need a place where such people could go. A place I might go if it wasn't so cold. A place so vast and unpeopled that if anyone could figure out how to steal Italy, Alaska would be a place to hide it . This was another wonderful trip that John McPhee took me on. It's dated, to be sure. But wonderful characters are portrayed; good stories told. In the battle between independent, brave individuals and a pedantic, fuzzy-wuzzy government, John McPhee leaves no doubt whose side he is on."

        "text":"A year or two out of college I was employed at a bookshop in Seattle, earning little more than minimum wage. For a change of scene, I signed up with some friends to work the salmon season at a cannery in Alaska. It was rough work, seven days a week, 8am to 11pm (or to 1am on nights when you had cleanup duty). We didn’t get to see much of “real Alaska,” but you could feel it around you. The wilderness. The cannery was located on an island in the southeast of the state. The town was small for anyplace other than Alaska, with not much more than a single road. The rest of the island was uninhabited. People wandering into the interior were sometimes never heard from again. No one went in search of them. It was assumed the wolves or bears had got them. The moss and muskeg would hide their bones. Though I saw little of Alaska, it was enough to grasp its fascination. If my sense of it had faded some over the past twenty years, McPhee’s wonderful book has helped to revive it. I suddenly find myself scheming ways to get the wife and kids up north on vacation as soon as possible. One of my college professors first introduced me to John McPhee. It was a writing course, and he was reading brief passages from one of McPhee’s books (I don’t recall which one), lingering over certain passages and expostulating on the genius of his prose, his crystalline expressions. McPhee is rarely flashy. There is no false posturing. He is curious, broad, but crisp, fresh, clear. My former favorite of McPhee’s books (among those I have read) was Basin and Range , but Coming into the Country is just as good. The first part of it follows McPhee on an outing in the total wild of the Brooks Range. The second has to do with the politics of the state circa 1977. The third, and by far the longest, is the best. In it, McPhee lives with and among the trappers, the miners, the townspeople, the hippie kids and the Athapaskan natives of the Yukon River country near the Canadian border. In this small but broadly scattered and loose-knit community, McPhee finds all the hope, discontent and anxiety of the human condition. It’s a parable (perhaps) of the riddling complexities that face us today, finding ourselves to be a part of the natural order and yet standing, somehow, outside of it."

We were in Newfoundland a year ago, a lovely holiday and upon the world's most uncomfortable couch I found reruns of Northern Exposure. I loved the show back in its heyday. It appeared apt, especially the episode where on Thanksgiving the First nation people through tomatoes at the white people. A few months after that, we returned from Serbia to discover that Amazon Prime now had all of Northern Exposure in its content vault. I then viewed every episode. Thus, I was intrigued by McPhee's description of the eccentrics who leave the \"Lower 48\" and venture north. There are three sections, the first dealing with a canoe and kayak trip rife with conversation about conservation and bear attacks. The second details urban Alaska and political tensions; this crystallized in ballot measure to move the state capitol. The final section is a series of portraits which in juxtaposition create an Alaskan mesh, forever in disunion. Was I ever disappointed! Perhaps the blame should rest with me, if only partially. I just recoiled from the arrogance, intentional or not. I enjoyed the sections detailing bush pilots but disliked nearly everything else."

        "text":"2023 - ‘70’s Immersion Reading Challenge Coming Into the Country: A remarkable voyage of spirit and mind into America’s last great wilderness - Alaska by John McPhee (1976; 1979 ed.) 417 pages. If you are from Alaska, then you are definitely going to want to read this book. Alaska was going through huge progressive changes in the 1970’s. The author smoothly interweaves a bit of history and politics with interviews of the natives, especially in and around Eagle, which was the first incorporated town of interior Alaska situated on the Yukon River. In the ’70’s, Alaska was in its third gold boom and now the oil boom. The U.S. government was moving in and changing the climate in Alaska. The author, from New Jersey, traveled to Alaska to feel and experience the last wild piece of America, and to interview these locals and natives to get their feelings about the changes taking place. This book is divided into three sections: The Encircled River , What They Were Hunting For , and Coming Into the Country . (1) The Encircled River McPhee and four other guys, who worked for the U.S. government, began a canoe and kayak expedition at the head of the 60 mile long Salmon River in the Brooks Range that runs through the Baird Mountains in Kobuk Valley National Park, Alaska. It is the most northern river above the Arctic Circle. Their purpose was to study the river as a national wild river that Congress would be voting on the following year, 1978, to become part of the Kobuk Valley National Monument, along with 15 other millions of acreages they were to vote on for national parks. The natives would soon have to accept the idea of now owning property and having boundaries; whereas, before they were roamers, following the herds of moose and caribou. The legislation passed under Jimmy Carter on December 2, 1980. McPhee learned from his adventuring guides, that it takes money to go into the bush to hunt and fish. These men moved to Alaska only to find their dreams of hunting or fishing squashed because the reality of it is you need lots of money to charter planes out to areas where the fish, moose and caribou even exist. (2) What They Were Hunting For What they were hunting for back in the 1970’s was a new place to move the capital from Juneau, which had been the state capital since 1906. There were no roads into Juneau. One had to hire a bush pilot and fly in. McPhee flew around with the committee in charge to scout out the three possible sites for the new capital: Lake Larson, Mount Yenlo, and Willow, which all three would have been more centrally located between the two rival cities of Anchorage and Fairbanks, but much closer to Anchorage. Willow won the vote and construction was supposed to begin in 1980. (p. 169) The author didn’t know at the time, when the book was published in 1977, that the capital of Alaska would not be moved in 1980 because here it is year 2023 and Juneau is still the capital, and, by the way, you still have to charter flights into the city. This section of the book gives interesting insight into the steps the Alaskan government took to try and change it….and the expense, into the millions of dollars spent, just to try and find a suitable place that never panned out. (3) Coming into the Country The upper Yukon is referred to as “the country”. A stranger arriving up there is said to have “come into the country”. (p. 175) This part of the book is the longest and is all about the native locals who live and survive on the Yukon River, in and around Eagle. The author stayed at the homes of these natives and participated with them in gold digging, hunting and hiking expeditions, while getting their views on the progressive changes taking place in Alaska. He gives great insight into the lives of these people and their environment, with a little history, on Eagle. The hard truth about living “in the country” of Alaska… A lot of these people who keep coming into the country don’t belong here. They have fallen in love with a calendar photo and they want to live under a beautiful mountain. When they arrive the reality doesn’t match the dream. It’s too much for them. They don’t want to work hard enough; they don’t want to spread out – to go far enough up the streams. (Richard Okey “Dick” Cook, came into the country in 1964 from Lyndhurst, Ohio, p. 253) Page 410 tells of the authors own struggles to pick sides. He enjoys the beautiful national parks and wildlife refuges….and I do too. I’m so glad we have them. At the same time, I do realize that progress, and even just the preservation of land, comes with a double-edged sword, putting an end to one way of life for another. Many of the natives are implementing, and prefer using, modern tools and equipment (aluminum boats with their Evinrude motors, ski-doos, fuel, guns, purchased rations, and, of course, government subsidies). And because of this, they are forced into taking jobs in the bigger cities, away from their families, for a season to make money to pay for those conveniences they have come to depend on. That’s part of the payoff! ——————————————— INTERESTING FACTS ALASKA NATIVE CLAIMS SETTLEMENT ACT OF 1971 Alaska was purchased from Russia for $7.2 million in 1867, but didn’t become a state until 1959. It wasn’t until 1971 when the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act gave the natives (Eskimos, Indians and Aleuts) one billion dollars and 44 million acres of land. A lot of this land, as we now know today, contained gold, silver, other minerals and oil and gas rights, which they were and would be able to profit from. (p. 145) A much different situation compared to how the natives were treated previously in the lower 48. HOMESTEADING IN ALASKA In the 1862 Homestead Act, homesteaders were given 160 acres, free of charge, for coming to Alaska. They had to live on the property for three years, build a dwelling to live in and grow a crop on an eighth of the land (p. 161), but that deal ended in 1974…according to this author. But, another source online states the 1862 Homestead Act officially ended on October 21, 1976 with a 10-year extension for Alaska. The last free, 160-acre homestead was claimed on October 21, 1986. (U.S. Department of the Interior Bureau of Land Management: “History of Alaska Homesteading”, ) But, even after the homestead act ended, it appears people would still go and build small cabins deep into the interior Alaska, believing they had staked a claim to a piece of Alaska, and little was ever mentioned. But, if oil was discovered on the land, or even nearby, the U.S. Government would send officials through the area on helicopters to dish out eviction notices, and it didn’t matter how long you had been established there. (p. 232-33, 236) The State of Alaska had until 1984 to finish choosing its 103 million acres, which much was in the way of parks, government forests, wildlife refuges, huge petroleum reserves in the north, and the 44 million acres appropriated to natives. There wasn’t much land left for squatters, or want-to-be-homesteaders, to sneak in a cabin anywhere. (p. 234) GOLD IN ALASKA (1) 1890’s - $17\/oz. (2) 1934 - Government set price at $35\/oz. (3) 1970’s - for first time gold was allowed to float with the market and Americans were allowed to buy and keep gold. It rose to nearly $200\/oz., settling to $150\/oz. (p. 219) Today, n 2023, the price of gold is $1,832\/oz., fluctuating with the daily market (Forbes Advisor at Forbes.com online website). Recreational gold panning is still allowed on public lands, such as national forest, wildlife refuges, some state parks, national parks (higher restrictions), lands administrated by the Bureau of Land Management and the State of Alaska. To determine if an area is open to mineral entry and if there are legal mining claims in an area, contact the state Division of Mining or, for claims on federal lands, the Bureau of Land Management. Once you have determined land status, know that it is public land, that it is open to mineral entry, and that it has no legal claims, check with the managing agency to determine what restrictions might be in force. (Recreational Gold Mining in Alaska @ myalaskan.com, accessed 3\/3\/2023) For gold panning on private property, you must have owners permission. For the use of any heavy equipment, you must have a permit."

        "text":"This book has meant a lot to me as an Alaskan interested in the raggedy interplay between development and conservationism, although I had never read it in its entirety. Now I have. I would say this book at best offers a kind, sympathetic view of all sorts of Alaskans circa 1977, a period which I just barely remember from grade school. I still recall the statewide debate on whether to give \"Mount McKinley\" the new\/old name of \"Denali\" as part of ANILCA, then called the D-2 Lands Bill, which was a hot-button topic (i.e. federal take-over) for Alaskans such as my parents. I remember the debate to move the capital to Willow. I remember John Denver's goodwill trip to Alaska to promote conservation and the passage of ANILCA. It was all HIGHLY charged politics in which the feds were dabbling, playing, frivolizing with OUR land. The outgrowth of both the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act and the Alaska National Interest Land Conservation Act are INCREDIBLY far reaching with regards to living and working in Alaska today. In that respect, the first two chapters of the book are now dated and rather nostalgic, kind of a time-capsule of what was going on while these landmark Congressional laws were being sussed out. The chapter \"Coming Into The Country\" (nearly half of the book) on the Yukon River\/Charley River area of Interior Alaska was by far the best part of the book, focusing on the communities of Central, Circle, and Eagle and the idealistic, sometimes hard-nosed characters that live there. Although McPhee, in what I've read, was an impressionable young man leaning to the side of environmental conservation at the expense of economic development, I think his writing in this book shows both a reverence for Alaska's brand of wilderness (in a word, awesome) as well as a sympathetic, humane perspective on the toll that Congressional protectionism, environmental regulation, and romantic idealism has on the lives of real families living in \"the country\". (The best writing is the transcription of journal entries made by a young man, Rich Corazza, living alone in a cabin somewhere around Eagle. This section is one third into the last section \"Coming Into The Country\" and made me grin and laugh out loud. A true seeker with a good dose of humor and longing.)"

        "text":"“If anyone could figure out how to steal Italy, Alaska would be the place to hid it.\" What a vivid way to describe Alaska's immensity. 'There has been a host of excellent books on Alaska. My favorite until recently was Joe McGinnis's Going to Extremes but John McPhee's Coming Into the Country is wonderful, too. McPhee's book is divided into three parts: first an exploration of wilderness described during the course of a canoe\/kayak trip down the Salmon River. Much in the manner of the river, his descriptions meander into all sorts of eddies and whirlpools. His description of bush pilots is priceless. On one occasion he is flying (a regularly scheduled airline, mind you) in a single engine plane in horrible weather. The pilot is skimming the trees to find landmarks because he can't see anything. He has a map on his lap, but suddenly hands it to a passenger to help figure out where they are. \"I had been chewing gum so vigorously that the hinges of my jaws would ache for two days.\" Stumbling on a grizzly bear in a blueberry patch (fortunately upwind), he muses on the best way to survive a grizzly's charge - no consensus of opinion, but most survivors believe the best thing to do is stand absolutely still and shout as loudly as possible, for that is the least likely reaction the bear, which does not have good sight, would expect of game. Running away is useless for grizzlies are very fast. They are also quite coordinated. They enjoy schussing down snow-covered mountains at 96 feet\/second through trees and around boulders only to screech to a stop, stand up and walk away, just before going -over the edge of a cliff. The second part of the book discusses the Alaskan government's search for a new capital and the conflict that generated. Juneau really makes a lousy site because of its remoteness, not to mention its horrible landing approach to the airport. Alaska attracts very independent and anti-authoritarian types of people so it witnesses a battle between those suffering from the \"Sierra Club Syndrome\" or others fondly embracing the \"Dallas Scenario.\" Many of these folks are affectionately profiled in the third section. John Cook, for example, has consciously tried to eliminate the need for money and authority. He tries to live on $1,500 a year (this was written in the mid seventies); he has a series of trap line s and rarely uses a parka, even at -30'. The closest town is Eagle, about 30 miles away via dog sled, with a population of about 100. Almost all live by the ut restrictions on code, \"Never put restrictions on any individual.... Up here they ain't gettin' you for spittin' on the sidewalk.\" Ironically, most moved there for the space, yet land is less available (as of 1977) than in the lower '48 because when Alaska became a state deals were made with the native Americans and the federal government to set aside almost the entire state as either a reservation or park land. Whereas before statehood someone could build a cabin 80 miles from nowhere, now a government helicopter might fly over and throw them out. Homesteading no longer exists, but in Alaska that loss seems especially poignant in territory where you might have to fly somewhere to take a shower."

So this is the third time I've read it. I've read maybe ten books three times, so I really, really like this. First, because McPhee writes so beautifully. He could write about anything and I would read it. I've even read his geology books. Not because I like geology, (I don't), but because I just eat up his words. It is like eating chocolate, I usually stop when the supply runs out, not because I'm finished. Second, the people and the spirit that makes up Alaska. Everything is so unbelievably huge. I love the stories about people who cut tractors up into pieces, fly them to remote regions, weld them back together so they can build an airstrip for a bigger plane. Third, the Alaska he writes about was disappearing when he wrote it, and has been replaced with at least two generations of Alaska since then. I will be visiting Alaska this summer and I am looking forward to seeing what's new and what remains of the old. Will it be strip malls? I'll let you know."

        "text":"This book is a somewhat lengthy discussion of three different aspects of Alaskan existence.  Although I have traveled to Alaska, I must admit that I am not very knowledgeable about its ways, although I have a few friends who have lived there and could probably have more to say about the sorts of deep divisions that Alaskan society has.  I must say, though, that in general much of the sort of division shown here is something that I can relate to as someone with a generally strong knowledge of the divisiveness of life in rural America and the wellspring of ambivalence there is about government and identity in many parts of the United States outside of the big cities.  Alaska does seem, at least in this book, to be a very small world, and small worlds have a great degree of similarity in that they bring out the pettiness and fractiousness of people to a greater extent than is evident when one looks only at human beings en masse.  If this book was definitely not my favorite by the author, it certainly provided, as always, an entertaining look at people the author happens to be spending a lot of time with. This nearly 450 page book is divided into three parts that explore different aspects of the Alaskan experience.  In the first book, \"The Encircled River,\" the author goes on an adventurous kayak adventure in one of Alaska's many Salmon Rivers, surrounded by the Brooks Range in northern Alaska and dealing with people as varied as forest Eskimos and government employees who want to protect large swaths of Alaskan wilderness as well as the possibility of harm from Alaska's massive grizzlies.  The second book, \"What They Were Hunting For,\" is a rather grim and self-absorbed look at Alaskans hunting for a location for a new state capital, arguing about the dominance of Anchorage, and demonstrating a distinct lack of interest in the rest of the world outside of their large but remote state, which at times almost seems like foreign territory for all it knows or cares of the lower 48.  Finally, the third book, \"Coming Into The Country,\" examines the divisions and rivalries among a group of people who have mostly left behind their life in the lower 48 and come to live in Alaska seeking homesteads, quarreling with the government while sometimes seeking public aid, and worried about politics and religion and questions of identity. Indeed, as a whole this particular book demonstrates the ferocity of identity questions when one looks at Alaska.  A wide variety of people seek very different things in coming to Alaska, including space from others even while remaining dependent on logistical chains going to larger cities, political power in a small world where it does not take much to be a big fish (and this even before Sarah Palin), and a desire to create a somewhat anarchical society with little money that is funded by government largess due to the oil wealth there, as well as an unspoiled wilderness free of anyone but themselves to sort out boundaries and questions of who deserves the landfalls to be received from the exploitation of the Alaskan wilderness and its resources.  I must admit that I do not find the Alaskans to be all that different from the people I grew up around, and I was pleased to find so many interested in books despite the difficulties of collecting books in such remote territory.  If Alaska is a bit cold and remote for my tastes, the tensions of Alaskan society are only slightly more exaggerated than those of most rural areas in the American west or south, for similar reasons of colonialism."

        "text":"McPhee's Coming Into the Country is rightly considered a classic with its detailed description on life in mid-1970s Alaska. Much of the writing is stunning, packed full of river trips and anecdotes about characters the author encountered during his many months in the country. He captures well the contradictions embodied in many Alaskans: a thirst for solitude alternating with a an affinity for social gatherings, an abhorrence of government even as they live and trap on public land, and the sparse population combined with a sense that there are few places left to go, live, and be free. McPhee's writing style full of rapid fire quotes summing up various points of view is effective in conveying these contradictions. He also captures an important transitional time in the state's history when the Trans-Alaskan oil pipeline and the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act were new realities. Read nearly 40 years after it was published, I believe the book reflects an important historical slice of Alaskan culture. Despite the overall high quality of writing, I found that some parts dragged (I found myself skimming dozens of pages related to a possible shift of Alaska's capital city from Juneau to parts unknown). If 4.5 stars were possible, that is what it would receive from me."

This book, about Alaska, is perhaps my favorite, or at least the one I'd recommend to someone who has never read McPhee before.

He does write in a pre-internet way, and that, in my opinion, is nothing but good. Read him on paper, not an e-reader, if possible. Even better, take this book in your backpack and head up to Alaska. Perhaps take the public ferry there, out of Bellingham, Washington. It's extremely reasonable. Bring a sleeping bag and sleep on the sundeck, saving your money. You see the same sights as the most expensive cruise ships in the world, and you'll meet some amazing people. Read \"Coming into the Country\" at night. See the northern lights. Feel goosebumps all over. Change your life forever. That's what I did, and I haven't regretted it for a moment."

This book is written for folks like myself, that are obsessed with the ideal of living in Alaska, of getting away from it all, of the dream of escaping from a corrupt country, into a country that while in America, is definitely not of America. McPhee has some of the most wonderful prose I have ever read, and he tackles with it the three frontiers, all wild to different degrees: the political, the conservational, and the individual. The individual frontier being the most fascinating of all as he paints a living picture of the type of men that \"don't fit in\"."

My favorite part is probably the first--\"The Encircled River\"--which is literally a textbook example of how to write a travel narrative, with a grizzly at each end. The middle part is sly political commentary, but the last and longest part is what McPhee is always doing: introducing you to people and arranging that you see the world from their eyes, even when they can't do that for each other. The scale and the number of inhabitants of Eagle, AK, and environs is suitably Alaskan, and so alien to what I like, believe, care for, or share that it is astounding how long I spent in that place and still enjoyed myself. It's always McPhee, without a wristwatch, terrified of grizzlies, and listening loudly that makes this work. Recommended for social distancing."

I have enjoyed many of his pieces, and this one is pretty good too. If I have any qualms, it might be that he is a tad repetitive and some of the information was perhaps a bit more than I wanted to hear about. I think it could easily have been a hundred pages trimmed, but I guess you can always skip past things if you wanted to.

The book is essentially broken into three sections - one is a group of men out canoeing, fishing, camping, one is about the debate about moving the capital of Alaska out of Juneau, and one is McPhee’s experiences when he moved to a town of 86 and spent his time learning about the residents and their stories.

        "text":"Who would have thought an anthropological, almost ethnographic, account of the author's time spent in the nation's Last Frontier, the great North of Alaska, just a handful of years after its admission to the Union as the 49th state, would be so wholly engaging. Not this city boy. John McPhee was a Princeton-educated easterner from New Jersey with an interest in preservation and environmental concerns, but also an extraordinary ability to capture peoples with his depiction of their most mundane moments: foraging for food, constructing shelter in the subarctic wild, and even subsisting on public assistance in the extreme northwest fringes of the country. Yet he brings to life an assortment of highly developed real-life characters just living their usual lives under very unusual circumstances. The book is largely sectioned off into accounts of the author's personal travails through the bush north of Fairbanks but south of the North Slope: bears, ptarmigans, graylings, Eskimos, and ice cold glacial rivers. Then the story moves south to the story of site selection for the potential move of the capital from Juneau to Anchorage. Political intrigue, tensions between locals and the state and federal government. Bears. The Anchorage media sought to pressure a move closer to the center of population in the state, while Juneau persisted despite its remote location to the extreme southeast of the state. Finally, the author moves the story to the tiny towns north and east of Fairbanks such as Circle, Eagle, and Tok, where only the hardiest of diehards will brave the extreme winters, and bears, along the Yukon River at minus sixty and seventy below zero. I was amazed and impressed with the honesty and utterly guileless approach the author took to writing of river and bush people who are self-described isolationists. McPhee genuinely loves his subjects and relates their love for the land, despite their eccentricities, gruffness, and the endless cycle of death that pervades the wild. \"You look at this country, it hits you in the face. . . . That life and death are not a duality. They're just simply here--life, death--in the all-pervading mesh that holds things together.\" It's a rare thing to find a pick that captivates each time I pick it up, which reads so fluidly and seamlessly that it's akin to catching up with a longtime acquaintance. I read this book in preparation for an upcoming trip to Alaska, and what I found was a world of wonder unlocked by the narrative of a keen observer who loved those he observed. I am looking forward to my trip."

        "text":"This book was a challenge for me. McPhee divided his exploration of Alaska into three sections--the first, stage-setting section on the northern tree line; the second, uses the search for an ideal site for a new state capital to explore urban Alaska; and the final section, on \"the bush,\" really focuses on the motives and lifestyles of in-migrants to the state. I breezed through the first two parts; the relocation of the state capital (which never happened) in particular was literally a bird's eye view of Alaskan cities and their inhabitants. The third part, however, desperately needed editing: descriptions of grizzly dangers, gold-sluicing methods, and conflicts among resource-hungry and cabin-fevered Yukon inhabitants became monotonous and overly repetitive. McPhee clearly became enamored of the rugged individualists who chose to leave the Lower Forty-eight behind to build lives based on subsistence and skills-building. While his book does not gloss over their less admirable qualities--a tendency toward paranoia, chaos, alchoholism, and particularly misogyny--he comes down firmly for their willingness to pit themselves against nature. Surveying the environmental effects of one gold-mining team's efforts, he writes, \"This pretty little stream is being disassembled in the name of gold.... Am I disgusted? Manifestly not.... This mine is a cork on the sea. Meanwhile (and, possibly more seriously), the relationship between this father and son is as attractive as anything I have seen in Alaska--both of them self-reliant beyond the usual reach of the term, the characteristic formed by this country.\" (410) This celebration of masculine triumph over nature is nothing new, and is disappointing from a writer who can be such a subtle thinker."

Well, maybe geology rocks indeed, but McPhee is where the magic is. A good writer is like a wizard with words. Obviously. “Alaska is a foreign country significantly populated with Americans. Its languages extend to English. Its nature is its own.” Here we get to see 1977 Alaska, which is a beautiful but strange place. A remote and huge expanse of land with competing ideas to apply the frontier approach to it or keep it as preserve of nature for those who have little in the way of pristine nature elsewhere, a place that attracts wilderness enthusiasts and people who’d prefer to be left alone as they make their living in whichever way they please whether they are permitted so or not, those who’d prefer use and exploit and those who wants to conserve, the spirit of individualism and collectivism, and the ever-receding wilderness. All that in the same place and time, and sometimes even in the same people. “They invite a question. To a palate without bias – the palate of an open-minded Berber, the travelling Martian – which would be the more acceptable, a pink-icinged Pop-Tart with raspberry filling (cold) or the fat gob from behind a caribou’s eye?” We see the forests and rivers where bears roam and salmon swim, the tiny remote towns full of tensions and dramas, and the efforts to move the state capital from Juneau to a bunch of other places (the campaign that as we know 50-ish years later ended up unsuccessful). It’s pretty much three books in one - wild Alaska (Salmon River), rural Alaska (Upper Yukon, the settlement of Eagle) and urban Alaska (Juneau, Anchorage). McPhee’s own presence is stronger in this book than in his geology series. He’s here hiking though the wilderness, terrified of bears, taking a canoe down the river, fishing, and hanging out with quite a few characters whose rugged quirks are fascinating. And he shines through the crisp clear prose with sharp vivid observations. The imagery is strong, the descriptions are crystal-clear and fresh and often surprising and wonderfully effective. “Looking over the side of the canoe is like staring down into a sky full of zeppelins.” One thing I got out of this book is that I’m not Alaska material, but enjoying it through McPhee filter was lovely and oftentimes a bit scary. 4 stars. —————— Also posted on my blog ."

It's divided into three sections; in the first, McPhee wanders around unpopulated Alaska with several other men in several canoes\/kayaks. I think one was from the Sierra Club, one from the Bureau of Land Management, etc. They fished to supplement their food supplies, and camped along the rivers and streams. The second section was about the attempt to get Alaska's capital moved from Juneau. I now know more about this issue than I ever wanted to. At the end of the section it really sounded like the move was going to come off; people voted and wanted the capital moved to Willow. (This was written in 1977.) But a check of the primary authority on such matters, Wikipedia, shows that Juneau is still the capital, so McPhee must have been stoned or something when he wrote that sentence. In the third section McPhee moved to Eagle, a teeny tiny town on the Yukon River, and pretty much just interviewed the residents of Eagle and told us their stories. Some are interesting; some aren't. (The 2010 census showed the population of Eagle as 86.) In spite of the need for women to be tough in the wilds of Alaska, there are no women's libbers here. The women do all the cookin' and much, much more; wood choppin', skinnin' of critters, waitin' for the menfolk to come a-home from their trips. Maybe a few people sound relatively sane, but most sound a bit crazy. Or a lot crazy. There are your Cliven Bundy types up there. They don't like the people of the lower 48 dictating the rules in Alaska. Alaska is different. People of Alaska, hear me: Alaska is not different. It is a state that in many respects is qualitatively different from, say, Connecticut. It is not legally, Constitutionally, different. Because you build a cabin on a plot of land, trap and hunt your own critters for food, bulldoze yourself a gravel landing strip for your little plane, it does not follow that you now own that land. Don't get all uppity when the Bureau of Land Management comes to tell you you don't actually own that land. You know how I know I own my home? Because I wrote a check; the bank agreed to supply the rest; we had a ceremony (with lawyers for both sides) where we all signed many sheets of paper; and at the end of it one of these sheets of paper was the title and deed to my home. Plus I pay real estate taxes on this home. If the Bureau of Land Management comes to tell me I don't own my home, then we have a problem. You, Alaska trapper and fisher with no title to your little cabin, you don't have a problem. McPhee's writing style wears thin. This was 438 pages of it."

I actually came across a Codfish in my own travels, but I have an odd job. I learned that bear scat is \"fairly, but not acutely fresh\" when it \"glistens but has stopped smoking.\" Not everything I learned will I actually use. I learned that Alaska, at least the Alaska of 1977, was a place where people, tired of government and other people, fled to. I learned that the government followed them there and refused to let them alone. I learned that Alaskans are prone to a philosophy: LIVE EACH DAY SO THAT YOU CAN LOOK EVERY DAMN MAN IN THE EYE AND TELL HIM TO GO TO HELL. We need such people. At least we need a place where such people could go. A place I might go if it wasn't so cold. A place so vast and unpeopled that if anyone could figure out how to steal Italy, Alaska would be a place to hide it . This was another wonderful trip that John McPhee took me on. It's dated, to be sure. But wonderful characters are portrayed; good stories told.

For a change of scene, I signed up with some friends to work the salmon season at a cannery in Alaska. It was rough work, seven days a week, 8am to 11pm (or to 1am on nights when you had cleanup duty). We didn’t get to see much of “real Alaska,” but you could feel it around you. The wilderness. The cannery was located on an island in the southeast of the state. The town was small for anyplace other than Alaska, with not much more than a single road. The rest of the island was uninhabited. People wandering into the interior were sometimes never heard from again. No one went in search of them. It was assumed the wolves or bears had got them. The moss and muskeg would hide their bones. Though I saw little of Alaska, it was enough to grasp its fascination. If my sense of it had faded some over the past twenty years, McPhee’s wonderful book has helped to revive it. I suddenly find myself scheming ways to get the wife and kids up north on vacation as soon as possible. One of my college professors first introduced me to John McPhee. It was a writing course, and he was reading brief passages from one of McPhee’s books (I don’t recall which one), lingering over certain passages and expostulating on the genius of his prose, his crystalline expressions. McPhee is rarely flashy. There is no false posturing. He is curious, broad, but crisp, fresh, clear. My former favorite of McPhee’s books (among those I have read) was Basin and Range , but Coming into the Country is just as good. The first part of it follows McPhee on an outing in the total wild of the Brooks Range. The second has to do with the politics of the state circa 1977. The third, and by far the longest, is the best. In it, McPhee lives with and among the trappers, the miners, the townspeople, the hippie kids and the Athapaskan natives of the Yukon River country near the Canadian border. In this small but broadly scattered and loose-knit community, McPhee finds all the hope, discontent and anxiety of the human condition. It’s a parable (perhaps) of the riddling complexities that face us today, finding ourselves to be a part of the natural order and yet standing, somehow, outside of it."

        "text":"2023 - ‘70’s Immersion Reading Challenge Coming Into the Country: A remarkable voyage of spirit and mind into America’s last great wilderness - Alaska by John McPhee (1976; 1979 ed.) 417 pages. If you are from Alaska, then you are definitely going to want to read this book. Alaska was going through huge progressive changes in the 1970’s. The author smoothly interweaves a bit of history and politics with interviews of the natives, especially in and around Eagle, which was the first incorporated town of interior Alaska situated on the Yukon River. In the ’70’s, Alaska was in its third gold boom and now the oil boom. The U.S. government was moving in and changing the climate in Alaska. The author, from New Jersey, traveled to Alaska to feel and experience the last wild piece of America, and to interview these locals and natives to get their feelings about the changes taking place. This book is divided into three sections: The Encircled River , What They Were Hunting For , and Coming Into the Country . (1) The Encircled River McPhee and four other guys, who worked for the U.S. government, began a canoe and kayak expedition at the head of the 60 mile long Salmon River in the Brooks Range that runs through the Baird Mountains in Kobuk Valley National Park, Alaska. It is the most northern river above the Arctic Circle. Their purpose was to study the river as a national wild river that Congress would be voting on the following year, 1978, to become part of the Kobuk Valley National Monument, along with 15 other millions of acreages they were to vote on for national parks. The natives would soon have to accept the idea of now owning property and having boundaries; whereas, before they were roamers, following the herds of moose and caribou. The legislation passed under Jimmy Carter on December 2, 1980. McPhee learned from his adventuring guides, that it takes money to go into the bush to hunt and fish. These men moved to Alaska only to find their dreams of hunting or fishing squashed because the reality of it is you need lots of money to charter planes out to areas where the fish, moose and caribou even exist. (2) What They Were Hunting For What they were hunting for back in the 1970’s was a new place to move the capital from Juneau, which had been the state capital since 1906. There were no roads into Juneau. One had to hire a bush pilot and fly in. McPhee flew around with the committee in charge to scout out the three possible sites for the new capital: Lake Larson, Mount Yenlo, and Willow, which all three would have been more centrally located between the two rival cities of Anchorage and Fairbanks, but much closer to Anchorage. Willow won the vote and construction was supposed to begin in 1980. (p. 169) The author didn’t know at the time, when the book was published in 1977, that the capital of Alaska would not be moved in 1980 because here it is year 2023 and Juneau is still the capital, and, by the way, you still have to charter flights into the city. This section of the book gives interesting insight into the steps the Alaskan government took to try and change it….and the expense, into the millions of dollars spent, just to try and find a suitable place that never panned out. (3) Coming into the Country The upper Yukon is referred to as “the country”. A stranger arriving up there is said to have “come into the country”. (p. 175) This part of the book is the longest and is all about the native locals who live and survive on the Yukon River, in and around Eagle. The author stayed at the homes of these natives and participated with them in gold digging, hunting and hiking expeditions, while getting their views on the progressive changes taking place in Alaska. He gives great insight into the lives of these people and their environment, with a little history, on Eagle. The hard truth about living “in the country” of Alaska… A lot of these people who keep coming into the country don’t belong here. They have fallen in love with a calendar photo and they want to live under a beautiful mountain. When they arrive the reality doesn’t match the dream. It’s too much for them. They don’t want to work hard enough; they don’t want to spread out – to go far enough up the streams. (Richard Okey “Dick” Cook, came into the country in 1964 from Lyndhurst, Ohio, p. 253) Page 410 tells of the authors own struggles to pick sides. He enjoys the beautiful national parks and wildlife refuges….and I do too. I’m so glad we have them. At the same time, I do realize that progress, and even just the preservation of land, comes with a double-edged sword, putting an end to one way of life for another. Many of the natives are implementing, and prefer using, modern tools and equipment (aluminum boats with their Evinrude motors, ski-doos, fuel, guns, purchased rations, and, of course, government subsidies). And because of this, they are forced into taking jobs in the bigger cities, away from their families, for a season to make money to pay for those conveniences they have come to depend on. That’s part of the payoff! ——————————————— INTERESTING FACTS ALASKA NATIVE CLAIMS SETTLEMENT ACT OF 1971 Alaska was purchased from Russia for $7.2 million in 1867, but didn’t become a state until 1959. It wasn’t until 1971 when the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act gave the natives (Eskimos, Indians and Aleuts) one billion dollars and 44 million acres of land. A lot of this land, as we now know today, contained gold, silver, other minerals and oil and gas rights, which they were and would be able to profit from. (p. 145) A much different situation compared to how the natives were treated previously in the lower 48. HOMESTEADING IN ALASKA In the 1862 Homestead Act, homesteaders were given 160 acres, free of charge, for coming to Alaska. They had to live on the property for three years, build a dwelling to live in and grow a crop on an eighth of the land (p. 161), but that deal ended in 1974…according to this author. But, another source online states the 1862 Homestead Act officially ended on October 21, 1976 with a 10-year extension for Alaska. The last free, 160-acre homestead was claimed on October 21, 1986. (U.S. Department of the Interior Bureau of Land Management: “History of Alaska Homesteading”, ) But, even after the homestead act ended, it appears people would still go and build small cabins deep into the interior Alaska, believing they had staked a claim to a piece of Alaska, and little was ever mentioned. But, if oil was discovered on the land, or even nearby, the U.S. Government would send officials through the area on helicopters to dish out eviction notices, and it didn’t matter how long you had been established there. (p. 232-33, 236) The State of Alaska had until 1984 to finish choosing its 103 million acres, which much was in the way of parks, government forests, wildlife refuges, huge petroleum reserves in the north, and the 44 million acres appropriated to natives. There wasn’t much land left for squatters, or want-to-be-homesteaders, to sneak in a cabin anywhere. (p. 234) GOLD IN ALASKA (1) 1890’s - $17\/oz. (2) 1934 - Government set price at $35\/oz. (3) 1970’s - for first time gold was allowed to float with the market and Americans were allowed to buy and keep gold. It rose to nearly $200\/oz., settling to $150\/oz. (p. 219) Today, n 2023, the price of gold is $1,832\/oz., fluctuating with the daily market (Forbes Advisor at Forbes.com online website). Recreational gold panning is still allowed on public lands, such as national forest, wildlife refuges, some state parks, national parks (higher restrictions), lands administrated by the Bureau of Land Management and the State of Alaska. To determine if an area is open to mineral entry and if there are legal mining claims in an area, contact the state Division of Mining or, for claims on federal lands, the Bureau of Land Management. Once you have determined land status, know that it is public land, that it is open to mineral entry, and that it has no legal claims, check with the managing agency to determine what restrictions might be in force. (Recreational Gold Mining in Alaska @ myalaskan.com, accessed 3\/3\/2023) For gold panning on private property, you must have owners permission. For the use of any heavy equipment, you must have a permit."

        "text":"This book has meant a lot to me as an Alaskan interested in the raggedy interplay between development and conservationism, although I had never read it in its entirety. Now I have. I would say this book at best offers a kind, sympathetic view of all sorts of Alaskans circa 1977, a period which I just barely remember from grade school. I still recall the statewide debate on whether to give \"Mount McKinley\" the new\/old name of \"Denali\" as part of ANILCA, then called the D-2 Lands Bill, which was a hot-button topic (i.e. federal take-over) for Alaskans such as my parents. I remember the debate to move the capital to Willow. I remember John Denver's goodwill trip to Alaska to promote conservation and the passage of ANILCA. It was all HIGHLY charged politics in which the feds were dabbling, playing, frivolizing with OUR land. The outgrowth of both the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act and the Alaska National Interest Land Conservation Act are INCREDIBLY far reaching with regards to living and working in Alaska today. In that respect, the first two chapters of the book are now dated and rather nostalgic, kind of a time-capsule of what was going on while these landmark Congressional laws were being sussed out. The chapter \"Coming Into The Country\" (nearly half of the book) on the Yukon River\/Charley River area of Interior Alaska was by far the best part of the book, focusing on the communities of Central, Circle, and Eagle and the idealistic, sometimes hard-nosed characters that live there. Although McPhee, in what I've read, was an impressionable young man leaning to the side of environmental conservation at the expense of economic development, I think his writing in this book shows both a reverence for Alaska's brand of wilderness (in a word, awesome) as well as a sympathetic, humane perspective on the toll that Congressional protectionism, environmental regulation, and romantic idealism has on the lives of real families living in \"the country\". (The best writing is the transcription of journal entries made by a young man, Rich Corazza, living alone in a cabin somewhere around Eagle. This section is one third into the last section \"Coming Into The Country\" and made me grin and laugh out loud. A true seeker with a good dose of humor and longing.)"

        "text":"“If anyone could figure out how to steal Italy, Alaska would be the place to hid it.\" What a vivid way to describe Alaska's immensity. 'There has been a host of excellent books on Alaska. My favorite until recently was Joe McGinnis's Going to Extremes but John McPhee's Coming Into the Country is wonderful, too. McPhee's book is divided into three parts: first an exploration of wilderness described during the course of a canoe\/kayak trip down the Salmon River. Much in the manner of the river, his descriptions meander into all sorts of eddies and whirlpools. His description of bush pilots is priceless. On one occasion he is flying (a regularly scheduled airline, mind you) in a single engine plane in horrible weather. The pilot is skimming the trees to find landmarks because he can't see anything. He has a map on his lap, but suddenly hands it to a passenger to help figure out where they are. \"I had been chewing gum so vigorously that the hinges of my jaws would ache for two days.\" Stumbling on a grizzly bear in a blueberry patch (fortunately upwind), he muses on the best way to survive a grizzly's charge - no consensus of opinion, but most survivors believe the best thing to do is stand absolutely still and shout as loudly as possible, for that is the least likely reaction the bear, which does not have good sight, would expect of game. Running away is useless for grizzlies are very fast. They are also quite coordinated. They enjoy schussing down snow-covered mountains at 96 feet\/second through trees and around boulders only to screech to a stop, stand up and walk away, just before going -over the edge of a cliff. The second part of the book discusses the Alaskan government's search for a new capital and the conflict that generated. Juneau really makes a lousy site because of its remoteness, not to mention its horrible landing approach to the airport. Alaska attracts very independent and anti-authoritarian types of people so it witnesses a battle between those suffering from the \"Sierra Club Syndrome\" or others fondly embracing the \"Dallas Scenario.\" Many of these folks are affectionately profiled in the third section. John Cook, for example, has consciously tried to eliminate the need for money and authority. He tries to live on $1,500 a year (this was written in the mid seventies); he has a series of trap line s and rarely uses a parka, even at -30'. The closest town is Eagle, about 30 miles away via dog sled, with a population of about 100. Almost all live by the ut restrictions on code, \"Never put restrictions on any individual.... Up here they ain't gettin' you for spittin' on the sidewalk.\" Ironically, most moved there for the space, yet land is less available (as of 1977) than in the lower '48 because when Alaska became a state deals were made with the native Americans and the federal government to set aside almost the entire state as either a reservation or park land. Whereas before statehood someone could build a cabin 80 miles from nowhere, now a government helicopter might fly over and throw them out. Homesteading no longer exists, but in Alaska that loss seems especially poignant in territory where you might have to fly somewhere to take a shower."

So this is the third time I've read it. I've read maybe ten books three times, so I really, really like this. First, because McPhee writes so beautifully. He could write about anything and I would read it. I've even read his geology books. Not because I like geology, (I don't), but because I just eat up his words. It is like eating chocolate, I usually stop when the supply runs out, not because I'm finished. Second, the people and the spirit that makes up Alaska. Everything is so unbelievably huge. I love the stories about people who cut tractors up into pieces, fly them to remote regions, weld them back together so they can build an airstrip for a bigger plane. Third, the Alaska he writes about was disappearing when he wrote it, and has been replaced with at least two generations of Alaska since then. I will be visiting Alaska this summer and I am looking forward to seeing what's new and what remains of the old. Will it be strip malls? I'll let you know."

        "text":"This book is a somewhat lengthy discussion of three different aspects of Alaskan existence.  Although I have traveled to Alaska, I must admit that I am not very knowledgeable about its ways, although I have a few friends who have lived there and could probably have more to say about the sorts of deep divisions that Alaskan society has.  I must say, though, that in general much of the sort of division shown here is something that I can relate to as someone with a generally strong knowledge of the divisiveness of life in rural America and the wellspring of ambivalence there is about government and identity in many parts of the United States outside of the big cities.  Alaska does seem, at least in this book, to be a very small world, and small worlds have a great degree of similarity in that they bring out the pettiness and fractiousness of people to a greater extent than is evident when one looks only at human beings en masse.  If this book was definitely not my favorite by the author, it certainly provided, as always, an entertaining look at people the author happens to be spending a lot of time with. This nearly 450 page book is divided into three parts that explore different aspects of the Alaskan experience.  In the first book, \"The Encircled River,\" the author goes on an adventurous kayak adventure in one of Alaska's many Salmon Rivers, surrounded by the Brooks Range in northern Alaska and dealing with people as varied as forest Eskimos and government employees who want to protect large swaths of Alaskan wilderness as well as the possibility of harm from Alaska's massive grizzlies.  The second book, \"What They Were Hunting For,\" is a rather grim and self-absorbed look at Alaskans hunting for a location for a new state capital, arguing about the dominance of Anchorage, and demonstrating a distinct lack of interest in the rest of the world outside of their large but remote state, which at times almost seems like foreign territory for all it knows or cares of the lower 48.  Finally, the third book, \"Coming Into The Country,\" examines the divisions and rivalries among a group of people who have mostly left behind their life in the lower 48 and come to live in Alaska seeking homesteads, quarreling with the government while sometimes seeking public aid, and worried about politics and religion and questions of identity. Indeed, as a whole this particular book demonstrates the ferocity of identity questions when one looks at Alaska.  A wide variety of people seek very different things in coming to Alaska, including space from others even while remaining dependent on logistical chains going to larger cities, political power in a small world where it does not take much to be a big fish (and this even before Sarah Palin), and a desire to create a somewhat anarchical society with little money that is funded by government largess due to the oil wealth there, as well as an unspoiled wilderness free of anyone but themselves to sort out boundaries and questions of who deserves the landfalls to be received from the exploitation of the Alaskan wilderness and its resources.  I must admit that I do not find the Alaskans to be all that different from the people I grew up around, and I was pleased to find so many interested in books despite the difficulties of collecting books in such remote territory.  If Alaska is a bit cold and remote for my tastes, the tensions of Alaskan society are only slightly more exaggerated than those of most rural areas in the American west or south, for similar reasons of colonialism."

        "text":"McPhee's Coming Into the Country is rightly considered a classic with its detailed description on life in mid-1970s Alaska. Much of the writing is stunning, packed full of river trips and anecdotes about characters the author encountered during his many months in the country. He captures well the contradictions embodied in many Alaskans: a thirst for solitude alternating with a an affinity for social gatherings, an abhorrence of government even as they live and trap on public land, and the sparse population combined with a sense that there are few places left to go, live, and be free. McPhee's writing style full of rapid fire quotes summing up various points of view is effective in conveying these contradictions. He also captures an important transitional time in the state's history when the Trans-Alaskan oil pipeline and the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act were new realities. Read nearly 40 years after it was published, I believe the book reflects an important historical slice of Alaskan culture. Despite the overall high quality of writing, I found that some parts dragged (I found myself skimming dozens of pages related to a possible shift of Alaska's capital city from Juneau to parts unknown). If 4.5 stars were possible, that is what it would receive from me."

This book, about Alaska, is perhaps my favorite, or at least the one I'd recommend to someone who has never read McPhee before. These days, when everyone seems to have a severely truncated attention span, perhaps McPhee can seem a touch long-winded, but I completely disagree -- I don't think he wastes a sentence. He does write in a pre-internet way, and that, in my opinion, is nothing but good. Read him on paper, not an e-reader, if possible. Even better, take this book in your backpack and head up to Alaska. Perhaps take the public ferry there, out of Bellingham, Washington. It's extremely reasonable. Bring a sleeping bag and sleep on the sundeck, saving your money. You see the same sights as the most expensive cruise ships in the world, and you'll meet some amazing people. Read \"Coming into the Country\" at night. See the northern lights. Feel goosebumps all over. Change your life forever. That's what I did, and I haven't regretted it for a moment."

McPhee has some of the most wonderful prose I have ever read, and he tackles with it the three frontiers, all wild to different degrees: the political, the conservational, and the individual. The individual frontier being the most fascinating of all as he paints a living picture of the type of men that \"don't fit in\"."

The middle part is sly political commentary, but the last and longest part is what McPhee is always doing: introducing you to people and arranging that you see the world from their eyes, even when they can't do that for each other. The scale and the number of inhabitants of Eagle, AK, and environs is suitably Alaskan, and so alien to what I like, believe, care for, or share that it is astounding how long I spent in that place and still enjoyed myself.

Not this city boy. John McPhee was a Princeton-educated easterner from New Jersey with an interest in preservation and environmental concerns, but also an extraordinary ability to capture peoples with his depiction of their most mundane moments: foraging for food, constructing shelter in the subarctic wild, and even subsisting on public assistance in the extreme northwest fringes of the country. Yet he brings to life an assortment of highly developed real-life characters just living their usual lives under very unusual circumstances. The book is largely sectioned off into accounts of the author's personal travails through the bush north of Fairbanks but south of the North Slope: bears, ptarmigans, graylings, Eskimos, and ice cold glacial rivers. Then the story moves south to the story of site selection for the potential move of the capital from Juneau to Anchorage. Political intrigue, tensions between locals and the state and federal government. Bears. The Anchorage media sought to pressure a move closer to the center of population in the state, while Juneau persisted despite its remote location to the extreme southeast of the state. Finally, the author moves the story to the tiny towns north and east of Fairbanks such as Circle, Eagle, and Tok, where only the hardiest of diehards will brave the extreme winters, and bears, along the Yukon River at minus sixty and seventy below zero. I was amazed and impressed with the honesty and utterly guileless approach the author took to writing of river and bush people who are self-described isolationists. McPhee genuinely loves his subjects and relates their love for the land, despite their eccentricities, gruffness, and the endless cycle of death that pervades the wild. \"You look at this country, it hits you in the face. . . . That life and death are not a duality. They're just simply here--life, death--in the all-pervading mesh that holds things together.\" It's a rare thing to find a pick that captivates each time I pick it up, which reads so fluidly and seamlessly that it's akin to catching up with a longtime acquaintance. I read this book in preparation for an upcoming trip to Alaska, and what I found was a world of wonder unlocked by the narrative of a keen observer who loved those he observed. I am looking forward to my trip."

McPhee divided his exploration of Alaska into three sections--the first, stage-setting section on the northern tree line; the second, uses the search for an ideal site for a new state capital to explore urban Alaska; and the final section, on \"the bush,\" really focuses on the motives and lifestyles of in-migrants to the state. I breezed through the first two parts; the relocation of the state capital (which never happened) in particular was literally a bird's eye view of Alaskan cities and their inhabitants. The third part, however, desperately needed editing: descriptions of grizzly dangers, gold-sluicing methods, and conflicts among resource-hungry and cabin-fevered Yukon inhabitants became monotonous and overly repetitive. McPhee clearly became enamored of the rugged individualists who chose to leave the Lower Forty-eight behind to build lives based on subsistence and skills-building. While his book does not gloss over their less admirable qualities--a tendency toward paranoia, chaos, alchoholism, and particularly misogyny--he comes down firmly for their willingness to pit themselves against nature. Surveying the environmental effects of one gold-mining team's efforts, he writes, \"This pretty little stream is being disassembled in the name of gold.... Am I disgusted? Manifestly not.... This mine is a cork on the sea. Meanwhile (and, possibly more seriously), the relationship between this father and son is as attractive as anything I have seen in Alaska--both of them self-reliant beyond the usual reach of the term, the characteristic formed by this country.\" (410) This celebration of masculine triumph over nature is nothing new, and is disappointing from a writer who can be such a subtle thinker."
