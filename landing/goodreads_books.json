Harry Potter is waiting nervously in his bedroom at the Dursleys' house in Privet Drive for a visit from Professor Dumbledore himself. One of the last times he saw the Headmaster, he was in a fierce one-to-one duel with Lord Voldemort, and Harry can't quite believe that Professor Dumbledore will actually appear at the Dursleys' of all places. Why is the Professor coming to visit him now? What is it that cannot wait until Harry returns to Hogwarts in a few weeks' time? Harry's sixth year at Hogwarts has already got off to an unusual start, as the worlds of Muggle and magic start to intertwine...",

        "text":"(A) 86% | Extraordinary Notes: A relationshippy respite, it’s Sturm und Drang defogging: all lovesick woe, observing foes, and problematic snogging. *Check out progress updates for detailed commentary: Progress updates: 06\/24\/2020 - 3% (1) The Muggle Prime Minister would have been John Major. - No wonder he lost the 1997 election in a landslide. - Likely fictional, though, as Major wasn't elected to power, and his predecessor wasn't male. (2) Fudge: \"Is a man alive if he can't be killed? I don't really understand it, and Dumbledore won't explain properly.\" - Well, horcruxes are forbidden knowledge. 06\/25\/2020 - 6% (1) \"A threadbare sofa, an old armchair, and a rickety table stood grouped together in a pool of dim light cast by a candle-filled lamp.\" - How vampire-chic. - Snape's house could use a woman's touch. (2) \"In her fury [Bellatrix] looked slightly mad.\" - I guess she's always in her \"fury\" then. (3) I never hear of wizard divorces... perhaps they make unbreakable vows? 06\/26\/2020 - 9% (1) \"Rufus Scrimgeour ... has succeeded Cornelius Fudge as Minister of Magic. The appointment has largely been greeted with enthusiasm.\" - Appointment? By who? There doesn't appear to be any wizarding monarch or anything. (2) J.K. Rowling does love giving animal descriptions to antagonists: Scrimgeour is \"lionlike,\" Petunia has a \"horsey face,\" Vernon has \"piggy eyes,\" etc. 06\/27\/2020 - 13% (1) We're introduced to the idea of inferi, which are essentially zombies. The lack of a full-blown zombie chase is one of the series' big missed opportunities. (2) \"The wandlight sparkled on [Slughorn's] shiny pate, his prominent eyes, his enormous, silver, walruslike mustache ...\" - Again with the animal descriptors. (3) Gwenog Jones must be the Welshest name ever. 06\/28\/2020 - 17% Harry and Ginny be like, \"I shouldn't have been so happy about that hug.\" (1) Two weeks since last book and Hermione's already at the Burrow when Harry arrives? Poor Hermione's parents. (2) \"Hermione flashed a warning look at Ron, and Ron changed tack at top speed.\" - Already giving each other married couple signals. (3) Hermione: \"I know I failed everything!\" 06\/29\/2020 - 20% (1) Fred to Ginny: \"Moving through boyfriends a bit fast, aren't you?\" - Well, one per year's not so fast. Though, compared to the other Weasleys, I suppose. (2) '\"Our Decoy Detonators are just walking off the shelves, look,\" said Fred, pointing at a number of weird-looking black hooter-type objects.' - I presume \"hooter\" means something different in British English. 06\/30\/2020 - 23% (1) '\"She has let 'erself go, zat Tonks,\" Fleur mused.' - Sounds like Fleur's finally cottoned onto Molly and Ginny's cunning plan to get Bill to dump her for Tonks. (2) In the books, Luna's Spectrespecs are a kind of snake oil novelty. In the film they actually work! Film Luna is treated as more of an eccentric than the books, where she's sort of a lovable gullible. 07\/01\/2020 - 26% Ginny be like: \"Get a room you two.\" (1) It's a mark of Ron and Hermione's closeness that she's comfortable enough to hit him repeatedly with a book, and he's comfortable enough to let her. (2) Nearly Headless Nick: \"I would rather die than betray [Harry's] trust.\" Ron: \"That's not saying much, seeing as you're already dead.\" - Ron again with the common sense. 07\/02\/2020 - 29% Finally! Book-accurate bushy hair! (1) Snape: \"We are practicing nonverbal spells, Potter.\" Harry: \"Yes.\" Snape: \"Yes, sir.\" Harry: \"There's no need to call me 'sir,' Professor.\" - New levels of reckless sass. (2) Harry smells something flowery in the love potion. Just 10 pages later, Harry smells something flowery and turns to see Ginny. - Not exactly subtle. 07\/03\/2020 - 33% (1) The House of Gaunt has a very Craster's Keep vibe to it. (2) Merope seems right out of a Jane Austen novel. (3) Dumbledore: \"The Gaunts [were] noted for a vein of instability and violence that flourished through the generations due to their habit of marrying their own cousins.\" - Not so different than European royals, then... and a fair bit better than Egyptians. 07\/04\/2020 - 36% (1) Ron gets attention from Lavender, Hermione gives him the cold shoulder. Hermione congratulates Ron, Lavender walks off grumpy. Meanwhile, Ron's totally oblivious. (2) Harry: \"But wasn't that dishonest, Hermione? I mean, you're a prefect, aren't you?\" - Hermione gets a taste of her own medicine here, seeing as she says this to Ron all the time, albeit less polite. 07\/05\/2020 - 39% Callback\/Mirroring: You've got something on your face. (1) Harry: \"The Prince had proved a much more effective teacher than Snape so far.\" - Oh the irony. (2) Hermione: \"Ron, what are you staring at?\" Ron: \"Nothing.\" Hermione: \"I expect 'nothing's' in the back getting more firewhisky.\" - Ron crushing on Madam Rosmerta and Hermione being jealous never gets old. 07\/06\/2020 - 42% (1) Wonder if Caractacus Burke was named after the Briton chieftain or the dad from Chitty-Chitty-Bang-Bang? (2) Orphanage matron: \"He was to be named Tom, for his father, and Marvolo, for her father — yes, I know, funny name, isn't it? We wondered whether she came from a circus.\" - Hmm... The Great Marvolo! (3) Young Voldemort owning a harmonica is just plain funny. 07\/07\/2020 - 44% (1) Harry: \"What if Ron and Hermione started going out together, then split up? Could their friendship survive it?\" - Depends how much they enjoy bickering... it's kind of their thing. (2) \"What if they didn't split up? What if ... it became excruciatingly embarrassing to be in their presence, so that he was shut out for good?\" - Classic third-wheel talk right there. 07\/08\/2020 - 46% (1) Harry: \"Ginny, don't call Ron a prat, you're not the Captain of this team.\" Ginny: \"Well, you seemed too busy to call him a prat.\" - Can't fault the logic. (2) Ginny teases Ron for \"never snogg[ing] anyone in his life.\" She also tells Ron \"Hermione snogged Viktor Krum.\" Enraged and shamed, Ron snogs stalkerish Lavender Brown. Ergo, Ginny's to blame for that mess. 07\/09\/2020 - 48% Ron makes Hermione cry on stairs a lot. (1) Ron: \"She can't complain ... She snogged Krum. So she's found out someone wants to snog me too ... I haven't done anything wrong.\" - Ron's not wrong, but misses the point. (2) Hermione: \"He's at perfect liberty to kiss whomever he likes ... I really couldn't care less.\" - She sure talks about it a lot for not caring. 07\/10\/2020 - 49% (1) '\"Are you going out with [Cormac], then?\" asked Parvati, wide-eyed. \"Oh — yes — didn't you know?\" said Hermione, with a most un-Hermione-ish giggle.' - I doubt there's even a Hermione-ish giggle. Mostly she blushes. (2) Harry: \"Serves you right for coming with [Cormac].\" Hermione: \"I thought he'd annoy Ron most.\" - I expect no less from a jealousy-fueled romance. 07\/11\/2020 - 51% (1) \"Harry ... was still trying not to think about Ginny any more than he could help, despite the fact that she kept cropping up in his dreams in ways that made him devoutly thankful that Ron could not perform Legilimency.\" - Hopefully those dreams aren't Voldemort's doing. (2) \"Harry was left to ponder in silence the depths to which girls would sink to get revenge.\" 07\/12\/2020 - 53% Harry and Ginny be like: Not cool bro! (1) Kreacher gifts Harry a box of maggots. Not useful, but it's the thought that counts. (2) '\"Harry, you've got a maggot in your hair,' said Ginny cheerfully, leaning across the table to pick it out; Harry felt goose bumps erupt up his neck that had nothing to do with the maggot.' - Most romantic maggot scene in fiction? 07\/13\/2020 - 56% (1) \"Abstinence\" is the new common room password. Sneaky, having students recite it repeatedly. (2) Harry: \"Hermione, can't you [make up with Ron]?\" Hermione: \"No, I can't... So don't even ask.\" - Can't or won't? (3) \"The contents proved difficult to empty into the Pensieve, as though they had congealed slightly; did memories go bad?\" - Eh, only the regrettable ones. 07\/14\/2020 - 58% (1) Hermione: \"Oh, well, if Won-Won thinks that, you'd better do it ... After all, when has Won-Won's judgment ever been faulty?\" - It's contagious! Now Hermione's saying \"Won-Won.\" Sarcasm, yes, but \"Won-Won\" regardless. (2) \"Friends they might be, but if Ron started calling Lavender 'Lav-Lav,' [Harry] would have to put his foot down.\" - The buck stops at \"Lav-Lav\"! 07\/15\/2020 - 60% Poor Lavender :( (1) Hermione: \"Golpalott's Third Law states that the antidote for a blended poison will be equal to more than the sum of the antidotes for each of the separate components.\" - That makes no sense! How can something be equal to more than a sum? It would just be greater than it! (2) The gif never happens in the book, but it's my favorite scene :) 07\/16\/2020 - 62% (1) \"[Harry] was now being dogged wherever he went by Cormac McLaggen and Lavender Brown. He could not decide which of them was more annoying.\" - I vote Lavender. (2) \"Harry's imagination zoomed into overdrive ... Ginny, weeping over his lifeless form, confessed her feelings of deep attraction to him while Ron gave them his blessing.\" - Pretty passive ambition there. 07\/17\/2020 - 64% (1) Lavender: \"Is Hermione Granger still visiting [Ron]?\" Harry: \"Yeah, I think so. Well, they're friends, aren't they?\" Lavender: \"Friends, don't make me laugh ... She didn't talk to him for weeks after he started going out with me! But I suppose she wants to make up with him now he's all interesting.\" - Now we know what Lavender looks for in a partner. Interesting. 07\/18\/2020 - 68% (1) Lavender to Ron: \"Why didn't you tell me you were getting out today? And why was she with you?\" - I suppose a condition of being Lavender's boyfriend is having to cut loose all your female friends. (2) Voldemort: \"You are omniscient as ever, Dumbledore.\" Dumbledore: \"Oh no, merely friendly with the local barmen.\" - That's some stealthy foreshadowing there. 07\/19\/2020 - 71% (1) Ron: \"I love you, Hermione.\" Hermione: \"Don't let Lavender hear you saying that.\" Ron: \"I won't ... Or maybe I will ... then she'll ditch me.\" - Essentially, that's what happened in the film. (2) The Imperius Curse = Temporary insanity defense. (3) Harry supposes Tonks was in love with Sirius, which no one thinks is weird. Wizard views on incest are oddly casual. 07\/20\/2020 - 73% (1) Ron: \"Quick, hide me!\" Hermione: \"It isn't Lavender!\" - If it were Lavender, I think hiding behind Hermione would make things much worse. (2) Harry hesitates to use his vial of Felix Felicis, having saved it to break up Ginny and Dean. Luckily, that happened as a side effect of his Slughorn mission. So, bonus points. - Incidentally, Harry's low-key a homewrecker. 07\/21\/2020 - 75% (1) '\"What were you doing up there with her?\" shrieked Lavender Brown, staring right through Harry at Ron and Hermione emerging together from the boys' dormitories.' - Lavender's suspicions confirmed! - Lucky all around... except Lavender. (2) Slughorn: \"Had a house-elf taste every bottle after what happened to your poor friend Rupert.\" - I see what she did there :) 07\/22\/2020 - 78% (1) '\"You have [uncommon skill and power],\" said Dumbledore firmly. \"You have a power that Voldemort has never had. You can —\" \"I know!\" said Harry impatiently. \"I can love!\" It was only with difficulty that he stopped himself adding, \"Big deal!\".' - I had the same reaction as Harry to the ending of \"The Fifth Element.\" \"Really? Love is the greatest power there is?\" 07\/23\/2020 - 82% (1) Flitwick: \"A little less talk, a little more action.\" - Wasn't that an Elvis song? No, wait, that was \"A Little Less Conversation.\" (2) Harry's mind: \"She's Ron's sister. But she's ditched Dean! She's still Ron's sister. I'm his best mate! That'll make it worse. If I talked to him first — He'd hit you. What if I don't care? He's your best mate!\" - Ron, Ron, Ron. 07\/24\/2020 - 85% (1) Ginny: \"All Romilda Vane does is ask me if it's true you've got a hippogriff tattooed across your chest ... I told her it's a Hungarian Horntail ... Much more macho.\" - Harry's already kinda got a lightning bolt tattoo, and on his face too! I'd guess that's be even more macho. (2) \"Rage and resentment fought shock and excitement.\" - Fight it! Angst was so Book 5. 07\/25\/2020 - 86% (1) Perhaps Harry's grown too used to magic. He's fine charging headlong into danger, but a short swim in cold water totally freaks him out. Who is he? Film-Ron? (2) \"Harry had long since learned that bangs and smoke were more often the marks of ineptitude than expertise.\" - I wonder if he's referring to Seamus, who's gimmick is he often accidentally blows things up? 07\/26\/2020 - 87% (1) How is Harry shocked that blood magic is a thing? Voldemort was revived by his blood! (2) Dumbldore: \"You are underage and unqualified. Voldemort would never have expected a sixteen-year-old to reach this place: I think it unlikely that your powers will register compared to mine.\" - So... Harry should be glad the alarm can't detect his negligible amount of magic. 07\/27\/2020 - 88% (1) Harry needs blood to open the archway. Luckily, he was already cut whilst fighting Inferi. Even zombies have a silver lining. (2) '\"It's going to be all right, sir,\" Harry said over and over again ... \"Don't worry...\" \"I am not worried, Harry,\" said Dumbledore, his voice a little stronger despite the freezing water. \"I am with you.\"' - Hits me right in the feels. *character limit Click here for the rest [\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>"

They may have been put under the Imperius Curse.\" Time for interesting little subplots is over. We've arrived finally, where everything is closely tied to the core of the story and progressing fast. It's always delightful to see, everything that was great about the series still remains the same, if not better. However, disappointments, sorrow and hardships are what the reader is going to encounter for the most part. As I finished reading Half-Blood Prince, more than ever before, I feel being trapped in a hopeless situation filled with nothing but forebodings. \"Destination...determination...deliberation...\" One would imagine, we're beyond being accommodated with new characters, but the author will quickly convince you otherwise, and introduction of new and interesting characters continues. It's great to see how Rowling keeps outperforming herself with each new book . Harry's ill-tempered nature and suspicions does not end with the last book as I hoped it would, but the results are quite the opposite this time around. Honestly, I did not anticipate the way how things turned out right till the last three chapters. \"To friendship! To generosity! To ten Galleons a hair! We've been somewhat used to happy ending in the first four books (relatively) with 5th being a bit disappointing but this one, it was the most depressing ending for me yet. It probably comes down to reinforcing the suspense toward the final book but, it's a difficult place to be in - especially if you had to wait for a year.. \"Eet 'as been too long!\""

I was expecting this installment to be mainly filler to get us to the Deathly Hallows, but so much happened here that I must have forgotten from the movie. The Half-Blood prince was considerably darker than the previous 5 books, and I just adore how this series has progressed and grown just like most of its readers have. Obviously I knew what the big reveal was prior to finishing the book due to my viewing the films before, but it didn't take away from the experience the novel had to offer. I have this nervous lump in my throat knowing that the next book is the final one, but am simultaneously excited to finally read what the films surely have left out surrounding the conclusion of the series."

Severus, who sacrificed his own soul. Severus, who loved another more than life itself. Severus, the half-blood prince- the truth about his character was, and will likely always be, one of the most surprising twists I’ve ever read in fiction. The set up is all in this book."

        "text":"I was first introduced to Harry Potter in a Children’s Lit class in college. I had resisted this popular phenomenon until I was forced to pick it up for a grade, and Book 1 was short enough that I could read it in the course of 2 hours. I have to admit I wasn’t impressed to any extent, nor did I dislike the experience, but I was critical on grounds of its being derivative, even if reading the first led to reading the second. After all, if I was bored and looking for something light, I could do worse than a fantasy about a child wizard who fights evil with his friends. But it was really the third book, with its increasing darkness, that took me in and made me a fan. With a movie coming out for Order of Phoenix and Deathly Hallows on the horizon, I decided I would reread Half-Blood Prince. I figured it would take four sittings, of course, with its 600 pages, but time does fly when reading this one, and I’ve come to the conclusion that this is my favorite so far. What I wouldn’t have been willing to admit in college that I’m perfectly comfortable saying now is that J.K. Rowling is a fantastic storyteller; she writes with great clarity, wit, and humor; and she’s created a cast of loveable characters with whom most people, due to the common experience of growing up, can relate closely. That said, the reason for my preference for the 6th book is that it’s the most emotionally rich in the series. Here we get the backstory of Voldemort (*spoiler alert*) through a series of flashbacks (coming in HP by way of magically extracted memories), and in this way, we come to understand the villain’s similarities and differences with our hero. After all, the villain has to have reasons for committing heinous acts, and until now, we don’t know what these are. Voldemort is from a once-powerful wizard family reduced to poverty that lives in a dilapidated hovel on the edge of a small town, wary of outsiders, and their main point of pride is their pure blood, the lineage having cross-bred for generations so as not to pollute the line. Voldemort’s mother lives with her father and brother and yearns for the love of a nonmagical man (“muggle” in this world) and when her father and brother are arrested, she uses the opportunity to bewitch her beloved and run off. She ends up pregnant, the man deserts her, and she dies while giving birth to her half-wizard, half-muggle son, thus making him an orphan (like Harry). (Faulkner anyone?) But whereas Harry comes to Hogwarts and befriends Ron and Hermione creating unity and strength through positive emotions, Voldemort, when growing in the orphanage shuns other children, torturing them at times (without the awareness of adults) and stealing their possessions. What fuels him is his hatred of his beginnings, his mother’s weakness at having died like a common person despite being a witch, and the “muggle” blood inherited from his father. Over the course of his time at Hogwarts, Voldemort, charming as only evil can be, learns to win over people as a means to an end and disguise his insidious purposes, but he never befriends anyone. He moves, through his hatred, further away from many of the emotions that drive Harry, namely the desire to protect the people he loves and avenge his parents’ death. With Dumbledore’s help in exploring Voldemort’s past, Harry begins to understand that he’s come to be where he is through the choices he’s made, that his greatest strengths are an alliance with his friends, and that this might hold the key to destroying his enemy, a fact that’s made all the more poignant when Dumbledore, in an all-out assault on Hogwarts by Voldemort’s Death Eaters, is killed at the end. The stakes are higher than before, the action and pace increase as the conclusion draws near, and things are looking darker than ever, which is the setup that any fan wants when the end is looming and it leaves us with the question: How will our hero prevail?"

        "text":"Reminder that all of my Harry Potter reviews contain unmarked spoilers, and lots of ’em. If you’re one of the two people on Goodreads who hasn’t read this series, this review is not for you. So, my dear underside-of-a-rock-residing friends: https:\/\/emmareadstoomuch.wordpress.co... This review will be interesting, because this book was far (far, far) from perfect, and yet I am utterly determined to give it 5 stars. (Which I have only given to the first book in this series.) God, how do you talk about this book? It’s really amazing. It is really hard for me to feel anything while reading a book or generally living my life . For example, I felt nothing when Sirius died. Nothing throughout most of this series, actually. And nothing in this book, because nothing happened and everyone survived and everything is sunshiney and joyful! Ugh. I tried. The last hundred-ish pages of this book really tore me apart. Okay, even that’s not true. I’ll just come out and say it: I’m really f*cking sad that Dumbledore died. I love him so much. He’s high up in my top 5 characters. (Do I even have a top 5?) I’m devastated, which makes me even more upset, because I have a life to live today and can’t just lay around and wallow in fictional pain. I’m going to move on in the hopes that I just. Forget. Because I don’t like this at ALL. Here, we see Harry Potter - who, I think few will argue, has been a fairly mediocre character up to this point - become AMAZING. He’s motivated solely by his need to work against injustice and evil. He realizes his parents’ legacy within himself. He denounces the sucking up of others. He works hard in school! He is a good friend even when his two BFFS are being childish to one another plus refusing to believe him. In short, he’s really, really, five-star-level great here. Gorgeous character development in 650 pages. I didn’t think I liked Ginny much, because I didn’t remember this book well...like, at all. But she is so great! So funny. I wish there was more of her in this book. Also, I’ll fight anyone who says Dumbledore is ~the real villain~ of this series. He’s really not. (Cough, Snape is, cough.) AND YOU'RE NOT EDGY, PEOPLE WHO HATE DUMBLEDORE BUT LOVE SNAPE. YOU'RE JUST DUMB. I fell deeply in love with the guy. (Dumbledore, not Snape. BLEH.) AND I F*CKING MISS HIM. Goddamn it. Trying to forget didn’t last very long. Anyway. I missed Hermione and Neville. Hermione was absolutely not well-represented here at all. Maybe it’s a good thing she’s not a Ravenclaw (#RavenclawPride) because she works fully against logic throughout this book. And when she’s not she just, like, refuses to believe Harry. Ron is soooooooooo annoying! Is he anyone’s favorite character? He’s like, Fred or George if one of them was totally childish and attention-starved and mean. In fact, Ronald is a pretty impressive character for the number of gross character traits he embodies despite being supposed to be a good character. Mean, immature, rude, jealous, definition of an inferiority complex. Bleh. Harry and Ginny I’m totally for, BUT THE OTHER RELATIONSHIPS IN THIS BOOK ARE SO BORING. Can we do Hermione and Fred instead? Ron and Luna would be cute. Or, God forbid, some LGBT representation? WE KNOW YOU’RE A SUPPORTER, JOANNE. Don’t even get me started on Lupin and Tonks. Speaking of supposedly-good characters’ downfalls: I’m no longer a Hagrid fan. It started with the last book and came fully around here. Like, at a certain point, the man needs a character trait. Liking weird animals, making bad food, and being humongous don’t count. Harry and Hermione’s constant stubbornness is annoying. Plus makes the plot repetitive once in a while. Also, Tonks. You know what, I guess I AM going to get started on Lupin and Tonks! She was a hilarious badass in the last book, totally depressed and weak in this one. I know I sound like a total emotionless asshole here, but that’s who I am, and she’s annoying in this book. AND IT’S TOTALLY FINE BECAUSE SHE’S JUST BEING A SPINELESS IDIOT OVER SOME DUMB SHABBY MAN. Kill me, please. Then I can see my beloved Dumbledore again. Too much Snape. (Cannot WAIT to write the rant on him.) Too much Draco. (Why do people romanticize that little weirdo so much? I guess I get the temptation, but he’s a bully at best and a spineless traitor at worst.) I hate Kreacher and I hate Dobby...I hated Winky, too...I might hate house elves. If that makes me racist against a species of fictional character, SO BE IT, I GUESS. I miss Fred and George, and the fun people from the Order (if they existed), and Hermione and Neville aren’t here nearly enough. The price of Harry’s amazing and concise character development is WAY too many bad characters, not nearly enough of the good ones. EXCEPT DUMBLEDORE. UGHHHH. I’M SO SAD. (I think my inability to cry is making this worse. Maybe if I just creepily sobbed in front of my roommate for a few minutes I’d feel better. Damn you, my lack of emotions! Just kidding love you.) But I want to give this book five stars more than anything. It was so compulsively readable, more than any other book since the first for me. And it’s the last book where our pals are attending Hogwarts. That makes me so sad. It’s such a gorgeous setting and I’m going to miss it so much. WHY IS THIS BOOK SO SAD?! If Deathly Hallows is any sadder I’ll be seriously impressed. And also seriously screwed. And, okay, even though I was a harsh critic of these books...I’m really going to miss this series. I’ve been rereading it on and off (obviously) for three months, and it’s been a fun ride. This is one of the greatest settings of all time. And since I’m rereading it after 10 years, it’s like saying goodbye twice. AND I HATE ENDINGS. Bottom line: Okay, THIS is my favorite Harry Potter book. (Anyone else’s?) Unreal character development + tragic and lovely adieu to a gorgeous setting + ability to make me feel real, deep emotion + compulsively readable? An absolute dream. ----------ORIGINAL REVIEW--------------- Ron and Hermione's will-they-won't-they is a total snoozefest. I propose Fred & Hermione and Ron & Luna instead. Also seven more books!"

        "text":"For a long time this book had a special place in my freezer with my favorite ice creams and frozen food I was banned to cook (I eventually burn them when I defreeze them. I was born with non-culinary skills!) I repeated what Joey Tribbianni did because after finishing this book I cried so hard, I cursed nonstop, I screamed till my local cords declare their uselessness and I tried to throw the hardcopy out of the window but I changed my mind because an innocent kid may have found the book at the outside and started to read and cry nonstop! So instead of throwing away or burning the pages( which is so harsh punishment because this book is still a classic and it’s one of the best ones of the series)freezing the book and never forgiving the author for killing one of my favorite characters were the best choices I’ve had. As my new weekend quarantine habit: I started retro weekend tradition and reread my favorite series. Even though this book broke my heart more than a decade before, at least this time I prepared myself with lots of tissues and golden toilet papers( they’re so precious things and I hang them on the walls with hand sanitizers as if they’re historical artifacts.) and I bottled up my happy memories inside my head to protect my heart tear apart. This is sweet 16 adventures of Harry: the girl crushes, secret smiles, hormonal and characteristic changes, seeing the world from different aspect! If I didn’t get so sad with the unexpected ending, this might be second favorite HP book because JKR- wizard of the words reflected the emotional and psychical changing as they grow up more and realize the biggest danger out there to steal their best times of their lives. I never get bored to reread any HP books or anything JKR writes. (instead of shopping list. Lately they made me sleep!) So I had quite great time with my nostalgic journey to the past and realize I will find myself reading these books a decade later and I will still get the great taste of literature and have quality time. That’s the magic of skilled writing and gifted talent!"

        "text":"Second Reread Review: REVIEW TO COME SOON ••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••• 5 GLOWING MAGICAL STARS! 'Dumbledore says people find it far easier to forgive others for being wrong than being right,' said Hermione. 'I heard him telling your mum, Ron.' I'm really enjoying this series so far but this series gets darker and darker. the first three of this series were so funny and cute even though there were sad scenes on them and the fourth, fifth and sixth books contained so much pain and I even shed more tears for these book than I did for the the first three. I have lost a favorite character that always made me laugh and smile. this character is Sirus Black. I even still can't get over his death. but let's admit it that maybe there's a death of character that we will never get over. *takes deep breath* okay let's talk about this book ・。・゜★・。・。☆・゜・。・゜。・。・゜★・。・。☆・。・゜★・。・。 PHLEGM I have never liked Fleur Delacour very much since I first saw her on the book four and then I saw her again on the book four as Bill's girlfriend or Fiancee and I also laughed when Ginny called Fleur Phlegm. I also still don't how Bill fell in love with her but yeah, she is pretty but I thought Bill deserved someone better than her. I like Bill so much. he is so cool with his red long hair. maybe I didn't like Phlegm because I was jealous hahahaha okay it is not maybe, I was jealous. but look at this scene : ''E is always so thoughtful,' purred Fleur adoringly, stroking Bill's nose. Ginny mimed vomiting into her cereal behind Fleur. Harry choked over his cornflakes and Ron thumped him on the back. ugh ... how could I like her if she acted like that?!? that was really annoying and Ginny also found it disgusting. Hermione and Ginny didn't even like her. but she changed my mind on the the end of this book because when Bill was attacked by ... that werewolf guy who bit Remus when he was a kid. Bill is no longer as handsome as he used to be but Fleur still loves him. she doesn't care about how he looks and I even thought she would leave him after he was attacked but she didn't and that time I changed my mind about her. She is the right girl for Bill, even though I am a little bit jealous hahaha xD Ron and Hermione I ship these two so much and I really really like Ron. Ron and Hermione are always funny. they always bicker about something and I think the first time Ron fell in love with Hermione was on the book four because he was so angry when he knew Hermione went to the Yule Ball with Viktor Krum and in this book Ron hurt me so much. He thought that Hermione kissed Krum and he was so angry and jealous because of this and he kissed Lavender in the common room that was full of people and it also broke Hermione's heart. Harry looked into the corner she was indicating. There, in full view of the whole room, stood Ron wrapped so closely around Lavender Brown it was hard to tell whose hands were whose. And I was so angry in that moment 'Er - my - nee,' croaked Ron unexpectedly from between them. but all my anger was gone when he was poisoned and he said that while he was asleep. I think he was trying to say Hermione, so that meant he dreamt about her and I forgave him that exact time and he also didn't really like Lavender anymore since then. he even pretended to be asleep when Lavender came to visit him in the hospital wing. so that meant he didn't like her anymore and I don't think he actually liked Lavender before he was poisoned. I think he just kissed Lavender because he wanted to make Hermione jealous and feel hurt, which he successfully did. Harry And Ginny have you ever thought why Ginny had relationship with quite many guys? wait ... not many guys because she just dated two boys, Dean and Michael. But she always got a boyfriend as soon as she split up with her ex and my thoughs about this is probably right because Ginny said this to Harry on the end of the book 'I never really gave up on you,' she said. 'Not really. I always hoped ... Hermione told me to get on with life, maybe go out with some other people, relax a bit around you, because I never used to be able to talk if you were in the room, remember? And she thought you might take a bit more notice if I was a bit more - myself.' I think Ginny always dated a guy as soon as she split up with her ex because she always tried to forget Harry, so maybe if she had a boyfriend, she wouldn't love Harry anymore. But according to what she said she never really gave up on Harry so that means she has always loved him. I was a bit sad when Harry said they can't be together again because Harry was afraid if something would happen to Ginny if they kept seeing each other. he was afraid if Voldemort used Ginny to get him. but I didn't angry with him because this just proved how much Harry loves Ginny and I am sure they will be together again. I hope so ... Dumbledore's death I admit that Dumbledore is not one of my top favorite characters in this series but I always found him funny and a bit weird, in a good way, of course. But his death left me in shock because he was actually pleading to Snape but Snape killed him with The Avada Kedavra curse and I thought Snape was on the good side. What will happen now after Dumbledore died?! He is the only one Voldemort is afraid of. I have this feeling that I'll to lose my favorite characters again ... thank you so much for reading and liking my review. hope you all have a great weekend, guys!"

        "text":"4.5 Golden Stars 92% yeah, it was dark, but probably the most Hilarious book of HP; it IS a Comedy! I was rolling in laughter! Hilarious Ron, sassy Harry & Hermione's wittiness & the unique fun in the writing style, the impression, the descriptions, the comparisons. anyway, don't get mad at me, but this book is my least favourite in Harry Potter series. it was kind of disappointment for me. 3 years gap, reading the other fantastic books many times, guessing & after that shocking end in book 5, looking forward to this one, to be greater than others as we are close to end... in one sentence: I was not satisfied after reading it. (IK the book was the calm before the storm, but still.) & don't get me wrong; it was a disappointment Only compared to other HP books. Boring start. (2 chapters without anything related to Hogwarts or the golden trio) Harry was obsessed with what Malfoy was up to, the whole year & for the first time, I found Harry annoying. risking for no good reason, only his hunch. maybe this is the main reason I didn't like this book. (I hate 'Sectumsempra' chapter , always get mad at him.) always yelling: Don't! No! you idiot, Harry! because he is my favourite character... (though now after many times re-reading, at some points, I found those parts hilarious too, ) at the end, he was right though. also, lack of funny sarcastic retorts between Harry & Draco :( almost whole events were like side-jobs (except the... you-know-what) A.K.A the Slug club truth: I don't care about Slughorn either. those chapter he just talked & talked about celebrities once-were-his students... ughhhh. Adrenaline peak parts were not satisfying & not enough (amounts). the whole story was a bit ordinary & nothing happened in the whole school year, in particular. (like school wasn't at an immediate, solid grave danger (book 2, 3, 7 & maybe 5), the golden trio wasn't solving mysteries (1, 2, 4, 5, 7) or something as intriguing as these. they were just attending classes, boring parties, slug club & these normal stuff. though I like the classes & the Hogwarts routine, justt ass I enjoyed in book 5. whenever I missed Hogwarts this book, along with 5, is my go-to. just the Slug club ruined it a little. but in total, other parts (except Malfoy & Slug club); maybe not high peak of adrenaline (as I said), but interesting, & funny; we all wanted to know who the half-blood prince was, Quidditch was great as always & the parts with Dumbledore were fascinating. I liked the second half of the book more, like finally this book stepped into action! & that end was the \"Beginning of the End\"! But main reason: his obsession with Malfoy; 'OMG! Harry, just come off it!' , therefore Harry being annoying, therefore lack of Harry's sarcasm comebacks with Malfoy, lowered this book to my least favourite. However.... on the bright side, there are parts I love too: ❤ sassy Harry was the best! There's no need to call me \"sir\", professor. Bless you JKR! Bless you Harry Potter! one of the sassiest comments in the history of sass masters! my first reaction when I see this, was: whaaaa!?... then \"omg! Harry! did you just...!?\" & re-read the sentence to see if I got it right & then... putting the book down ( \"Hail Harry Potter!\" ) & burst out laughing! & that's that, ever since! although there was no sarcastic comebacks between Potter & Malfoy, but this book had many funny moments by other characters. \"Well, you can’t break an Unbreakable Vow...\" (Gee! Thanks Ron!) \"I’d worked that much out for myself, funnily enough!” & Harry was not just being sassy & sarcastic, but also being funny & clueless too, which was laughable. Ron's jokes with ghosts always made me choke with laughter! ❤ Friendships Harry & Ron's friendship (always one of my favourite brotps) funny, great, looking after each other. always love it, in all books. Roonil Wazlib! also Harry & Hermione's. (especially after Ron & Hermione's bickering), beautiful, caring, protective. again, I love it in all the books. I actually noticed after years of rereading, now Romione has lowered in its place for me & I ship these two more. they care so much for each other. (I'm thinking it's probably also a brotp. well, it's complicated to decide if I want to accept the canon (because I do love canon too) or my mind. the point is, I love the moments with these two together :) ❤ the writing style is just Unique & perfect & funny! ❤ my favourite chapters are \"the Cave\" & \"Horcruxes\"; awesome, exciting with unexpected amount of surprises. I actually loved them. I loved the main-stream parts with Dumbledore. I loved how Harry, at some points, admired Tom. & how he unfolded this story & also sympathized with other characters. ❤ I liked Dumbledore in this book. ❤ at least after that terrible mistake (mentioned above), the chapter ended beautifully; my favourite part, that magical romantic moment, how well described, what a glamorous scene. My first ship finally sinking! \"... After several long moments, or it might have been half an hour-or possibly several sunlit days- they broke apart. The creature in his chest roaring in triumph.\" (& I was really angry when the movie CHANGED this scene! actually I really loved the first 3 movies (they were so similar to the books) & 5 too (tho it was a bit different & they mostly deleted the humor parts), 4 was similar enough, just darker than my imagination. but movies 6 & 7 just had the same quotes (almost) & changed or deleted scenes a lot, therefore those completely disappointed me. :( ❤ & I was proud Harry became Team Captain ! Quidditch were funny, especially the first one ( You Clever Harry! XD ). except not the commentator, but Harry made a funny moment of that too ;) ❤ Don't forget how Gracefully this book was written. (& how delicately Rowling chose to show they were swearing without any direct swears. I love it. it doesn't make me apprehensive, on the contrary, it makes me laugh very hard & respect the pure talent.) Hail Queen! 10th read ; November 2019: I could've given 5 Stars because of Sassy Harry (I mean, Harry just being savagely Sassy this year! XD) & beautiful, magnificent choices of the words & compare to a few of my 5 stars this book definitely deserves 5; but I'm not satisfied with it (still things that annoy me) so I probably won't. Although there's a progress, the rating score has risen to 4.5 now. 13th read ; June 2022: never have read this book this quick! thanks to BR with my new Potterhead !

There were things I'd forgotten, e.g. how late Harry and Ginny got together. I'd also forgotten about most of the funeral. I'll say no more, spoilers oblige . What this book tells me is that sadly the more conservative of readers, grammarians etc will place so many books above Harry Potter #6, none of which is worth mentioning in the same breath as Potter lore. To me this series is special. Nobody else will undertake waiting for each book to come out and lay our hands on them. The Potter universe will belong to our descendants forever. But it was we who helped create this fervor and unmatched popularity."

It's the first time that the Muggle world and the magic one come bluntly face to face. J.K. Rowling chooses that the first chapter of this novel is the right time for this interaction, highlighting the dramatic situation and the necessary cooperation to stem the enemy of all: Lord Voldemort. The bedtime reading for my daughter became less lighthearted and more serious by now. Luckily, for some difficult questions Dumbledore bails me out every time: «It is the unknown we fear when we look upon death and darkness, nothing more» We're almost there, the end of the journey is close. Unfortunately, it will never be the same. Vote: 9 «Era quasi mezzanotte e il Primo Ministro stava seduto da solo nel suo ufficio, a leggere una lunga relazione che gli scivolava via dalla mente senza lasciare la minima traccia» A seguito dei numerosi attacchi dei mangiamorte, Il nuovo Ministro della Magia Rufus Scrimgeour, fresco di nomina, decide di incontrare il Primo Ministro britannico babbano... E' la prima volta che il mondo babbano e quello magico si trovano ad interloquire senza mezzi termini. J.K. Rowling decide che il primo capitolo è il momento giusto per questa interazione, a sottolineare la drammaticità della situazione e la necessaria collaborazione allo scopo di arginare il nemico di tutti: Voldemort. Oramai la lettura serale per mia figlia si è fatta decisamente meno spensierata e più impegnata.

Harry’s Quidditch Captain! Yaaas! 3. Weasleys’ Wizzard Wheezes (Say this ten times) 4. Malfoy’s head on Pansy Parkinson’s lap and Pansy stroking his head. *shudders* 5. Slughorn’s belly preceded him out of the door. Bahaha 6. Potions class has never been this cheerful. Thanks Grampy Sloghorn and Harry has never performed better. Thanks to cheating. Lol. 7. Ron, you bollocks! Stop being an idiot, WonWon! 8. Voldemort as a student seems to me even more sinister than the Dark Lord he already is. *shivers* 9. Like Harry, I am Dumbledore’s man through and through. Take that, Rufus! 10. I’d go back to school anytime if it meant having Professor Dumbledore as a teacher. 11. Aherm! Why do you keep looking for Ginny, now Harry? 12. There’s a reason a Dark Arts teacher stays only for a year. It’s all clear now. 13. Who would have thought that the once timid Ginny will blossom into a confident, beautiful, charming, funny and best of all, snarky girl? 14. Chapter 24 will particularly make you swoon! Gaaah! I ship Harry and Ginny! <3 15. RIP, Aragog. 16. For the first time, I solved the mystery! I have guessed early on in the story that the Half Blood Prince was Snape! Yaaas! 17. I knew there was a reason Harry spent so much time with Professor Dumbledore. I can’t… *sobs* Some of the things\/characters missing in the movie: 1. Kreacher and Dobby 2. Bill and Fleur 3. Dumbledore’s Army and the Order of the Phoenix putting up a fight against the Dark Eaters. 4. . Harry breaking up with Ginny which reminds me of Peter Parker and Mj. Finally, as a simple tribute to the wisest, kindest, most revered and one of the most powerful wizards (whose death out of the many deaths hurts me the most that I cried so much, I may have cried harder than Hagrid), the following is a collection of a few of his great thoughts and words that’ll be forever etched in our hearts. *sniffs* “In fact, being-forgive me- rather cleverer than most men, my mistakes tend to be correspondingly huger.” “People find it a lot easier to forgive others for being wrong than being right.” “It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live.” “Words are, in my not-so-humble opinion, our most inexhaustible source of magic. Capable of both inflicting injury, and remedying it.\" “The pain is part of being human. The fact that you can feel pain like this is your greatest strength.” “To the well organized mind, death is but the next adventure.” “It’s not really goodbye after all.” On a lighter note, it's beautiful Katerina's birthday today, let's spare a few moments to greet her a HAPPIEST BIRTHDAY! Even though you're quite busy for Goodreads and reading atm, I hope you're doing something that's making you happy today!

Times read: 5 One of the best books in this series. It does a great job of combining fun humor with action and heartbreak. My favorite movie is also based off of this book so of course this one will always hold a special place in my heart (although the movie should've included the Room of Requirement subplot because without that, there's a scene in Deathly Hallows Part 2 that doesn't make sense-). The funeral in this book hits harder every time I read. The specific character's death isn't what makes me sad - it's everyone else's reactions, especially Hagrid's. The character (though controversial) meant a lot to so many of the characters and this series wouldn't be the same without him. If you're in the middle of reading this series for the first time, keep reading until you get to this one so that you can experience the highs and lows of Harry's sixth year at Hogwarts. You'll find out about so much stuff that the movie left out and this book is way more fast paced than some of the previous installments. My favorite quotes\/moments from the book: -\"'Will you, Severus, watch over my son, Draco, as he attempts to fulfill the Dark Lord's wishes?' 'I will,' said Snape. A thin tongue of brilliant flame issued from the wand and wound its way around their hands like a red-hot wire. 'And will you, to the best of your ability, to the best of your ability, protect him from harm?' 'I will,' said Snape. A second tongue of flame shot from the wand and interlinked with the first, making a fine, glowing chain. 'And, should it prove necessary... if it seems Draco will fail...' whispered Narcissa (Snape's hand twitched within hers, but he did not draw away), 'will you carry out the deed that the Dark Lord has ordered Draco to perform?' There was a moment's silence. Bellatrix watched, her wand upon their clasped hands, her eyes wide. 'I will,' said Snape. Bellatrix's astounded face glowed red in the blaze of a third tongue of flame, which shot from the wand, twisted with the others, and bound itself thickly around their clasped hands, like a rope, like a fiery snake.\" -\"'Judging by your look of stunned disbelief, Harry did not warn you that I was coming,' said Dumbledore pleasantly. 'However, let us assume that you have invited me warmly into your house.'\" -\"'I would assume that you were going to offer me refreshment,' Dumbledore said to Uncle Vernon, 'but the evidence so far suggests that that would be optimistic to the point of foolishness.'\" -\"The Dursleys, after quick, scared looks at one another, tried to ignore their glasses completely, a difficult feat, as they were nudging them gently on the sides of their heads. Harry could not suppress a suspicion that Dumbledore was rather enjoying himself.\" -\"'You are the rightful owner of number twelve, Grimmauld Place and of Kreacher.' 'Do I - do I have to keep him with me?' Harry asked, aghast as Kreacher thrashed around at his feet. 'Not if you don't want to,' said Dumbledore. 'If I might make a suggestion, you could send him to Hogwarts to work in the kitchen there. In that way, the other house-elves could keep an eye on him.'\" -\"'Hagrid will be delighted,' said Dumbledore, smiling. 'He was thrilled to see Buckbeak again. Incidentally, we have decided, in the interests of Buckbeak's safety, to rechristen him 'Witherwings' for the time being, though I doubt that the Ministry would ever guess he is the hippogriff they once sentenced to death.\" -\"'You have not asked me, for instance, what is my favorite flavor of jam, to check that I am indeed Professor Dumbledore and not an impostor.' 'I didn't...' Harry began, not entirely sure whether he was being reprimanded or not. 'For future reference, Harry, it is raspberry... although of course, if I were a Death Eater, I would have been sure to research my own jam preferences before impersonating myself.'\" -\"And without warning, Dumbledore swooped, plunging the tip of his wand into the seat of the overstuffed armchair, which yelled, 'Ouch!' 'Good evening, Horace,' said Dumbledore, straightening up again. Harry's jaw dropped. Where a split second before there had been an armchair, there now crouched an enormously fat, bald, old man who was massaging his lower belly...\" -\"...he was a big pal of your father's at school. The whole Black family had been in my House, but Sirius ended up in Gryffindor! Shame - he was a talented boy. I got his brother, Regulus, when he came along, but I'd have liked the set.\" -\"All ex-students, all signed. You'll notice Barnabas Cuffe, editor of the Daily Prophet, he's always interested to hear my take on there day's news. And Ambrosius Flume, of Honeydukes - a hamper every birthday, and all because I was able to give him an introduction to Ciceron Harkiss, who gave him his first job! And at the back - you'll see her if you just crane your neck - that's Gwenog Jones, who of course captains the Holyhead Harpies... People are always astonished to hear I'm on first-name terms with the Harpies, and free tickets whenever I want them!\" -\"I hope you will forgive me for mentioning it, Harry, but I am pleased and a little proud at how well you seem to be coping after everything that happened at the Ministry. Permit me to say that I think Sirius would have been proud of you.\" -\"'It was cruel,' said Dumbledore softly, 'that you and Sirius had such a short time together. A brutal ending to what should have been a long and happy relationship.'\" -\"'It's just hard,' Harry said finally, in a low voice, 'to realize he won't write to me again.'\" -\"'...I reazlied I can't shut myself away or - or crack up. Siris wouldn't have wanted that, would he? And anyway, life's too short... Look at Madam Bones, look at Emmeline Vance... It could be me next, couldn't it? But if it is,' he said fiercely, now looking straight into Dumbledore's blue eyes gleaming in the wandlight, 'I'll make sure I take as many Death Eaters with me as I can, and Voldemort too if I can manage it.' 'Spoken both like your mother and father's son and Sirius's true godson!'\" -\"Don't count your owls before they are delivered...\" -\"'Arthur, is that you?' 'Yes,' came Mr. Weasley's weary voice. 'But I would say that even if I were a Death Eater, dear. Ask the question!' 'Oh, honestly...' 'Molly!' 'All right, all right... What is your dearest ambition?' 'To find out how airplanes stay up.'\" -\"'What do you like me to call you when we're alone together?' Even by the dim light of the lantern Harry could tell that Mrs. Weasley had turned bright red; he himself felt suddenly warm around the ears and neck, and hastily gulped soup, clattering his spoon as loudly as he could against the bowl. 'Mollywobbles,' whispered a mortified Mrs. Weasley into the crack at the edge of the door. 'Correct,' said Mr. Weasley. 'Now you can let me in.'\" -\"A young woman was standing in the doorway, a woman of such breathtaking beauty that the room seemed to have become strangely airless. She was tall and willowy with long blonde hair and appeared to emanate a faint, silvery glow. To complete this vision of perfection, she was carrying a heavily laden breakfast tray.\" -\"'You remember my seester, Gabrielle? She never stops talking about 'Arry Potter. She will be delighted to see you again.' 'Oh... is she here too?' Harry croaked. 'No, no, silly boy,' said Fleur with a tinkling laugh, 'I mean next summer, when we - but do you not know?' Her great blue eyes widened and she looked reproachfully at Mrs. Weasley, who said, 'We hadn't got around to telling him yet.' Fleur turned back to Harry, swinging her silvery sheet of hair so that it whipped Mrs. Weasley across the face. 'Bill and I are going to be married!'\" -\"Dumbledore says people find it far easier to forgive others for being wrong than being right...\" -\"Then there was a loud bang and Hermione vanished behind a puff of black smoke. 'Hermione!' shouted Harry and Ron; the breakfast tray slid to the floor with a crash. Hermione emerged, coughing, out of the smoke, clutching the telescope and sporting a brilliantly purplle black eye. 'I squeezed it and it - it punched me!' she gasped. And sure enough, they now saw a tiny fist on a long spring protruding from the end of the telescope.\" -\"He spent most of his days playing two-a-side Quidditch in the Weasleys' orchard (he and Hermione against Ron and Ginny; Hermione was dreadful and Ginny good, so they were reasonably well matched) and his evenings eating triple helpings of everything Mrs. Weasley put in front of him.\" -\"And they've found Igor Karkaroff's body in a shack up north. The Dark Mark had been set over it - well, frankly, I'm surprised he stayed alive for even a year after the Death Eaters; Sirius's brother, Regulus, only managed a few days as far as I can remember.\" -\"'Did you hear about Florean Fortescue, Remus?' asked Bill, who was being plied with wine by Fleur. 'The man who ran-' '-the ice cream place in Diagon Alley?' Harry interrupted, with an unpleasant, hollow sensation in the pit of his stomach. 'He used to give me free ice creams. What's happened to him?' 'Dragged off, by the look of his place.'\" -\"WHY ARE YOU WORRYING ABOUT YOU-KNOW-WHO? YOU SHOULD BE WORRYING ABOUT U-NO-POO - THE CONSTIPATION SENSATION THAT'S GRIPPING THE NATION!\" -\"There were bins full of trick wands, the cheapest merely turning into rubber chickens or pairs of briefs when waved, the most expensive beating the unwary user around the head and neck, and boxes of quills, which came in Self-Inking, Spell-Checking, and Smart-Answer varieties.\" -\"'Patented Daydream Charms...' Hermione had managed to squeeze through to a large display near the counter and was reading the information on the back of a box bearing a highly colored picture of a handsome youth and a swooning girl who were standing on the deck of a pirate ship. 'One simple incantation and you will enter a top-quality, highly realistic, thirty-minute daydream, easy to fit into the average school lesson and virtually undetectable (side effects include vacant expression and minor drooling). Not for sale to under-sixteens. You know,' said Hermione, looking up at Harry, 'that really is extraordinary magic!' 'For that Hermione,' said a voice behind them, 'you can have one for free.' A beaming Fred stood before them, wearing a set of magenta robes that clashed magnificently with his flaming hair.\" -\"'And our Decoy Detonators are just walking off the shelves, look,' said Fred, pointing at a number of weird-looking black horn-type objects that were indeed attempting to scurry out of sight. 'You just drop one surreptitiously and it'll run off and make a nice loud noise out of sight, giving you a diversion if you need one.'\" -\"She was pointing at a number of round balls of fluff in shades of pink and purple, all rolling around the bottom of a cage and emitting high-pitched squeaks. 'Pigmy Puffs,' said George. 'Miniature puff skeins, we can't breed them fast enough.' -\"'That's three Galleons, nine Sickles, and a Knut,' said Fred, examining the many boxes in Ron's arms. 'Cough up.' 'I'm your brother!' 'And that's our stuff you're nicking. Three Galleons, nine Sickles. I'll knock off the Knut.'\" -\"...Bill and I 'ave almost decided on only two bridesmaids, Ginny and Gabrielle will look very sweet togezzer.\" -\"...their departure the following morning was smoother than usual. The Ministry cars glided up to the front of the Burrow to find them waiting, trunks packed; Hermione's cat, Crookshanks. safely enclosed in his traveling basket; and Hedwig; Ron's owl, Pigwidgeon; and Ginny's new purple Pygmy Puff, Arnold, in cages. 'Au revoir, 'Arry,' said Fleur throatily, kissing him good-bye. Ron hurried forward, looking hopeful, but Ginny stuck out her foot and Ron fell, sprawling in the dust at Fleur's feet.\" -\"...indicating Neville's bottom, which was sticking out from under the seat again as he groped around for Trevor, and Luna, who was now wearing her free Spectrespecs, which gave her the look of a demented, multicolored owl. 'They're friends of mine,' said Harry coldly.\" -\"Zabini, who was interrogated after McLaggen, turned out to have a famously beautiful witch for a mother (from what Harry could make out, she had been married seven times, each of her husbands dying mysteriously and leaving her mounds of gold).\" -\"You want to be careful, Blaise! I saw this young lady perform the most marvelous Bat-Bogey Hex as I was passing her carriage! I wouldn't cross her!\" -\"'He saw me hex Zacharias Smith,' said Ginny. 'You remember that idiot from Hufflepuff who was in the D.A.? He kept on and on asking about what happened at the Ministry and in the end he annoyed me so much I hexed him...'\" -\"...she waved her wand; an immense silvery four-legged creature erupted from it and streaked off into the darkness. 'Was that a Patronus?' asked Harry, who had seen Dumbledore send messages like this.\" -\"'I would rather die than betray his trust.' 'That's not saying much, seeing as you're already dead,' Ron observed. 'Once again, you show all the sensitivity of a blunt axe,' said Nearly Headless Nick...\" -\"'My grandmother thinks Charms is a soft option,' mumbled Neville. 'Take Charms,' said Professor McGonagall, 'and I shall drop Augusta a line reminding her that just because she failed her Charms O.W.L., the subject is not necessarily worthless.'\" -\"'Yes,' said Harry stiffly. 'Yes, sir.' 'There's no need to call me 'sir,' Professor.'\" -\"Dear Harry, I would like to start our private lessons this Saturday. Kindly come along to my office at 8 P.M. I hope you are enjoying your first day back at school. Yours sincerely, Albus Dumbledore P.S. I enjoy Acid Pops.\" -\"They chose the one nearest a gold-colored cauldron that was emitting one of the most seductive scents Harry had ever inhaled: Somehow it reminded him simultaneously of treacle tart, the woody smell of a broomstick handle, and something flowery he thought he might have found at the Burrow.\" -\"Good lord, it's clear you've inherited your mother's talent. She was a dab hand at Potions, Lily was! Here you are, then, here you are - one bottle of Felix Felicis, as promised, and use it well!\" -\"...he caught a sudden waft of that flowery smell he had picked up in Slughorn's dungeon. He looked around and saw that Ginny had joined them.\" -\" Hissy, hissy, little snake, Slither on the floor, You be good to Morfin, Or he'll nail you to the door. \" -\"Any Dark object would have been found, I know for a fact Crabbe had a shrunken head confiscated.\" -\"...Harry watched Ginny Weasley playing with Arnold the Pigmy Puff for a while...\" -\"Harry had already attempted a few of the Prince's self-invented spells. There had been a hex that caused toenails to grow alarmingly fast (he had tried this on Crabbe in the corridor, with very entertaining results); a jinx that glued the tongue to the roof of the mouth (which he had twice used, to general applause, on an unsuspecting Argus Filch); and, perhaps most useful of all, Muffliato, a spell that filled the ears of anyone nearby with an unidentifiable buzzing, so that lengthy conversations could be held in class without being overheard.\" -\"POinting his wand at nothing in particular, he gave it an upward flick and said Levicorpus! inside his head. 'Aaaaaaaargh!' There was a flash of light and the room was full of voices: Everyone had woken up as Ron had let out a yell. Harry sent Advanced Potion-Making flying in panic; Ron was dangling upside down in midair as though an invisible hook had hoisted him up by the ankle.\" -\"'There is no way they'd let me be a Death Eater!' said Ron indignantly, a bit of sausage flying off the fork he was now brandishing at Hermione and hitting Ernie Macmillan on the head.\" -\"There is a fund at Hogwarts for those who require assistance to buy books and robes.\" -\"Amidst all the yelling and clapping Harry could distinctly hear the roar of Luna Lovegood's famous lion-topped hat.\" -\"A tall, skinny blond boy with an upturned nose was standing there, talking into the magical megaphone that had once been Lee Jordan's; Harry recognized Zacharias Smith, a Hufflepuff player whom he heartily disliked.\" -\"...Ginny sped right on past them until, with an almighty crash, she collided with the commentator's podium. As the crowd shrieked and laughed, the Gryffindor team landed beside the wreckage of wood under which Zacharias was feebly stirring; Harry heard saying blithely to an irate Professor McGonagall, 'Forgot to brake, Professor, sorry.'\" -\"As he was ducking toward the drinks table, he walked straight into Ginny, Arnold the Pygmy Puff riding on her shoulder and Crookshanks mewing hopefully at her heels.\" -\"She was sitting on the teacher's desk, alone except for a small right of twittering yellow birds circling her head, which she had clearly just conjured out of midair.\" -\" 'Oppugno!' came shriek from the doorway. Harry spun around to see Hermione pointing her wand at Ron, her expression wild; The little flock of birds was speeding like a hail of fat golden bullets toward Ron, who yelped and covered his face with his hands, but the birds attacked, pecking and clawing at every bit of flesh they could reach.\" -\"'Or d'you think she overheard you being rude about Filch? I've always thought there might be something going on between them...' 'Oh, ha ha...' Enjoying the fact that they could speak normally again, they made their way along the deserted, lamp-lit corridors back to the common room, arguing about whether or not Filch and Madam Pince were secretly in love with each other.\" -\"They had just embarked upon the immensely difficult topic of human Transfiguration; working in front of mirrors, they were supposed to be changing the color of their own eyebrows. Hermione laughed unkindly at Ron's disastrous first attempt, during which he somehow managed to give himself a spectacular handlebar mustache...\" -\"'A bit lonely without the D.A. Ginny's been nice, though. She stopped two boys in our Transfiguration class calling me 'Loony' the other day-'\" -And many more that I can't fit here!"

        "text":"Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince .   There were some things I truly loved about this one. I loved how the bulk of the book, nothing crazy happened. It felt like some of the older books and I love that feeling. All the Harry and Dumbledore time we got, the memories of Voldemort’s past (which were very interesting) and of course Harry and Ginny, who I’ve shipped for a while now finally got their shot. That’s the good. There is also a lot of sadness and despair. A very important and influential character dies. Sides are chosen. People you trust turn out to be not who they say they are (or so we think…) The last 2 hours of this 18 hour audio book broke my heart. I almost want to wait a while to do the final book, but I really want to finish these books by the end of 2016 so I better start it straight away. Wish me luck! I know I’ll need it xoxo"

(2) Fudge: \"Is a man alive if he can't be killed? I don't really understand it, and Dumbledore won't explain properly.\" - Well, horcruxes are forbidden knowledge. 06\/25\/2020 - 6% (1) \"A threadbare sofa, an old armchair, and a rickety table stood grouped together in a pool of dim light cast by a candle-filled lamp.\" - How vampire-chic. - Snape's house could use a woman's touch. (2) \"In her fury [Bellatrix] looked slightly mad.\" - I guess she's always in her \"fury\" then. (3) I never hear of wizard divorces... perhaps they make unbreakable vows? 06\/26\/2020 - 9% (1) \"Rufus Scrimgeour ... has succeeded Cornelius Fudge as Minister of Magic. The appointment has largely been greeted with enthusiasm.\" - Appointment? By who? There doesn't appear to be any wizarding monarch or anything. (2) J.K. Rowling does love giving animal descriptions to antagonists: Scrimgeour is \"lionlike,\" Petunia has a \"horsey face,\" Vernon has \"piggy eyes,\" etc. 06\/27\/2020 - 13% (1) We're introduced to the idea of inferi, which are essentially zombies. The lack of a full-blown zombie chase is one of the series' big missed opportunities. (2) \"The wandlight sparkled on [Slughorn's] shiny pate, his prominent eyes, his enormous, silver, walruslike mustache ...\" - Again with the animal descriptors. (3) Gwenog Jones must be the Welshest name ever. 06\/28\/2020 - 17% Harry and Ginny be like, \"I shouldn't have been so happy about that hug.\" (1) Two weeks since last book and Hermione's already at the Burrow when Harry arrives? Poor Hermione's parents. (2) \"Hermione flashed a warning look at Ron, and Ron changed tack at top speed.\" - Already giving each other married couple signals. (3) Hermione: \"I know I failed everything!\" 06\/29\/2020 - 20% (1) Fred to Ginny: \"Moving through boyfriends a bit fast, aren't you?\" - Well, one per year's not so fast. Though, compared to the other Weasleys, I suppose. (2) '\"Our Decoy Detonators are just walking off the shelves, look,\" said Fred, pointing at a number of weird-looking black hooter-type objects.' - I presume \"hooter\" means something different in British English. 06\/30\/2020 - 23% (1) '\"She has let 'erself go, zat Tonks,\" Fleur mused.' - Sounds like Fleur's finally cottoned onto Molly and Ginny's cunning plan to get Bill to dump her for Tonks. (2) In the books, Luna's Spectrespecs are a kind of snake oil novelty. In the film they actually work! Film Luna is treated as more of an eccentric than the books, where she's sort of a lovable gullible. 07\/01\/2020 - 26% Ginny be like: \"Get a room you two.\" (1) It's a mark of Ron and Hermione's closeness that she's comfortable enough to hit him repeatedly with a book, and he's comfortable enough to let her. (2) Nearly Headless Nick: \"I would rather die than betray [Harry's] trust.\" Ron: \"That's not saying much, seeing as you're already dead.\" - Ron again with the common sense. 07\/02\/2020 - 29% Finally! Book-accurate bushy hair! (1) Snape: \"We are practicing nonverbal spells, Potter.\" Harry: \"Yes.\" Snape: \"Yes, sir.\" Harry: \"There's no need to call me 'sir,' Professor.\" - New levels of reckless sass. (2) Harry smells something flowery in the love potion. Just 10 pages later, Harry smells something flowery and turns to see Ginny. - Not exactly subtle. 07\/03\/2020 - 33% (1) The House of Gaunt has a very Craster's Keep vibe to it. (2) Merope seems right out of a Jane Austen novel. (3) Dumbledore: \"The Gaunts [were] noted for a vein of instability and violence that flourished through the generations due to their habit of marrying their own cousins.\" - Not so different than European royals, then... and a fair bit better than Egyptians. 07\/04\/2020 - 36% (1) Ron gets attention from Lavender, Hermione gives him the cold shoulder. Hermione congratulates Ron, Lavender walks off grumpy. Meanwhile, Ron's totally oblivious. (2) Harry: \"But wasn't that dishonest, Hermione? I mean, you're a prefect, aren't you?\" - Hermione gets a taste of her own medicine here, seeing as she says this to Ron all the time, albeit less polite. 07\/05\/2020 - 39% Callback\/Mirroring: You've got something on your face. (1) Harry: \"The Prince had proved a much more effective teacher than Snape so far.\" - Oh the irony. (2) Hermione: \"Ron, what are you staring at?\" Ron: \"Nothing.\" Hermione: \"I expect 'nothing's' in the back getting more firewhisky.\" - Ron crushing on Madam Rosmerta and Hermione being jealous never gets old. 07\/06\/2020 - 42% (1) Wonder if Caractacus Burke was named after the Briton chieftain or the dad from Chitty-Chitty-Bang-Bang? (2) Orphanage matron: \"He was to be named Tom, for his father, and Marvolo, for her father — yes, I know, funny name, isn't it? We wondered whether she came from a circus.\" - Hmm... The Great Marvolo! (3) Young Voldemort owning a harmonica is just plain funny. 07\/07\/2020 - 44% (1) Harry: \"What if Ron and Hermione started going out together, then split up? Could their friendship survive it?\" - Depends how much they enjoy bickering... it's kind of their thing. (2) \"What if they didn't split up? What if ... it became excruciatingly embarrassing to be in their presence, so that he was shut out for good?\" - Classic third-wheel talk right there. 07\/08\/2020 - 46% (1) Harry: \"Ginny, don't call Ron a prat, you're not the Captain of this team.\" Ginny: \"Well, you seemed too busy to call him a prat.\" - Can't fault the logic. (2) Ginny teases Ron for \"never snogg[ing] anyone in his life.\" She also tells Ron \"Hermione snogged Viktor Krum.\" Enraged and shamed, Ron snogs stalkerish Lavender Brown. Ergo, Ginny's to blame for that mess. 07\/09\/2020 - 48% Ron makes Hermione cry on stairs a lot. (1) Ron: \"She can't complain ... She snogged Krum. So she's found out someone wants to snog me too ... I haven't done anything wrong.\" - Ron's not wrong, but misses the point. (2) Hermione: \"He's at perfect liberty to kiss whomever he likes ... I really couldn't care less.\" - She sure talks about it a lot for not caring. 07\/10\/2020 - 49% (1) '\"Are you going out with [Cormac], then?\" asked Parvati, wide-eyed. \"Oh — yes — didn't you know?\" said Hermione, with a most un-Hermione-ish giggle.' - I doubt there's even a Hermione-ish giggle. Mostly she blushes. (2) Harry: \"Serves you right for coming with [Cormac].\" Hermione: \"I thought he'd annoy Ron most.\" - I expect no less from a jealousy-fueled romance. 07\/11\/2020 - 51% (1) \"Harry ... was still trying not to think about Ginny any more than he could help, despite the fact that she kept cropping up in his dreams in ways that made him devoutly thankful that Ron could not perform Legilimency.\" - Hopefully those dreams aren't Voldemort's doing. (2) \"Harry was left to ponder in silence the depths to which girls would sink to get revenge.\" 07\/12\/2020 - 53% Harry and Ginny be like: Not cool bro! (1) Kreacher gifts Harry a box of maggots. Not useful, but it's the thought that counts. (2) '\"Harry, you've got a maggot in your hair,' said Ginny cheerfully, leaning across the table to pick it out; Harry felt goose bumps erupt up his neck that had nothing to do with the maggot.' - Most romantic maggot scene in fiction? 07\/13\/2020 - 56% (1) \"Abstinence\" is the new common room password. Sneaky, having students recite it repeatedly. (2) Harry: \"Hermione, can't you [make up with Ron]?\" Hermione: \"No, I can't... So don't even ask.\" - Can't or won't? (3) \"The contents proved difficult to empty into the Pensieve, as though they had congealed slightly; did memories go bad?\" - Eh, only the regrettable ones. 07\/14\/2020 - 58% (1) Hermione: \"Oh, well, if Won-Won thinks that, you'd better do it ... After all, when has Won-Won's judgment ever been faulty?\" - It's contagious! Now Hermione's saying \"Won-Won.\" Sarcasm, yes, but \"Won-Won\" regardless. (2) \"Friends they might be, but if Ron started calling Lavender 'Lav-Lav,' [Harry] would have to put his foot down.\" - The buck stops at \"Lav-Lav\"! 07\/15\/2020 - 60% Poor Lavender :( (1) Hermione: \"Golpalott's Third Law states that the antidote for a blended poison will be equal to more than the sum of the antidotes for each of the separate components.\" - That makes no sense! How can something be equal to more than a sum? It would just be greater than it! (2) The gif never happens in the book, but it's my favorite scene :) 07\/16\/2020 - 62% (1) \"[Harry] was now being dogged wherever he went by Cormac McLaggen and Lavender Brown. He could not decide which of them was more annoying.\" - I vote Lavender. (2) \"Harry's imagination zoomed into overdrive ... Ginny, weeping over his lifeless form, confessed her feelings of deep attraction to him while Ron gave them his blessing.\" - Pretty passive ambition there. 07\/17\/2020 - 64% (1) Lavender: \"Is Hermione Granger still visiting [Ron]?\" Harry: \"Yeah, I think so. Well, they're friends, aren't they?\" Lavender: \"Friends, don't make me laugh ... She didn't talk to him for weeks after he started going out with me! But I suppose she wants to make up with him now he's all interesting.\" - Now we know what Lavender looks for in a partner. Interesting. 07\/18\/2020 - 68% (1) Lavender to Ron: \"Why didn't you tell me you were getting out today? And why was she with you?\" - I suppose a condition of being Lavender's boyfriend is having to cut loose all your female friends. (2) Voldemort: \"You are omniscient as ever, Dumbledore.\" Dumbledore: \"Oh no, merely friendly with the local barmen.\" - That's some stealthy foreshadowing there. 07\/19\/2020 - 71% (1) Ron: \"I love you, Hermione.\" Hermione: \"Don't let Lavender hear you saying that.\" Ron: \"I won't ... Or maybe I will ... then she'll ditch me.\" - Essentially, that's what happened in the film. (2) The Imperius Curse = Temporary insanity defense. (3) Harry supposes Tonks was in love with Sirius, which no one thinks is weird. Wizard views on incest are oddly casual. 07\/20\/2020 - 73% (1) Ron: \"Quick, hide me!\" Hermione: \"It isn't Lavender!\" - If it were Lavender, I think hiding behind Hermione would make things much worse. (2) Harry hesitates to use his vial of Felix Felicis, having saved it to break up Ginny and Dean. Luckily, that happened as a side effect of his Slughorn mission. So, bonus points. - Incidentally, Harry's low-key a homewrecker. 07\/21\/2020 - 75% (1) '\"What were you doing up there with her?\" shrieked Lavender Brown, staring right through Harry at Ron and Hermione emerging together from the boys' dormitories.' - Lavender's suspicions confirmed! - Lucky all around... except Lavender. (2) Slughorn: \"Had a house-elf taste every bottle after what happened to your poor friend Rupert.\" - I see what she did there :) 07\/22\/2020 - 78% (1) '\"You have [uncommon skill and power],\" said Dumbledore firmly. \"You have a power that Voldemort has never had. You can —\" \"I know!\" said Harry impatiently. \"I can love!\" It was only with difficulty that he stopped himself adding, \"Big deal!\".' - I had the same reaction as Harry to the ending of \"The Fifth Element.\" \"Really? Love is the greatest power there is?\" 07\/23\/2020 - 82% (1) Flitwick: \"A little less talk, a little more action.\" - Wasn't that an Elvis song? No, wait, that was \"A Little Less Conversation.\" (2) Harry's mind: \"She's Ron's sister. But she's ditched Dean! She's still Ron's sister. I'm his best mate! That'll make it worse. If I talked to him first — He'd hit you. What if I don't care? He's your best mate!\" - Ron, Ron, Ron. 07\/24\/2020 - 85% (1) Ginny: \"All Romilda Vane does is ask me if it's true you've got a hippogriff tattooed across your chest ... I told her it's a Hungarian Horntail ... Much more macho.\" - Harry's already kinda got a lightning bolt tattoo, and on his face too! I'd guess that's be even more macho. (2) \"Rage and resentment fought shock and excitement.\" - Fight it! Angst was so Book 5. 07\/25\/2020 - 86% (1) Perhaps Harry's grown too used to magic. He's fine charging headlong into danger, but a short swim in cold water totally freaks him out. Who is he? Film-Ron? (2) \"Harry had long since learned that bangs and smoke were more often the marks of ineptitude than expertise.\" - I wonder if he's referring to Seamus, who's gimmick is he often accidentally blows things up? 07\/26\/2020 - 87% (1) How is Harry shocked that blood magic is a thing? Voldemort was revived by his blood! (2) Dumbldore: \"You are underage and unqualified. Voldemort would never have expected a sixteen-year-old to reach this place: I think it unlikely that your powers will register compared to mine.\" - So... Harry should be glad the alarm can't detect his negligible amount of magic. 07\/27\/2020 - 88% (1) Harry needs blood to open the archway. Luckily, he was already cut whilst fighting Inferi. Even zombies have a silver lining. (2) '\"It's going to be all right, sir,\" Harry said over and over again ... \"Don't worry...\" \"I am not worried, Harry,\" said Dumbledore, his voice a little stronger despite the freezing water. \"I am with you.\"' - Hits me right in the feels. *character limit Click here for the rest [\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>"

They may have been put under the Imperius Curse.\" Time for interesting little subplots is over. We've arrived finally, where everything is closely tied to the core of the story and progressing fast. It's always delightful to see, everything that was great about the series still remains the same, if not better. However, disappointments, sorrow and hardships are what the reader is going to encounter for the most part. As I finished reading Half-Blood Prince, more than ever before, I feel being trapped in a hopeless situation filled with nothing but forebodings. \"Destination...determination...deliberation...\" One would imagine, we're beyond being accommodated with new characters, but the author will quickly convince you otherwise, and introduction of new and interesting characters continues. It's great to see how Rowling keeps outperforming herself with each new book . Harry's ill-tempered nature and suspicions does not end with the last book as I hoped it would, but the results are quite the opposite this time around. Honestly, I did not anticipate the way how things turned out right till the last three chapters. \"To friendship! To generosity! To ten Galleons a hair! We've been somewhat used to happy ending in the first four books (relatively) with 5th being a bit disappointing but this one, it was the most depressing ending for me yet. It probably comes down to reinforcing the suspense toward the final book but, it's a difficult place to be in - especially if you had to wait for a year.. \"Eet 'as been too long!\""

The Half-Blood prince was considerably darker than the previous 5 books, and I just adore how this series has progressed and grown just like most of its readers have. Obviously I knew what the big reveal was prior to finishing the book due to my viewing the films before, but it didn't take away from the experience the novel had to offer. I have this nervous lump in my throat knowing that the next book is the final one, but am simultaneously excited to finally read what the films surely have left out surrounding the conclusion of the series."

Severus, who sacrificed his own soul. Severus, who loved another more than life itself. Severus, the half-blood prince- the truth about his character was, and will likely always be, one of the most surprising twists I’ve ever read in fiction. The set up is all in this book."

        "text":"I was first introduced to Harry Potter in a Children’s Lit class in college. I had resisted this popular phenomenon until I was forced to pick it up for a grade, and Book 1 was short enough that I could read it in the course of 2 hours. I have to admit I wasn’t impressed to any extent, nor did I dislike the experience, but I was critical on grounds of its being derivative, even if reading the first led to reading the second. After all, if I was bored and looking for something light, I could do worse than a fantasy about a child wizard who fights evil with his friends. But it was really the third book, with its increasing darkness, that took me in and made me a fan. With a movie coming out for Order of Phoenix and Deathly Hallows on the horizon, I decided I would reread Half-Blood Prince. I figured it would take four sittings, of course, with its 600 pages, but time does fly when reading this one, and I’ve come to the conclusion that this is my favorite so far. What I wouldn’t have been willing to admit in college that I’m perfectly comfortable saying now is that J.K. Rowling is a fantastic storyteller; she writes with great clarity, wit, and humor; and she’s created a cast of loveable characters with whom most people, due to the common experience of growing up, can relate closely. That said, the reason for my preference for the 6th book is that it’s the most emotionally rich in the series. Here we get the backstory of Voldemort (*spoiler alert*) through a series of flashbacks (coming in HP by way of magically extracted memories), and in this way, we come to understand the villain’s similarities and differences with our hero. After all, the villain has to have reasons for committing heinous acts, and until now, we don’t know what these are. Voldemort is from a once-powerful wizard family reduced to poverty that lives in a dilapidated hovel on the edge of a small town, wary of outsiders, and their main point of pride is their pure blood, the lineage having cross-bred for generations so as not to pollute the line. Voldemort’s mother lives with her father and brother and yearns for the love of a nonmagical man (“muggle” in this world) and when her father and brother are arrested, she uses the opportunity to bewitch her beloved and run off. She ends up pregnant, the man deserts her, and she dies while giving birth to her half-wizard, half-muggle son, thus making him an orphan (like Harry). (Faulkner anyone?) But whereas Harry comes to Hogwarts and befriends Ron and Hermione creating unity and strength through positive emotions, Voldemort, when growing in the orphanage shuns other children, torturing them at times (without the awareness of adults) and stealing their possessions. What fuels him is his hatred of his beginnings, his mother’s weakness at having died like a common person despite being a witch, and the “muggle” blood inherited from his father. Over the course of his time at Hogwarts, Voldemort, charming as only evil can be, learns to win over people as a means to an end and disguise his insidious purposes, but he never befriends anyone. He moves, through his hatred, further away from many of the emotions that drive Harry, namely the desire to protect the people he loves and avenge his parents’ death. With Dumbledore’s help in exploring Voldemort’s past, Harry begins to understand that he’s come to be where he is through the choices he’s made, that his greatest strengths are an alliance with his friends, and that this might hold the key to destroying his enemy, a fact that’s made all the more poignant when Dumbledore, in an all-out assault on Hogwarts by Voldemort’s Death Eaters, is killed at the end. The stakes are higher than before, the action and pace increase as the conclusion draws near, and things are looking darker than ever, which is the setup that any fan wants when the end is looming and it leaves us with the question: How will our hero prevail?"

        "text":"Reminder that all of my Harry Potter reviews contain unmarked spoilers, and lots of ’em. If you’re one of the two people on Goodreads who hasn’t read this series, this review is not for you. So, my dear underside-of-a-rock-residing friends: https:\/\/emmareadstoomuch.wordpress.co... This review will be interesting, because this book was far (far, far) from perfect, and yet I am utterly determined to give it 5 stars. (Which I have only given to the first book in this series.) God, how do you talk about this book? It’s really amazing. It is really hard for me to feel anything while reading a book or generally living my life . For example, I felt nothing when Sirius died. Nothing throughout most of this series, actually. And nothing in this book, because nothing happened and everyone survived and everything is sunshiney and joyful! Ugh. I tried. The last hundred-ish pages of this book really tore me apart. Okay, even that’s not true. I’ll just come out and say it: I’m really f*cking sad that Dumbledore died. I love him so much. He’s high up in my top 5 characters. (Do I even have a top 5?) I’m devastated, which makes me even more upset, because I have a life to live today and can’t just lay around and wallow in fictional pain. I’m going to move on in the hopes that I just. Forget. Because I don’t like this at ALL. Here, we see Harry Potter - who, I think few will argue, has been a fairly mediocre character up to this point - become AMAZING. He’s motivated solely by his need to work against injustice and evil. He realizes his parents’ legacy within himself. He denounces the sucking up of others. He works hard in school! He is a good friend even when his two BFFS are being childish to one another plus refusing to believe him. In short, he’s really, really, five-star-level great here. Gorgeous character development in 650 pages. I didn’t think I liked Ginny much, because I didn’t remember this book well...like, at all. But she is so great! So funny. I wish there was more of her in this book. Also, I’ll fight anyone who says Dumbledore is ~the real villain~ of this series. He’s really not. (Cough, Snape is, cough.) AND YOU'RE NOT EDGY, PEOPLE WHO HATE DUMBLEDORE BUT LOVE SNAPE. YOU'RE JUST DUMB. I fell deeply in love with the guy. (Dumbledore, not Snape. BLEH.) AND I F*CKING MISS HIM. Goddamn it. Trying to forget didn’t last very long. Anyway. I missed Hermione and Neville. Hermione was absolutely not well-represented here at all. Maybe it’s a good thing she’s not a Ravenclaw (#RavenclawPride) because she works fully against logic throughout this book. And when she’s not she just, like, refuses to believe Harry. Ron is soooooooooo annoying! Is he anyone’s favorite character? He’s like, Fred or George if one of them was totally childish and attention-starved and mean. In fact, Ronald is a pretty impressive character for the number of gross character traits he embodies despite being supposed to be a good character. Mean, immature, rude, jealous, definition of an inferiority complex. Bleh. Harry and Ginny I’m totally for, BUT THE OTHER RELATIONSHIPS IN THIS BOOK ARE SO BORING. Can we do Hermione and Fred instead? Ron and Luna would be cute. Or, God forbid, some LGBT representation? WE KNOW YOU’RE A SUPPORTER, JOANNE. Don’t even get me started on Lupin and Tonks. Speaking of supposedly-good characters’ downfalls: I’m no longer a Hagrid fan. It started with the last book and came fully around here. Like, at a certain point, the man needs a character trait. Liking weird animals, making bad food, and being humongous don’t count. Harry and Hermione’s constant stubbornness is annoying. Plus makes the plot repetitive once in a while. Also, Tonks. You know what, I guess I AM going to get started on Lupin and Tonks! She was a hilarious badass in the last book, totally depressed and weak in this one. I know I sound like a total emotionless asshole here, but that’s who I am, and she’s annoying in this book. AND IT’S TOTALLY FINE BECAUSE SHE’S JUST BEING A SPINELESS IDIOT OVER SOME DUMB SHABBY MAN. Kill me, please. Then I can see my beloved Dumbledore again. Too much Snape. (Cannot WAIT to write the rant on him.) Too much Draco. (Why do people romanticize that little weirdo so much? I guess I get the temptation, but he’s a bully at best and a spineless traitor at worst.) I hate Kreacher and I hate Dobby...I hated Winky, too...I might hate house elves. If that makes me racist against a species of fictional character, SO BE IT, I GUESS. I miss Fred and George, and the fun people from the Order (if they existed), and Hermione and Neville aren’t here nearly enough. The price of Harry’s amazing and concise character development is WAY too many bad characters, not nearly enough of the good ones. EXCEPT DUMBLEDORE. UGHHHH. I’M SO SAD. (I think my inability to cry is making this worse. Maybe if I just creepily sobbed in front of my roommate for a few minutes I’d feel better. Damn you, my lack of emotions! Just kidding love you.) But I want to give this book five stars more than anything. It was so compulsively readable, more than any other book since the first for me. And it’s the last book where our pals are attending Hogwarts. That makes me so sad. It’s such a gorgeous setting and I’m going to miss it so much. WHY IS THIS BOOK SO SAD?! If Deathly Hallows is any sadder I’ll be seriously impressed. And also seriously screwed. And, okay, even though I was a harsh critic of these books...I’m really going to miss this series. I’ve been rereading it on and off (obviously) for three months, and it’s been a fun ride. This is one of the greatest settings of all time. And since I’m rereading it after 10 years, it’s like saying goodbye twice. AND I HATE ENDINGS. Bottom line: Okay, THIS is my favorite Harry Potter book. (Anyone else’s?) Unreal character development + tragic and lovely adieu to a gorgeous setting + ability to make me feel real, deep emotion + compulsively readable? An absolute dream. ----------ORIGINAL REVIEW--------------- Ron and Hermione's will-they-won't-they is a total snoozefest. I propose Fred & Hermione and Ron & Luna instead. Also seven more books!"

        "text":"For a long time this book had a special place in my freezer with my favorite ice creams and frozen food I was banned to cook (I eventually burn them when I defreeze them. I was born with non-culinary skills!) I repeated what Joey Tribbianni did because after finishing this book I cried so hard, I cursed nonstop, I screamed till my local cords declare their uselessness and I tried to throw the hardcopy out of the window but I changed my mind because an innocent kid may have found the book at the outside and started to read and cry nonstop! So instead of throwing away or burning the pages( which is so harsh punishment because this book is still a classic and it’s one of the best ones of the series)freezing the book and never forgiving the author for killing one of my favorite characters were the best choices I’ve had. As my new weekend quarantine habit: I started retro weekend tradition and reread my favorite series. Even though this book broke my heart more than a decade before, at least this time I prepared myself with lots of tissues and golden toilet papers( they’re so precious things and I hang them on the walls with hand sanitizers as if they’re historical artifacts.) and I bottled up my happy memories inside my head to protect my heart tear apart. This is sweet 16 adventures of Harry: the girl crushes, secret smiles, hormonal and characteristic changes, seeing the world from different aspect! If I didn’t get so sad with the unexpected ending, this might be second favorite HP book because JKR- wizard of the words reflected the emotional and psychical changing as they grow up more and realize the biggest danger out there to steal their best times of their lives. I never get bored to reread any HP books or anything JKR writes. (instead of shopping list. Lately they made me sleep!) So I had quite great time with my nostalgic journey to the past and realize I will find myself reading these books a decade later and I will still get the great taste of literature and have quality time. That’s the magic of skilled writing and gifted talent!"

        "text":"Second Reread Review: REVIEW TO COME SOON ••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••• 5 GLOWING MAGICAL STARS! 'Dumbledore says people find it far easier to forgive others for being wrong than being right,' said Hermione. 'I heard him telling your mum, Ron.' I'm really enjoying this series so far but this series gets darker and darker. the first three of this series were so funny and cute even though there were sad scenes on them and the fourth, fifth and sixth books contained so much pain and I even shed more tears for these book than I did for the the first three. I have lost a favorite character that always made me laugh and smile. this character is Sirus Black. I even still can't get over his death. but let's admit it that maybe there's a death of character that we will never get over. *takes deep breath* okay let's talk about this book ・。・゜★・。・。☆・゜・。・゜。・。・゜★・。・。☆・。・゜★・。・。 PHLEGM I have never liked Fleur Delacour very much since I first saw her on the book four and then I saw her again on the book four as Bill's girlfriend or Fiancee and I also laughed when Ginny called Fleur Phlegm. I also still don't how Bill fell in love with her but yeah, she is pretty but I thought Bill deserved someone better than her. I like Bill so much. he is so cool with his red long hair. maybe I didn't like Phlegm because I was jealous hahahaha okay it is not maybe, I was jealous. but look at this scene : ''E is always so thoughtful,' purred Fleur adoringly, stroking Bill's nose. Ginny mimed vomiting into her cereal behind Fleur. Harry choked over his cornflakes and Ron thumped him on the back. ugh ... how could I like her if she acted like that?!? that was really annoying and Ginny also found it disgusting. Hermione and Ginny didn't even like her. but she changed my mind on the the end of this book because when Bill was attacked by ... that werewolf guy who bit Remus when he was a kid. Bill is no longer as handsome as he used to be but Fleur still loves him. she doesn't care about how he looks and I even thought she would leave him after he was attacked but she didn't and that time I changed my mind about her. She is the right girl for Bill, even though I am a little bit jealous hahaha xD Ron and Hermione I ship these two so much and I really really like Ron. Ron and Hermione are always funny. they always bicker about something and I think the first time Ron fell in love with Hermione was on the book four because he was so angry when he knew Hermione went to the Yule Ball with Viktor Krum and in this book Ron hurt me so much. He thought that Hermione kissed Krum and he was so angry and jealous because of this and he kissed Lavender in the common room that was full of people and it also broke Hermione's heart. Harry looked into the corner she was indicating. There, in full view of the whole room, stood Ron wrapped so closely around Lavender Brown it was hard to tell whose hands were whose. And I was so angry in that moment 'Er - my - nee,' croaked Ron unexpectedly from between them. but all my anger was gone when he was poisoned and he said that while he was asleep. I think he was trying to say Hermione, so that meant he dreamt about her and I forgave him that exact time and he also didn't really like Lavender anymore since then. he even pretended to be asleep when Lavender came to visit him in the hospital wing. so that meant he didn't like her anymore and I don't think he actually liked Lavender before he was poisoned. I think he just kissed Lavender because he wanted to make Hermione jealous and feel hurt, which he successfully did. Harry And Ginny have you ever thought why Ginny had relationship with quite many guys? wait ... not many guys because she just dated two boys, Dean and Michael. But she always got a boyfriend as soon as she split up with her ex and my thoughs about this is probably right because Ginny said this to Harry on the end of the book 'I never really gave up on you,' she said. 'Not really. I always hoped ... Hermione told me to get on with life, maybe go out with some other people, relax a bit around you, because I never used to be able to talk if you were in the room, remember? And she thought you might take a bit more notice if I was a bit more - myself.' I think Ginny always dated a guy as soon as she split up with her ex because she always tried to forget Harry, so maybe if she had a boyfriend, she wouldn't love Harry anymore. But according to what she said she never really gave up on Harry so that means she has always loved him. I was a bit sad when Harry said they can't be together again because Harry was afraid if something would happen to Ginny if they kept seeing each other. he was afraid if Voldemort used Ginny to get him. but I didn't angry with him because this just proved how much Harry loves Ginny and I am sure they will be together again. I hope so ... Dumbledore's death I admit that Dumbledore is not one of my top favorite characters in this series but I always found him funny and a bit weird, in a good way, of course. But his death left me in shock because he was actually pleading to Snape but Snape killed him with The Avada Kedavra curse and I thought Snape was on the good side. What will happen now after Dumbledore died?! He is the only one Voldemort is afraid of. I have this feeling that I'll to lose my favorite characters again ... thank you so much for reading and liking my review. hope you all have a great weekend, guys!"

        "text":"4.5 Golden Stars 92% yeah, it was dark, but probably the most Hilarious book of HP; it IS a Comedy! I was rolling in laughter! Hilarious Ron, sassy Harry & Hermione's wittiness & the unique fun in the writing style, the impression, the descriptions, the comparisons. anyway, don't get mad at me, but this book is my least favourite in Harry Potter series. it was kind of disappointment for me. 3 years gap, reading the other fantastic books many times, guessing & after that shocking end in book 5, looking forward to this one, to be greater than others as we are close to end... in one sentence: I was not satisfied after reading it. (IK the book was the calm before the storm, but still.) & don't get me wrong; it was a disappointment Only compared to other HP books. Boring start. (2 chapters without anything related to Hogwarts or the golden trio) Harry was obsessed with what Malfoy was up to, the whole year & for the first time, I found Harry annoying. risking for no good reason, only his hunch. maybe this is the main reason I didn't like this book. (I hate 'Sectumsempra' chapter , always get mad at him.) always yelling: Don't! No! you idiot, Harry! because he is my favourite character... (though now after many times re-reading, at some points, I found those parts hilarious too, ) at the end, he was right though. also, lack of funny sarcastic retorts between Harry & Draco :( almost whole events were like side-jobs (except the... you-know-what) A.K.A the Slug club truth: I don't care about Slughorn either. those chapter he just talked & talked about celebrities once-were-his students... ughhhh. Adrenaline peak parts were not satisfying & not enough (amounts). the whole story was a bit ordinary & nothing happened in the whole school year, in particular. (like school wasn't at an immediate, solid grave danger (book 2, 3, 7 & maybe 5), the golden trio wasn't solving mysteries (1, 2, 4, 5, 7) or something as intriguing as these. they were just attending classes, boring parties, slug club & these normal stuff. though I like the classes & the Hogwarts routine, justt ass I enjoyed in book 5. whenever I missed Hogwarts this book, along with 5, is my go-to. just the Slug club ruined it a little. but in total, other parts (except Malfoy & Slug club); maybe not high peak of adrenaline (as I said), but interesting, & funny; we all wanted to know who the half-blood prince was, Quidditch was great as always & the parts with Dumbledore were fascinating. I liked the second half of the book more, like finally this book stepped into action! & that end was the \"Beginning of the End\"! But main reason: his obsession with Malfoy; 'OMG! Harry, just come off it!' , therefore Harry being annoying, therefore lack of Harry's sarcasm comebacks with Malfoy, lowered this book to my least favourite. However.... on the bright side, there are parts I love too: ❤ sassy Harry was the best! There's no need to call me \"sir\", professor. Bless you JKR! Bless you Harry Potter! one of the sassiest comments in the history of sass masters! my first reaction when I see this, was: whaaaa!?... then \"omg! Harry! did you just...!?\" & re-read the sentence to see if I got it right & then... putting the book down ( \"Hail Harry Potter!\" ) & burst out laughing! & that's that, ever since! although there was no sarcastic comebacks between Potter & Malfoy, but this book had many funny moments by other characters. \"Well, you can’t break an Unbreakable Vow...\" (Gee! Thanks Ron!) \"I’d worked that much out for myself, funnily enough!” & Harry was not just being sassy & sarcastic, but also being funny & clueless too, which was laughable. Ron's jokes with ghosts always made me choke with laughter! ❤ Friendships Harry & Ron's friendship (always one of my favourite brotps) funny, great, looking after each other. always love it, in all books. Roonil Wazlib! also Harry & Hermione's. (especially after Ron & Hermione's bickering), beautiful, caring, protective. again, I love it in all the books. I actually noticed after years of rereading, now Romione has lowered in its place for me & I ship these two more. they care so much for each other. (I'm thinking it's probably also a brotp. well, it's complicated to decide if I want to accept the canon (because I do love canon too) or my mind. the point is, I love the moments with these two together :) ❤ the writing style is just Unique & perfect & funny! ❤ my favourite chapters are \"the Cave\" & \"Horcruxes\"; awesome, exciting with unexpected amount of surprises. I actually loved them. I loved the main-stream parts with Dumbledore. I loved how Harry, at some points, admired Tom. & how he unfolded this story & also sympathized with other characters. ❤ I liked Dumbledore in this book. ❤ at least after that terrible mistake (mentioned above), the chapter ended beautifully; my favourite part, that magical romantic moment, how well described, what a glamorous scene. My first ship finally sinking! \"... After several long moments, or it might have been half an hour-or possibly several sunlit days- they broke apart. The creature in his chest roaring in triumph.\" (& I was really angry when the movie CHANGED this scene! actually I really loved the first 3 movies (they were so similar to the books) & 5 too (tho it was a bit different & they mostly deleted the humor parts), 4 was similar enough, just darker than my imagination. but movies 6 & 7 just had the same quotes (almost) & changed or deleted scenes a lot, therefore those completely disappointed me. :( ❤ & I was proud Harry became Team Captain ! Quidditch were funny, especially the first one ( You Clever Harry! XD ). except not the commentator, but Harry made a funny moment of that too ;) ❤ Don't forget how Gracefully this book was written. (& how delicately Rowling chose to show they were swearing without any direct swears. I love it. it doesn't make me apprehensive, on the contrary, it makes me laugh very hard & respect the pure talent.) Hail Queen! 10th read ; November 2019: I could've given 5 Stars because of Sassy Harry (I mean, Harry just being savagely Sassy this year! XD) & beautiful, magnificent choices of the words & compare to a few of my 5 stars this book definitely deserves 5; but I'm not satisfied with it (still things that annoy me) so I probably won't. Although there's a progress, the rating score has risen to 4.5 now. 13th read ; June 2022: never have read this book this quick! thanks to BR with my new Potterhead !

There were things I'd forgotten, e.g. how late Harry and Ginny got together. I'd also forgotten about most of the funeral. I'll say no more, spoilers oblige . What this book tells me is that sadly the more conservative of readers, grammarians etc will place so many books above Harry Potter #6, none of which is worth mentioning in the same breath as Potter lore. To me this series is special. Nobody else will undertake waiting for each book to come out and lay our hands on them. The Potter universe will belong to our descendants forever. But it was we who helped create this fervor and unmatched popularity."

It's the first time that the Muggle world and the magic one come bluntly face to face. J.K. Rowling chooses that the first chapter of this novel is the right time for this interaction, highlighting the dramatic situation and the necessary cooperation to stem the enemy of all: Lord Voldemort. The bedtime reading for my daughter became less lighthearted and more serious by now. Luckily, for some difficult questions Dumbledore bails me out every time: «It is the unknown we fear when we look upon death and darkness, nothing more» We're almost there, the end of the journey is close. Unfortunately, it will never be the same. Vote: 9 «Era quasi mezzanotte e il Primo Ministro stava seduto da solo nel suo ufficio, a leggere una lunga relazione che gli scivolava via dalla mente senza lasciare la minima traccia» A seguito dei numerosi attacchi dei mangiamorte, Il nuovo Ministro della Magia Rufus Scrimgeour, fresco di nomina, decide di incontrare il Primo Ministro britannico babbano... E' la prima volta che il mondo babbano e quello magico si trovano ad interloquire senza mezzi termini. J.K. Rowling decide che il primo capitolo è il momento giusto per questa interazione, a sottolineare la drammaticità della situazione e la necessaria collaborazione allo scopo di arginare il nemico di tutti: Voldemort. Oramai la lettura serale per mia figlia si è fatta decisamente meno spensierata e più impegnata.

Harry’s Quidditch Captain! Yaaas! 3. Weasleys’ Wizzard Wheezes (Say this ten times) 4. Malfoy’s head on Pansy Parkinson’s lap and Pansy stroking his head. *shudders* 5. Slughorn’s belly preceded him out of the door. Bahaha 6. Potions class has never been this cheerful. Thanks Grampy Sloghorn and Harry has never performed better. Thanks to cheating. Lol. 7. Ron, you bollocks! Stop being an idiot, WonWon! 8. Voldemort as a student seems to me even more sinister than the Dark Lord he already is. *shivers* 9. Like Harry, I am Dumbledore’s man through and through. Take that, Rufus! 10. I’d go back to school anytime if it meant having Professor Dumbledore as a teacher. 11. Aherm! Why do you keep looking for Ginny, now Harry? 12. There’s a reason a Dark Arts teacher stays only for a year. It’s all clear now. 13. Who would have thought that the once timid Ginny will blossom into a confident, beautiful, charming, funny and best of all, snarky girl? 14. Chapter 24 will particularly make you swoon! Gaaah! I ship Harry and Ginny! <3 15. RIP, Aragog. 16. For the first time, I solved the mystery! I have guessed early on in the story that the Half Blood Prince was Snape! Yaaas! 17. I knew there was a reason Harry spent so much time with Professor Dumbledore. I can’t… *sobs* Some of the things\/characters missing in the movie: 1. Kreacher and Dobby 2. Bill and Fleur 3. Dumbledore’s Army and the Order of the Phoenix putting up a fight against the Dark Eaters. 4. . Harry breaking up with Ginny which reminds me of Peter Parker and Mj. Finally, as a simple tribute to the wisest, kindest, most revered and one of the most powerful wizards (whose death out of the many deaths hurts me the most that I cried so much, I may have cried harder than Hagrid), the following is a collection of a few of his great thoughts and words that’ll be forever etched in our hearts. *sniffs* “In fact, being-forgive me- rather cleverer than most men, my mistakes tend to be correspondingly huger.” “People find it a lot easier to forgive others for being wrong than being right.” “It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live.” “Words are, in my not-so-humble opinion, our most inexhaustible source of magic. Capable of both inflicting injury, and remedying it.\" “The pain is part of being human. The fact that you can feel pain like this is your greatest strength.” “To the well organized mind, death is but the next adventure.” “It’s not really goodbye after all.” On a lighter note, it's beautiful Katerina's birthday today, let's spare a few moments to greet her a HAPPIEST BIRTHDAY! Even though you're quite busy for Goodreads and reading atm, I hope you're doing something that's making you happy today!

Times read: 5 One of the best books in this series. It does a great job of combining fun humor with action and heartbreak. My favorite movie is also based off of this book so of course this one will always hold a special place in my heart (although the movie should've included the Room of Requirement subplot because without that, there's a scene in Deathly Hallows Part 2 that doesn't make sense-). The funeral in this book hits harder every time I read. The specific character's death isn't what makes me sad - it's everyone else's reactions, especially Hagrid's. The character (though controversial) meant a lot to so many of the characters and this series wouldn't be the same without him. If you're in the middle of reading this series for the first time, keep reading until you get to this one so that you can experience the highs and lows of Harry's sixth year at Hogwarts. You'll find out about so much stuff that the movie left out and this book is way more fast paced than some of the previous installments. My favorite quotes\/moments from the book: -\"'Will you, Severus, watch over my son, Draco, as he attempts to fulfill the Dark Lord's wishes?' 'I will,' said Snape. A thin tongue of brilliant flame issued from the wand and wound its way around their hands like a red-hot wire. 'And will you, to the best of your ability, to the best of your ability, protect him from harm?' 'I will,' said Snape. A second tongue of flame shot from the wand and interlinked with the first, making a fine, glowing chain. 'And, should it prove necessary... if it seems Draco will fail...' whispered Narcissa (Snape's hand twitched within hers, but he did not draw away), 'will you carry out the deed that the Dark Lord has ordered Draco to perform?' There was a moment's silence. Bellatrix watched, her wand upon their clasped hands, her eyes wide. 'I will,' said Snape. Bellatrix's astounded face glowed red in the blaze of a third tongue of flame, which shot from the wand, twisted with the others, and bound itself thickly around their clasped hands, like a rope, like a fiery snake.\" -\"'Judging by your look of stunned disbelief, Harry did not warn you that I was coming,' said Dumbledore pleasantly. 'However, let us assume that you have invited me warmly into your house.'\" -\"'I would assume that you were going to offer me refreshment,' Dumbledore said to Uncle Vernon, 'but the evidence so far suggests that that would be optimistic to the point of foolishness.'\" -\"The Dursleys, after quick, scared looks at one another, tried to ignore their glasses completely, a difficult feat, as they were nudging them gently on the sides of their heads. Harry could not suppress a suspicion that Dumbledore was rather enjoying himself.\" -\"'You are the rightful owner of number twelve, Grimmauld Place and of Kreacher.' 'Do I - do I have to keep him with me?' Harry asked, aghast as Kreacher thrashed around at his feet. 'Not if you don't want to,' said Dumbledore. 'If I might make a suggestion, you could send him to Hogwarts to work in the kitchen there. In that way, the other house-elves could keep an eye on him.'\" -\"'Hagrid will be delighted,' said Dumbledore, smiling. 'He was thrilled to see Buckbeak again. Incidentally, we have decided, in the interests of Buckbeak's safety, to rechristen him 'Witherwings' for the time being, though I doubt that the Ministry would ever guess he is the hippogriff they once sentenced to death.\" -\"'You have not asked me, for instance, what is my favorite flavor of jam, to check that I am indeed Professor Dumbledore and not an impostor.' 'I didn't...' Harry began, not entirely sure whether he was being reprimanded or not. 'For future reference, Harry, it is raspberry... although of course, if I were a Death Eater, I would have been sure to research my own jam preferences before impersonating myself.'\" -\"And without warning, Dumbledore swooped, plunging the tip of his wand into the seat of the overstuffed armchair, which yelled, 'Ouch!' 'Good evening, Horace,' said Dumbledore, straightening up again. Harry's jaw dropped. Where a split second before there had been an armchair, there now crouched an enormously fat, bald, old man who was massaging his lower belly...\" -\"...he was a big pal of your father's at school. The whole Black family had been in my House, but Sirius ended up in Gryffindor! Shame - he was a talented boy. I got his brother, Regulus, when he came along, but I'd have liked the set.\" -\"All ex-students, all signed. You'll notice Barnabas Cuffe, editor of the Daily Prophet, he's always interested to hear my take on there day's news. And Ambrosius Flume, of Honeydukes - a hamper every birthday, and all because I was able to give him an introduction to Ciceron Harkiss, who gave him his first job! And at the back - you'll see her if you just crane your neck - that's Gwenog Jones, who of course captains the Holyhead Harpies... People are always astonished to hear I'm on first-name terms with the Harpies, and free tickets whenever I want them!\" -\"I hope you will forgive me for mentioning it, Harry, but I am pleased and a little proud at how well you seem to be coping after everything that happened at the Ministry. Permit me to say that I think Sirius would have been proud of you.\" -\"'It was cruel,' said Dumbledore softly, 'that you and Sirius had such a short time together. A brutal ending to what should have been a long and happy relationship.'\" -\"'It's just hard,' Harry said finally, in a low voice, 'to realize he won't write to me again.'\" -\"'...I reazlied I can't shut myself away or - or crack up. Siris wouldn't have wanted that, would he? And anyway, life's too short... Look at Madam Bones, look at Emmeline Vance... It could be me next, couldn't it? But if it is,' he said fiercely, now looking straight into Dumbledore's blue eyes gleaming in the wandlight, 'I'll make sure I take as many Death Eaters with me as I can, and Voldemort too if I can manage it.' 'Spoken both like your mother and father's son and Sirius's true godson!'\" -\"Don't count your owls before they are delivered...\" -\"'Arthur, is that you?' 'Yes,' came Mr. Weasley's weary voice. 'But I would say that even if I were a Death Eater, dear. Ask the question!' 'Oh, honestly...' 'Molly!' 'All right, all right... What is your dearest ambition?' 'To find out how airplanes stay up.'\" -\"'What do you like me to call you when we're alone together?' Even by the dim light of the lantern Harry could tell that Mrs. Weasley had turned bright red; he himself felt suddenly warm around the ears and neck, and hastily gulped soup, clattering his spoon as loudly as he could against the bowl. 'Mollywobbles,' whispered a mortified Mrs. Weasley into the crack at the edge of the door. 'Correct,' said Mr. Weasley. 'Now you can let me in.'\" -\"A young woman was standing in the doorway, a woman of such breathtaking beauty that the room seemed to have become strangely airless. She was tall and willowy with long blonde hair and appeared to emanate a faint, silvery glow. To complete this vision of perfection, she was carrying a heavily laden breakfast tray.\" -\"'You remember my seester, Gabrielle? She never stops talking about 'Arry Potter. She will be delighted to see you again.' 'Oh... is she here too?' Harry croaked. 'No, no, silly boy,' said Fleur with a tinkling laugh, 'I mean next summer, when we - but do you not know?' Her great blue eyes widened and she looked reproachfully at Mrs. Weasley, who said, 'We hadn't got around to telling him yet.' Fleur turned back to Harry, swinging her silvery sheet of hair so that it whipped Mrs. Weasley across the face. 'Bill and I are going to be married!'\" -\"Dumbledore says people find it far easier to forgive others for being wrong than being right...\" -\"Then there was a loud bang and Hermione vanished behind a puff of black smoke. 'Hermione!' shouted Harry and Ron; the breakfast tray slid to the floor with a crash. Hermione emerged, coughing, out of the smoke, clutching the telescope and sporting a brilliantly purplle black eye. 'I squeezed it and it - it punched me!' she gasped. And sure enough, they now saw a tiny fist on a long spring protruding from the end of the telescope.\" -\"He spent most of his days playing two-a-side Quidditch in the Weasleys' orchard (he and Hermione against Ron and Ginny; Hermione was dreadful and Ginny good, so they were reasonably well matched) and his evenings eating triple helpings of everything Mrs. Weasley put in front of him.\" -\"And they've found Igor Karkaroff's body in a shack up north. The Dark Mark had been set over it - well, frankly, I'm surprised he stayed alive for even a year after the Death Eaters; Sirius's brother, Regulus, only managed a few days as far as I can remember.\" -\"'Did you hear about Florean Fortescue, Remus?' asked Bill, who was being plied with wine by Fleur. 'The man who ran-' '-the ice cream place in Diagon Alley?' Harry interrupted, with an unpleasant, hollow sensation in the pit of his stomach. 'He used to give me free ice creams. What's happened to him?' 'Dragged off, by the look of his place.'\" -\"WHY ARE YOU WORRYING ABOUT YOU-KNOW-WHO? YOU SHOULD BE WORRYING ABOUT U-NO-POO - THE CONSTIPATION SENSATION THAT'S GRIPPING THE NATION!\" -\"There were bins full of trick wands, the cheapest merely turning into rubber chickens or pairs of briefs when waved, the most expensive beating the unwary user around the head and neck, and boxes of quills, which came in Self-Inking, Spell-Checking, and Smart-Answer varieties.\" -\"'Patented Daydream Charms...' Hermione had managed to squeeze through to a large display near the counter and was reading the information on the back of a box bearing a highly colored picture of a handsome youth and a swooning girl who were standing on the deck of a pirate ship. 'One simple incantation and you will enter a top-quality, highly realistic, thirty-minute daydream, easy to fit into the average school lesson and virtually undetectable (side effects include vacant expression and minor drooling). Not for sale to under-sixteens. You know,' said Hermione, looking up at Harry, 'that really is extraordinary magic!' 'For that Hermione,' said a voice behind them, 'you can have one for free.' A beaming Fred stood before them, wearing a set of magenta robes that clashed magnificently with his flaming hair.\" -\"'And our Decoy Detonators are just walking off the shelves, look,' said Fred, pointing at a number of weird-looking black horn-type objects that were indeed attempting to scurry out of sight. 'You just drop one surreptitiously and it'll run off and make a nice loud noise out of sight, giving you a diversion if you need one.'\" -\"She was pointing at a number of round balls of fluff in shades of pink and purple, all rolling around the bottom of a cage and emitting high-pitched squeaks. 'Pigmy Puffs,' said George. 'Miniature puff skeins, we can't breed them fast enough.' -\"'That's three Galleons, nine Sickles, and a Knut,' said Fred, examining the many boxes in Ron's arms. 'Cough up.' 'I'm your brother!' 'And that's our stuff you're nicking. Three Galleons, nine Sickles. I'll knock off the Knut.'\" -\"...Bill and I 'ave almost decided on only two bridesmaids, Ginny and Gabrielle will look very sweet togezzer.\" -\"...their departure the following morning was smoother than usual. The Ministry cars glided up to the front of the Burrow to find them waiting, trunks packed; Hermione's cat, Crookshanks. safely enclosed in his traveling basket; and Hedwig; Ron's owl, Pigwidgeon; and Ginny's new purple Pygmy Puff, Arnold, in cages. 'Au revoir, 'Arry,' said Fleur throatily, kissing him good-bye. Ron hurried forward, looking hopeful, but Ginny stuck out her foot and Ron fell, sprawling in the dust at Fleur's feet.\" -\"...indicating Neville's bottom, which was sticking out from under the seat again as he groped around for Trevor, and Luna, who was now wearing her free Spectrespecs, which gave her the look of a demented, multicolored owl. 'They're friends of mine,' said Harry coldly.\" -\"Zabini, who was interrogated after McLaggen, turned out to have a famously beautiful witch for a mother (from what Harry could make out, she had been married seven times, each of her husbands dying mysteriously and leaving her mounds of gold).\" -\"You want to be careful, Blaise! I saw this young lady perform the most marvelous Bat-Bogey Hex as I was passing her carriage! I wouldn't cross her!\" -\"'He saw me hex Zacharias Smith,' said Ginny. 'You remember that idiot from Hufflepuff who was in the D.A.? He kept on and on asking about what happened at the Ministry and in the end he annoyed me so much I hexed him...'\" -\"...she waved her wand; an immense silvery four-legged creature erupted from it and streaked off into the darkness. 'Was that a Patronus?' asked Harry, who had seen Dumbledore send messages like this.\" -\"'I would rather die than betray his trust.' 'That's not saying much, seeing as you're already dead,' Ron observed. 'Once again, you show all the sensitivity of a blunt axe,' said Nearly Headless Nick...\" -\"'My grandmother thinks Charms is a soft option,' mumbled Neville. 'Take Charms,' said Professor McGonagall, 'and I shall drop Augusta a line reminding her that just because she failed her Charms O.W.L., the subject is not necessarily worthless.'\" -\"'Yes,' said Harry stiffly. 'Yes, sir.' 'There's no need to call me 'sir,' Professor.'\" -\"Dear Harry, I would like to start our private lessons this Saturday. Kindly come along to my office at 8 P.M. I hope you are enjoying your first day back at school. Yours sincerely, Albus Dumbledore P.S. I enjoy Acid Pops.\" -\"They chose the one nearest a gold-colored cauldron that was emitting one of the most seductive scents Harry had ever inhaled: Somehow it reminded him simultaneously of treacle tart, the woody smell of a broomstick handle, and something flowery he thought he might have found at the Burrow.\" -\"Good lord, it's clear you've inherited your mother's talent. She was a dab hand at Potions, Lily was! Here you are, then, here you are - one bottle of Felix Felicis, as promised, and use it well!\" -\"...he caught a sudden waft of that flowery smell he had picked up in Slughorn's dungeon. He looked around and saw that Ginny had joined them.\" -\" Hissy, hissy, little snake, Slither on the floor, You be good to Morfin, Or he'll nail you to the door. \" -\"Any Dark object would have been found, I know for a fact Crabbe had a shrunken head confiscated.\" -\"...Harry watched Ginny Weasley playing with Arnold the Pigmy Puff for a while...\" -\"Harry had already attempted a few of the Prince's self-invented spells. There had been a hex that caused toenails to grow alarmingly fast (he had tried this on Crabbe in the corridor, with very entertaining results); a jinx that glued the tongue to the roof of the mouth (which he had twice used, to general applause, on an unsuspecting Argus Filch); and, perhaps most useful of all, Muffliato, a spell that filled the ears of anyone nearby with an unidentifiable buzzing, so that lengthy conversations could be held in class without being overheard.\" -\"POinting his wand at nothing in particular, he gave it an upward flick and said Levicorpus! inside his head. 'Aaaaaaaargh!' There was a flash of light and the room was full of voices: Everyone had woken up as Ron had let out a yell. Harry sent Advanced Potion-Making flying in panic; Ron was dangling upside down in midair as though an invisible hook had hoisted him up by the ankle.\" -\"'There is no way they'd let me be a Death Eater!' said Ron indignantly, a bit of sausage flying off the fork he was now brandishing at Hermione and hitting Ernie Macmillan on the head.\" -\"There is a fund at Hogwarts for those who require assistance to buy books and robes.\" -\"Amidst all the yelling and clapping Harry could distinctly hear the roar of Luna Lovegood's famous lion-topped hat.\" -\"A tall, skinny blond boy with an upturned nose was standing there, talking into the magical megaphone that had once been Lee Jordan's; Harry recognized Zacharias Smith, a Hufflepuff player whom he heartily disliked.\" -\"...Ginny sped right on past them until, with an almighty crash, she collided with the commentator's podium. As the crowd shrieked and laughed, the Gryffindor team landed beside the wreckage of wood under which Zacharias was feebly stirring; Harry heard saying blithely to an irate Professor McGonagall, 'Forgot to brake, Professor, sorry.'\" -\"As he was ducking toward the drinks table, he walked straight into Ginny, Arnold the Pygmy Puff riding on her shoulder and Crookshanks mewing hopefully at her heels.\" -\"She was sitting on the teacher's desk, alone except for a small right of twittering yellow birds circling her head, which she had clearly just conjured out of midair.\" -\" 'Oppugno!' came shriek from the doorway. Harry spun around to see Hermione pointing her wand at Ron, her expression wild; The little flock of birds was speeding like a hail of fat golden bullets toward Ron, who yelped and covered his face with his hands, but the birds attacked, pecking and clawing at every bit of flesh they could reach.\" -\"'Or d'you think she overheard you being rude about Filch? I've always thought there might be something going on between them...' 'Oh, ha ha...' Enjoying the fact that they could speak normally again, they made their way along the deserted, lamp-lit corridors back to the common room, arguing about whether or not Filch and Madam Pince were secretly in love with each other.\" -\"They had just embarked upon the immensely difficult topic of human Transfiguration; working in front of mirrors, they were supposed to be changing the color of their own eyebrows. Hermione laughed unkindly at Ron's disastrous first attempt, during which he somehow managed to give himself a spectacular handlebar mustache...\" -\"'A bit lonely without the D.A. Ginny's been nice, though. She stopped two boys in our Transfiguration class calling me 'Loony' the other day-'\" -And many more that I can't fit here!"

        "text":"Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince .   There were some things I truly loved about this one. I loved how the bulk of the book, nothing crazy happened. It felt like some of the older books and I love that feeling. All the Harry and Dumbledore time we got, the memories of Voldemort’s past (which were very interesting) and of course Harry and Ginny, who I’ve shipped for a while now finally got their shot. That’s the good. There is also a lot of sadness and despair. A very important and influential character dies. Sides are chosen. People you trust turn out to be not who they say they are (or so we think…) The last 2 hours of this 18 hour audio book broke my heart. I almost want to wait a while to do the final book, but I really want to finish these books by the end of 2016 so I better start it straight away. Wish me luck! I know I’ll need it xoxo"

(2) Fudge: \"Is a man alive if he can't be killed? I don't really understand it, and Dumbledore won't explain properly.\" - Well, horcruxes are forbidden knowledge. 06\/25\/2020 - 6% (1) \"A threadbare sofa, an old armchair, and a rickety table stood grouped together in a pool of dim light cast by a candle-filled lamp.\" - How vampire-chic. - Snape's house could use a woman's touch. (2) \"In her fury [Bellatrix] looked slightly mad.\" - I guess she's always in her \"fury\" then. (3) I never hear of wizard divorces... perhaps they make unbreakable vows? 06\/26\/2020 - 9% (1) \"Rufus Scrimgeour ... has succeeded Cornelius Fudge as Minister of Magic. The appointment has largely been greeted with enthusiasm.\" - Appointment? By who? There doesn't appear to be any wizarding monarch or anything. (2) J.K. Rowling does love giving animal descriptions to antagonists: Scrimgeour is \"lionlike,\" Petunia has a \"horsey face,\" Vernon has \"piggy eyes,\" etc. 06\/27\/2020 - 13% (1) We're introduced to the idea of inferi, which are essentially zombies. The lack of a full-blown zombie chase is one of the series' big missed opportunities. (2) \"The wandlight sparkled on [Slughorn's] shiny pate, his prominent eyes, his enormous, silver, walruslike mustache ...\" - Again with the animal descriptors. (3) Gwenog Jones must be the Welshest name ever. 06\/28\/2020 - 17% Harry and Ginny be like, \"I shouldn't have been so happy about that hug.\" (1) Two weeks since last book and Hermione's already at the Burrow when Harry arrives? Poor Hermione's parents. (2) \"Hermione flashed a warning look at Ron, and Ron changed tack at top speed.\" - Already giving each other married couple signals. (3) Hermione: \"I know I failed everything!\" 06\/29\/2020 - 20% (1) Fred to Ginny: \"Moving through boyfriends a bit fast, aren't you?\" - Well, one per year's not so fast. Though, compared to the other Weasleys, I suppose. (2) '\"Our Decoy Detonators are just walking off the shelves, look,\" said Fred, pointing at a number of weird-looking black hooter-type objects.' - I presume \"hooter\" means something different in British English. 06\/30\/2020 - 23% (1) '\"She has let 'erself go, zat Tonks,\" Fleur mused.' - Sounds like Fleur's finally cottoned onto Molly and Ginny's cunning plan to get Bill to dump her for Tonks. (2) In the books, Luna's Spectrespecs are a kind of snake oil novelty. In the film they actually work! Film Luna is treated as more of an eccentric than the books, where she's sort of a lovable gullible. 07\/01\/2020 - 26% Ginny be like: \"Get a room you two.\" (1) It's a mark of Ron and Hermione's closeness that she's comfortable enough to hit him repeatedly with a book, and he's comfortable enough to let her. (2) Nearly Headless Nick: \"I would rather die than betray [Harry's] trust.\" Ron: \"That's not saying much, seeing as you're already dead.\" - Ron again with the common sense. 07\/02\/2020 - 29% Finally! Book-accurate bushy hair! (1) Snape: \"We are practicing nonverbal spells, Potter.\" Harry: \"Yes.\" Snape: \"Yes, sir.\" Harry: \"There's no need to call me 'sir,' Professor.\" - New levels of reckless sass. (2) Harry smells something flowery in the love potion. Just 10 pages later, Harry smells something flowery and turns to see Ginny. - Not exactly subtle. 07\/03\/2020 - 33% (1) The House of Gaunt has a very Craster's Keep vibe to it. (2) Merope seems right out of a Jane Austen novel. (3) Dumbledore: \"The Gaunts [were] noted for a vein of instability and violence that flourished through the generations due to their habit of marrying their own cousins.\" - Not so different than European royals, then... and a fair bit better than Egyptians. 07\/04\/2020 - 36% (1) Ron gets attention from Lavender, Hermione gives him the cold shoulder. Hermione congratulates Ron, Lavender walks off grumpy. Meanwhile, Ron's totally oblivious. (2) Harry: \"But wasn't that dishonest, Hermione? I mean, you're a prefect, aren't you?\" - Hermione gets a taste of her own medicine here, seeing as she says this to Ron all the time, albeit less polite. 07\/05\/2020 - 39% Callback\/Mirroring: You've got something on your face. (1) Harry: \"The Prince had proved a much more effective teacher than Snape so far.\" - Oh the irony. (2) Hermione: \"Ron, what are you staring at?\" Ron: \"Nothing.\" Hermione: \"I expect 'nothing's' in the back getting more firewhisky.\" - Ron crushing on Madam Rosmerta and Hermione being jealous never gets old. 07\/06\/2020 - 42% (1) Wonder if Caractacus Burke was named after the Briton chieftain or the dad from Chitty-Chitty-Bang-Bang? (2) Orphanage matron: \"He was to be named Tom, for his father, and Marvolo, for her father — yes, I know, funny name, isn't it? We wondered whether she came from a circus.\" - Hmm... The Great Marvolo! (3) Young Voldemort owning a harmonica is just plain funny. 07\/07\/2020 - 44% (1) Harry: \"What if Ron and Hermione started going out together, then split up? Could their friendship survive it?\" - Depends how much they enjoy bickering... it's kind of their thing. (2) \"What if they didn't split up? What if ... it became excruciatingly embarrassing to be in their presence, so that he was shut out for good?\" - Classic third-wheel talk right there. 07\/08\/2020 - 46% (1) Harry: \"Ginny, don't call Ron a prat, you're not the Captain of this team.\" Ginny: \"Well, you seemed too busy to call him a prat.\" - Can't fault the logic. (2) Ginny teases Ron for \"never snogg[ing] anyone in his life.\" She also tells Ron \"Hermione snogged Viktor Krum.\" Enraged and shamed, Ron snogs stalkerish Lavender Brown. Ergo, Ginny's to blame for that mess. 07\/09\/2020 - 48% Ron makes Hermione cry on stairs a lot. (1) Ron: \"She can't complain ... She snogged Krum. So she's found out someone wants to snog me too ... I haven't done anything wrong.\" - Ron's not wrong, but misses the point. (2) Hermione: \"He's at perfect liberty to kiss whomever he likes ... I really couldn't care less.\" - She sure talks about it a lot for not caring. 07\/10\/2020 - 49% (1) '\"Are you going out with [Cormac], then?\" asked Parvati, wide-eyed. \"Oh — yes — didn't you know?\" said Hermione, with a most un-Hermione-ish giggle.' - I doubt there's even a Hermione-ish giggle. Mostly she blushes. (2) Harry: \"Serves you right for coming with [Cormac].\" Hermione: \"I thought he'd annoy Ron most.\" - I expect no less from a jealousy-fueled romance. 07\/11\/2020 - 51% (1) \"Harry ... was still trying not to think about Ginny any more than he could help, despite the fact that she kept cropping up in his dreams in ways that made him devoutly thankful that Ron could not perform Legilimency.\" - Hopefully those dreams aren't Voldemort's doing. (2) \"Harry was left to ponder in silence the depths to which girls would sink to get revenge.\" 07\/12\/2020 - 53% Harry and Ginny be like: Not cool bro! (1) Kreacher gifts Harry a box of maggots. Not useful, but it's the thought that counts. (2) '\"Harry, you've got a maggot in your hair,' said Ginny cheerfully, leaning across the table to pick it out; Harry felt goose bumps erupt up his neck that had nothing to do with the maggot.' - Most romantic maggot scene in fiction? 07\/13\/2020 - 56% (1) \"Abstinence\" is the new common room password. Sneaky, having students recite it repeatedly. (2) Harry: \"Hermione, can't you [make up with Ron]?\" Hermione: \"No, I can't... So don't even ask.\" - Can't or won't? (3) \"The contents proved difficult to empty into the Pensieve, as though they had congealed slightly; did memories go bad?\" - Eh, only the regrettable ones. 07\/14\/2020 - 58% (1) Hermione: \"Oh, well, if Won-Won thinks that, you'd better do it ... After all, when has Won-Won's judgment ever been faulty?\" - It's contagious! Now Hermione's saying \"Won-Won.\" Sarcasm, yes, but \"Won-Won\" regardless. (2) \"Friends they might be, but if Ron started calling Lavender 'Lav-Lav,' [Harry] would have to put his foot down.\" - The buck stops at \"Lav-Lav\"! 07\/15\/2020 - 60% Poor Lavender :( (1) Hermione: \"Golpalott's Third Law states that the antidote for a blended poison will be equal to more than the sum of the antidotes for each of the separate components.\" - That makes no sense! How can something be equal to more than a sum? It would just be greater than it! (2) The gif never happens in the book, but it's my favorite scene :) 07\/16\/2020 - 62% (1) \"[Harry] was now being dogged wherever he went by Cormac McLaggen and Lavender Brown. He could not decide which of them was more annoying.\" - I vote Lavender. (2) \"Harry's imagination zoomed into overdrive ... Ginny, weeping over his lifeless form, confessed her feelings of deep attraction to him while Ron gave them his blessing.\" - Pretty passive ambition there. 07\/17\/2020 - 64% (1) Lavender: \"Is Hermione Granger still visiting [Ron]?\" Harry: \"Yeah, I think so. Well, they're friends, aren't they?\" Lavender: \"Friends, don't make me laugh ... She didn't talk to him for weeks after he started going out with me! But I suppose she wants to make up with him now he's all interesting.\" - Now we know what Lavender looks for in a partner. Interesting. 07\/18\/2020 - 68% (1) Lavender to Ron: \"Why didn't you tell me you were getting out today? And why was she with you?\" - I suppose a condition of being Lavender's boyfriend is having to cut loose all your female friends. (2) Voldemort: \"You are omniscient as ever, Dumbledore.\" Dumbledore: \"Oh no, merely friendly with the local barmen.\" - That's some stealthy foreshadowing there. 07\/19\/2020 - 71% (1) Ron: \"I love you, Hermione.\" Hermione: \"Don't let Lavender hear you saying that.\" Ron: \"I won't ... Or maybe I will ... then she'll ditch me.\" - Essentially, that's what happened in the film. (2) The Imperius Curse = Temporary insanity defense. (3) Harry supposes Tonks was in love with Sirius, which no one thinks is weird. Wizard views on incest are oddly casual. 07\/20\/2020 - 73% (1) Ron: \"Quick, hide me!\" Hermione: \"It isn't Lavender!\" - If it were Lavender, I think hiding behind Hermione would make things much worse. (2) Harry hesitates to use his vial of Felix Felicis, having saved it to break up Ginny and Dean. Luckily, that happened as a side effect of his Slughorn mission. So, bonus points. - Incidentally, Harry's low-key a homewrecker. 07\/21\/2020 - 75% (1) '\"What were you doing up there with her?\" shrieked Lavender Brown, staring right through Harry at Ron and Hermione emerging together from the boys' dormitories.' - Lavender's suspicions confirmed! - Lucky all around... except Lavender. (2) Slughorn: \"Had a house-elf taste every bottle after what happened to your poor friend Rupert.\" - I see what she did there :) 07\/22\/2020 - 78% (1) '\"You have [uncommon skill and power],\" said Dumbledore firmly. \"You have a power that Voldemort has never had. You can —\" \"I know!\" said Harry impatiently. \"I can love!\" It was only with difficulty that he stopped himself adding, \"Big deal!\".' - I had the same reaction as Harry to the ending of \"The Fifth Element.\" \"Really? Love is the greatest power there is?\" 07\/23\/2020 - 82% (1) Flitwick: \"A little less talk, a little more action.\" - Wasn't that an Elvis song? No, wait, that was \"A Little Less Conversation.\" (2) Harry's mind: \"She's Ron's sister. But she's ditched Dean! She's still Ron's sister. I'm his best mate! That'll make it worse. If I talked to him first — He'd hit you. What if I don't care? He's your best mate!\" - Ron, Ron, Ron. 07\/24\/2020 - 85% (1) Ginny: \"All Romilda Vane does is ask me if it's true you've got a hippogriff tattooed across your chest ... I told her it's a Hungarian Horntail ... Much more macho.\" - Harry's already kinda got a lightning bolt tattoo, and on his face too! I'd guess that's be even more macho. (2) \"Rage and resentment fought shock and excitement.\" - Fight it! Angst was so Book 5. 07\/25\/2020 - 86% (1) Perhaps Harry's grown too used to magic. He's fine charging headlong into danger, but a short swim in cold water totally freaks him out. Who is he? Film-Ron? (2) \"Harry had long since learned that bangs and smoke were more often the marks of ineptitude than expertise.\" - I wonder if he's referring to Seamus, who's gimmick is he often accidentally blows things up? 07\/26\/2020 - 87% (1) How is Harry shocked that blood magic is a thing? Voldemort was revived by his blood! (2) Dumbldore: \"You are underage and unqualified. Voldemort would never have expected a sixteen-year-old to reach this place: I think it unlikely that your powers will register compared to mine.\" - So... Harry should be glad the alarm can't detect his negligible amount of magic. 07\/27\/2020 - 88% (1) Harry needs blood to open the archway. Luckily, he was already cut whilst fighting Inferi. Even zombies have a silver lining. (2) '\"It's going to be all right, sir,\" Harry said over and over again ... \"Don't worry...\" \"I am not worried, Harry,\" said Dumbledore, his voice a little stronger despite the freezing water. \"I am with you.\"' - Hits me right in the feels. *character limit Click here for the rest [\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>"

They may have been put under the Imperius Curse.\" Time for interesting little subplots is over. We've arrived finally, where everything is closely tied to the core of the story and progressing fast. It's always delightful to see, everything that was great about the series still remains the same, if not better. However, disappointments, sorrow and hardships are what the reader is going to encounter for the most part. As I finished reading Half-Blood Prince, more than ever before, I feel being trapped in a hopeless situation filled with nothing but forebodings. \"Destination...determination...deliberation...\" One would imagine, we're beyond being accommodated with new characters, but the author will quickly convince you otherwise, and introduction of new and interesting characters continues. It's great to see how Rowling keeps outperforming herself with each new book . Harry's ill-tempered nature and suspicions does not end with the last book as I hoped it would, but the results are quite the opposite this time around. Honestly, I did not anticipate the way how things turned out right till the last three chapters. \"To friendship! To generosity! To ten Galleons a hair! We've been somewhat used to happy ending in the first four books (relatively) with 5th being a bit disappointing but this one, it was the most depressing ending for me yet. It probably comes down to reinforcing the suspense toward the final book but, it's a difficult place to be in - especially if you had to wait for a year.. \"Eet 'as been too long!\""

The Half-Blood prince was considerably darker than the previous 5 books, and I just adore how this series has progressed and grown just like most of its readers have. Obviously I knew what the big reveal was prior to finishing the book due to my viewing the films before, but it didn't take away from the experience the novel had to offer. I have this nervous lump in my throat knowing that the next book is the final one, but am simultaneously excited to finally read what the films surely have left out surrounding the conclusion of the series."

Severus, who sacrificed his own soul. Severus, who loved another more than life itself. Severus, the half-blood prince- the truth about his character was, and will likely always be, one of the most surprising twists I’ve ever read in fiction. The set up is all in this book."

        "text":"I was first introduced to Harry Potter in a Children’s Lit class in college. I had resisted this popular phenomenon until I was forced to pick it up for a grade, and Book 1 was short enough that I could read it in the course of 2 hours. I have to admit I wasn’t impressed to any extent, nor did I dislike the experience, but I was critical on grounds of its being derivative, even if reading the first led to reading the second. After all, if I was bored and looking for something light, I could do worse than a fantasy about a child wizard who fights evil with his friends. But it was really the third book, with its increasing darkness, that took me in and made me a fan. With a movie coming out for Order of Phoenix and Deathly Hallows on the horizon, I decided I would reread Half-Blood Prince. I figured it would take four sittings, of course, with its 600 pages, but time does fly when reading this one, and I’ve come to the conclusion that this is my favorite so far. What I wouldn’t have been willing to admit in college that I’m perfectly comfortable saying now is that J.K. Rowling is a fantastic storyteller; she writes with great clarity, wit, and humor; and she’s created a cast of loveable characters with whom most people, due to the common experience of growing up, can relate closely. That said, the reason for my preference for the 6th book is that it’s the most emotionally rich in the series. Here we get the backstory of Voldemort (*spoiler alert*) through a series of flashbacks (coming in HP by way of magically extracted memories), and in this way, we come to understand the villain’s similarities and differences with our hero. After all, the villain has to have reasons for committing heinous acts, and until now, we don’t know what these are. Voldemort is from a once-powerful wizard family reduced to poverty that lives in a dilapidated hovel on the edge of a small town, wary of outsiders, and their main point of pride is their pure blood, the lineage having cross-bred for generations so as not to pollute the line. Voldemort’s mother lives with her father and brother and yearns for the love of a nonmagical man (“muggle” in this world) and when her father and brother are arrested, she uses the opportunity to bewitch her beloved and run off. She ends up pregnant, the man deserts her, and she dies while giving birth to her half-wizard, half-muggle son, thus making him an orphan (like Harry). (Faulkner anyone?) But whereas Harry comes to Hogwarts and befriends Ron and Hermione creating unity and strength through positive emotions, Voldemort, when growing in the orphanage shuns other children, torturing them at times (without the awareness of adults) and stealing their possessions. What fuels him is his hatred of his beginnings, his mother’s weakness at having died like a common person despite being a witch, and the “muggle” blood inherited from his father. Over the course of his time at Hogwarts, Voldemort, charming as only evil can be, learns to win over people as a means to an end and disguise his insidious purposes, but he never befriends anyone. He moves, through his hatred, further away from many of the emotions that drive Harry, namely the desire to protect the people he loves and avenge his parents’ death. With Dumbledore’s help in exploring Voldemort’s past, Harry begins to understand that he’s come to be where he is through the choices he’s made, that his greatest strengths are an alliance with his friends, and that this might hold the key to destroying his enemy, a fact that’s made all the more poignant when Dumbledore, in an all-out assault on Hogwarts by Voldemort’s Death Eaters, is killed at the end. The stakes are higher than before, the action and pace increase as the conclusion draws near, and things are looking darker than ever, which is the setup that any fan wants when the end is looming and it leaves us with the question: How will our hero prevail?"

        "text":"Reminder that all of my Harry Potter reviews contain unmarked spoilers, and lots of ’em. If you’re one of the two people on Goodreads who hasn’t read this series, this review is not for you. So, my dear underside-of-a-rock-residing friends: https:\/\/emmareadstoomuch.wordpress.co... This review will be interesting, because this book was far (far, far) from perfect, and yet I am utterly determined to give it 5 stars. (Which I have only given to the first book in this series.) God, how do you talk about this book? It’s really amazing. It is really hard for me to feel anything while reading a book or generally living my life . For example, I felt nothing when Sirius died. Nothing throughout most of this series, actually. And nothing in this book, because nothing happened and everyone survived and everything is sunshiney and joyful! Ugh. I tried. The last hundred-ish pages of this book really tore me apart. Okay, even that’s not true. I’ll just come out and say it: I’m really f*cking sad that Dumbledore died. I love him so much. He’s high up in my top 5 characters. (Do I even have a top 5?) I’m devastated, which makes me even more upset, because I have a life to live today and can’t just lay around and wallow in fictional pain. I’m going to move on in the hopes that I just. Forget. Because I don’t like this at ALL. Here, we see Harry Potter - who, I think few will argue, has been a fairly mediocre character up to this point - become AMAZING. He’s motivated solely by his need to work against injustice and evil. He realizes his parents’ legacy within himself. He denounces the sucking up of others. He works hard in school! He is a good friend even when his two BFFS are being childish to one another plus refusing to believe him. In short, he’s really, really, five-star-level great here. Gorgeous character development in 650 pages. I didn’t think I liked Ginny much, because I didn’t remember this book well...like, at all. But she is so great! So funny. I wish there was more of her in this book. Also, I’ll fight anyone who says Dumbledore is ~the real villain~ of this series. He’s really not. (Cough, Snape is, cough.) AND YOU'RE NOT EDGY, PEOPLE WHO HATE DUMBLEDORE BUT LOVE SNAPE. YOU'RE JUST DUMB. I fell deeply in love with the guy. (Dumbledore, not Snape. BLEH.) AND I F*CKING MISS HIM. Goddamn it. Trying to forget didn’t last very long. Anyway. I missed Hermione and Neville. Hermione was absolutely not well-represented here at all. Maybe it’s a good thing she’s not a Ravenclaw (#RavenclawPride) because she works fully against logic throughout this book. And when she’s not she just, like, refuses to believe Harry. Ron is soooooooooo annoying! Is he anyone’s favorite character? He’s like, Fred or George if one of them was totally childish and attention-starved and mean. In fact, Ronald is a pretty impressive character for the number of gross character traits he embodies despite being supposed to be a good character. Mean, immature, rude, jealous, definition of an inferiority complex. Bleh. Harry and Ginny I’m totally for, BUT THE OTHER RELATIONSHIPS IN THIS BOOK ARE SO BORING. Can we do Hermione and Fred instead? Ron and Luna would be cute. Or, God forbid, some LGBT representation? WE KNOW YOU’RE A SUPPORTER, JOANNE. Don’t even get me started on Lupin and Tonks. Speaking of supposedly-good characters’ downfalls: I’m no longer a Hagrid fan. It started with the last book and came fully around here. Like, at a certain point, the man needs a character trait. Liking weird animals, making bad food, and being humongous don’t count. Harry and Hermione’s constant stubbornness is annoying. Plus makes the plot repetitive once in a while. Also, Tonks. You know what, I guess I AM going to get started on Lupin and Tonks! She was a hilarious badass in the last book, totally depressed and weak in this one. I know I sound like a total emotionless asshole here, but that’s who I am, and she’s annoying in this book. AND IT’S TOTALLY FINE BECAUSE SHE’S JUST BEING A SPINELESS IDIOT OVER SOME DUMB SHABBY MAN. Kill me, please. Then I can see my beloved Dumbledore again. Too much Snape. (Cannot WAIT to write the rant on him.) Too much Draco. (Why do people romanticize that little weirdo so much? I guess I get the temptation, but he’s a bully at best and a spineless traitor at worst.) I hate Kreacher and I hate Dobby...I hated Winky, too...I might hate house elves. If that makes me racist against a species of fictional character, SO BE IT, I GUESS. I miss Fred and George, and the fun people from the Order (if they existed), and Hermione and Neville aren’t here nearly enough. The price of Harry’s amazing and concise character development is WAY too many bad characters, not nearly enough of the good ones. EXCEPT DUMBLEDORE. UGHHHH. I’M SO SAD. (I think my inability to cry is making this worse. Maybe if I just creepily sobbed in front of my roommate for a few minutes I’d feel better. Damn you, my lack of emotions! Just kidding love you.) But I want to give this book five stars more than anything. It was so compulsively readable, more than any other book since the first for me. And it’s the last book where our pals are attending Hogwarts. That makes me so sad. It’s such a gorgeous setting and I’m going to miss it so much. WHY IS THIS BOOK SO SAD?! If Deathly Hallows is any sadder I’ll be seriously impressed. And also seriously screwed. And, okay, even though I was a harsh critic of these books...I’m really going to miss this series. I’ve been rereading it on and off (obviously) for three months, and it’s been a fun ride. This is one of the greatest settings of all time. And since I’m rereading it after 10 years, it’s like saying goodbye twice. AND I HATE ENDINGS. Bottom line: Okay, THIS is my favorite Harry Potter book. (Anyone else’s?) Unreal character development + tragic and lovely adieu to a gorgeous setting + ability to make me feel real, deep emotion + compulsively readable? An absolute dream. ----------ORIGINAL REVIEW--------------- Ron and Hermione's will-they-won't-they is a total snoozefest. I propose Fred & Hermione and Ron & Luna instead. Also seven more books!"

        "text":"For a long time this book had a special place in my freezer with my favorite ice creams and frozen food I was banned to cook (I eventually burn them when I defreeze them. I was born with non-culinary skills!) I repeated what Joey Tribbianni did because after finishing this book I cried so hard, I cursed nonstop, I screamed till my local cords declare their uselessness and I tried to throw the hardcopy out of the window but I changed my mind because an innocent kid may have found the book at the outside and started to read and cry nonstop! So instead of throwing away or burning the pages( which is so harsh punishment because this book is still a classic and it’s one of the best ones of the series)freezing the book and never forgiving the author for killing one of my favorite characters were the best choices I’ve had. As my new weekend quarantine habit: I started retro weekend tradition and reread my favorite series. Even though this book broke my heart more than a decade before, at least this time I prepared myself with lots of tissues and golden toilet papers( they’re so precious things and I hang them on the walls with hand sanitizers as if they’re historical artifacts.) and I bottled up my happy memories inside my head to protect my heart tear apart. This is sweet 16 adventures of Harry: the girl crushes, secret smiles, hormonal and characteristic changes, seeing the world from different aspect! If I didn’t get so sad with the unexpected ending, this might be second favorite HP book because JKR- wizard of the words reflected the emotional and psychical changing as they grow up more and realize the biggest danger out there to steal their best times of their lives. I never get bored to reread any HP books or anything JKR writes. (instead of shopping list. Lately they made me sleep!) So I had quite great time with my nostalgic journey to the past and realize I will find myself reading these books a decade later and I will still get the great taste of literature and have quality time. That’s the magic of skilled writing and gifted talent!"

        "text":"Second Reread Review: REVIEW TO COME SOON ••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••• 5 GLOWING MAGICAL STARS! 'Dumbledore says people find it far easier to forgive others for being wrong than being right,' said Hermione. 'I heard him telling your mum, Ron.' I'm really enjoying this series so far but this series gets darker and darker. the first three of this series were so funny and cute even though there were sad scenes on them and the fourth, fifth and sixth books contained so much pain and I even shed more tears for these book than I did for the the first three. I have lost a favorite character that always made me laugh and smile. this character is Sirus Black. I even still can't get over his death. but let's admit it that maybe there's a death of character that we will never get over. *takes deep breath* okay let's talk about this book ・。・゜★・。・。☆・゜・。・゜。・。・゜★・。・。☆・。・゜★・。・。 PHLEGM I have never liked Fleur Delacour very much since I first saw her on the book four and then I saw her again on the book four as Bill's girlfriend or Fiancee and I also laughed when Ginny called Fleur Phlegm. I also still don't how Bill fell in love with her but yeah, she is pretty but I thought Bill deserved someone better than her. I like Bill so much. he is so cool with his red long hair. maybe I didn't like Phlegm because I was jealous hahahaha okay it is not maybe, I was jealous. but look at this scene : ''E is always so thoughtful,' purred Fleur adoringly, stroking Bill's nose. Ginny mimed vomiting into her cereal behind Fleur. Harry choked over his cornflakes and Ron thumped him on the back. ugh ... how could I like her if she acted like that?!? that was really annoying and Ginny also found it disgusting. Hermione and Ginny didn't even like her. but she changed my mind on the the end of this book because when Bill was attacked by ... that werewolf guy who bit Remus when he was a kid. Bill is no longer as handsome as he used to be but Fleur still loves him. she doesn't care about how he looks and I even thought she would leave him after he was attacked but she didn't and that time I changed my mind about her. She is the right girl for Bill, even though I am a little bit jealous hahaha xD Ron and Hermione I ship these two so much and I really really like Ron. Ron and Hermione are always funny. they always bicker about something and I think the first time Ron fell in love with Hermione was on the book four because he was so angry when he knew Hermione went to the Yule Ball with Viktor Krum and in this book Ron hurt me so much. He thought that Hermione kissed Krum and he was so angry and jealous because of this and he kissed Lavender in the common room that was full of people and it also broke Hermione's heart. Harry looked into the corner she was indicating. There, in full view of the whole room, stood Ron wrapped so closely around Lavender Brown it was hard to tell whose hands were whose. And I was so angry in that moment 'Er - my - nee,' croaked Ron unexpectedly from between them. but all my anger was gone when he was poisoned and he said that while he was asleep. I think he was trying to say Hermione, so that meant he dreamt about her and I forgave him that exact time and he also didn't really like Lavender anymore since then. he even pretended to be asleep when Lavender came to visit him in the hospital wing. so that meant he didn't like her anymore and I don't think he actually liked Lavender before he was poisoned. I think he just kissed Lavender because he wanted to make Hermione jealous and feel hurt, which he successfully did. Harry And Ginny have you ever thought why Ginny had relationship with quite many guys? wait ... not many guys because she just dated two boys, Dean and Michael. But she always got a boyfriend as soon as she split up with her ex and my thoughs about this is probably right because Ginny said this to Harry on the end of the book 'I never really gave up on you,' she said. 'Not really. I always hoped ... Hermione told me to get on with life, maybe go out with some other people, relax a bit around you, because I never used to be able to talk if you were in the room, remember? And she thought you might take a bit more notice if I was a bit more - myself.' I think Ginny always dated a guy as soon as she split up with her ex because she always tried to forget Harry, so maybe if she had a boyfriend, she wouldn't love Harry anymore. But according to what she said she never really gave up on Harry so that means she has always loved him. I was a bit sad when Harry said they can't be together again because Harry was afraid if something would happen to Ginny if they kept seeing each other. he was afraid if Voldemort used Ginny to get him. but I didn't angry with him because this just proved how much Harry loves Ginny and I am sure they will be together again. I hope so ... Dumbledore's death I admit that Dumbledore is not one of my top favorite characters in this series but I always found him funny and a bit weird, in a good way, of course. But his death left me in shock because he was actually pleading to Snape but Snape killed him with The Avada Kedavra curse and I thought Snape was on the good side. What will happen now after Dumbledore died?! He is the only one Voldemort is afraid of. I have this feeling that I'll to lose my favorite characters again ... thank you so much for reading and liking my review. hope you all have a great weekend, guys!"

        "text":"4.5 Golden Stars 92% yeah, it was dark, but probably the most Hilarious book of HP; it IS a Comedy! I was rolling in laughter! Hilarious Ron, sassy Harry & Hermione's wittiness & the unique fun in the writing style, the impression, the descriptions, the comparisons. anyway, don't get mad at me, but this book is my least favourite in Harry Potter series. it was kind of disappointment for me. 3 years gap, reading the other fantastic books many times, guessing & after that shocking end in book 5, looking forward to this one, to be greater than others as we are close to end... in one sentence: I was not satisfied after reading it. (IK the book was the calm before the storm, but still.) & don't get me wrong; it was a disappointment Only compared to other HP books. Boring start. (2 chapters without anything related to Hogwarts or the golden trio) Harry was obsessed with what Malfoy was up to, the whole year & for the first time, I found Harry annoying. risking for no good reason, only his hunch. maybe this is the main reason I didn't like this book. (I hate 'Sectumsempra' chapter , always get mad at him.) always yelling: Don't! No! you idiot, Harry! because he is my favourite character... (though now after many times re-reading, at some points, I found those parts hilarious too, ) at the end, he was right though. also, lack of funny sarcastic retorts between Harry & Draco :( almost whole events were like side-jobs (except the... you-know-what) A.K.A the Slug club truth: I don't care about Slughorn either. those chapter he just talked & talked about celebrities once-were-his students... ughhhh. Adrenaline peak parts were not satisfying & not enough (amounts). the whole story was a bit ordinary & nothing happened in the whole school year, in particular. (like school wasn't at an immediate, solid grave danger (book 2, 3, 7 & maybe 5), the golden trio wasn't solving mysteries (1, 2, 4, 5, 7) or something as intriguing as these. they were just attending classes, boring parties, slug club & these normal stuff. though I like the classes & the Hogwarts routine, justt ass I enjoyed in book 5. whenever I missed Hogwarts this book, along with 5, is my go-to. just the Slug club ruined it a little. but in total, other parts (except Malfoy & Slug club); maybe not high peak of adrenaline (as I said), but interesting, & funny; we all wanted to know who the half-blood prince was, Quidditch was great as always & the parts with Dumbledore were fascinating. I liked the second half of the book more, like finally this book stepped into action! & that end was the \"Beginning of the End\"! But main reason: his obsession with Malfoy; 'OMG! Harry, just come off it!' , therefore Harry being annoying, therefore lack of Harry's sarcasm comebacks with Malfoy, lowered this book to my least favourite. However.... on the bright side, there are parts I love too: ❤ sassy Harry was the best! There's no need to call me \"sir\", professor. Bless you JKR! Bless you Harry Potter! one of the sassiest comments in the history of sass masters! my first reaction when I see this, was: whaaaa!?... then \"omg! Harry! did you just...!?\" & re-read the sentence to see if I got it right & then... putting the book down ( \"Hail Harry Potter!\" ) & burst out laughing! & that's that, ever since! although there was no sarcastic comebacks between Potter & Malfoy, but this book had many funny moments by other characters. \"Well, you can’t break an Unbreakable Vow...\" (Gee! Thanks Ron!) \"I’d worked that much out for myself, funnily enough!” & Harry was not just being sassy & sarcastic, but also being funny & clueless too, which was laughable. Ron's jokes with ghosts always made me choke with laughter! ❤ Friendships Harry & Ron's friendship (always one of my favourite brotps) funny, great, looking after each other. always love it, in all books. Roonil Wazlib! also Harry & Hermione's. (especially after Ron & Hermione's bickering), beautiful, caring, protective. again, I love it in all the books. I actually noticed after years of rereading, now Romione has lowered in its place for me & I ship these two more. they care so much for each other. (I'm thinking it's probably also a brotp. well, it's complicated to decide if I want to accept the canon (because I do love canon too) or my mind. the point is, I love the moments with these two together :) ❤ the writing style is just Unique & perfect & funny! ❤ my favourite chapters are \"the Cave\" & \"Horcruxes\"; awesome, exciting with unexpected amount of surprises. I actually loved them. I loved the main-stream parts with Dumbledore. I loved how Harry, at some points, admired Tom. & how he unfolded this story & also sympathized with other characters. ❤ I liked Dumbledore in this book. ❤ at least after that terrible mistake (mentioned above), the chapter ended beautifully; my favourite part, that magical romantic moment, how well described, what a glamorous scene. My first ship finally sinking! \"... After several long moments, or it might have been half an hour-or possibly several sunlit days- they broke apart. The creature in his chest roaring in triumph.\" (& I was really angry when the movie CHANGED this scene! actually I really loved the first 3 movies (they were so similar to the books) & 5 too (tho it was a bit different & they mostly deleted the humor parts), 4 was similar enough, just darker than my imagination. but movies 6 & 7 just had the same quotes (almost) & changed or deleted scenes a lot, therefore those completely disappointed me. :( ❤ & I was proud Harry became Team Captain ! Quidditch were funny, especially the first one ( You Clever Harry! XD ). except not the commentator, but Harry made a funny moment of that too ;) ❤ Don't forget how Gracefully this book was written. (& how delicately Rowling chose to show they were swearing without any direct swears. I love it. it doesn't make me apprehensive, on the contrary, it makes me laugh very hard & respect the pure talent.) Hail Queen! 10th read ; November 2019: I could've given 5 Stars because of Sassy Harry (I mean, Harry just being savagely Sassy this year! XD) & beautiful, magnificent choices of the words & compare to a few of my 5 stars this book definitely deserves 5; but I'm not satisfied with it (still things that annoy me) so I probably won't. Although there's a progress, the rating score has risen to 4.5 now. 13th read ; June 2022: never have read this book this quick! thanks to BR with my new Potterhead !

There were things I'd forgotten, e.g. how late Harry and Ginny got together. I'd also forgotten about most of the funeral. I'll say no more, spoilers oblige . What this book tells me is that sadly the more conservative of readers, grammarians etc will place so many books above Harry Potter #6, none of which is worth mentioning in the same breath as Potter lore. To me this series is special. Nobody else will undertake waiting for each book to come out and lay our hands on them. The Potter universe will belong to our descendants forever. But it was we who helped create this fervor and unmatched popularity."

It's the first time that the Muggle world and the magic one come bluntly face to face. J.K. Rowling chooses that the first chapter of this novel is the right time for this interaction, highlighting the dramatic situation and the necessary cooperation to stem the enemy of all: Lord Voldemort. The bedtime reading for my daughter became less lighthearted and more serious by now. Luckily, for some difficult questions Dumbledore bails me out every time: «It is the unknown we fear when we look upon death and darkness, nothing more» We're almost there, the end of the journey is close. Unfortunately, it will never be the same. Vote: 9 «Era quasi mezzanotte e il Primo Ministro stava seduto da solo nel suo ufficio, a leggere una lunga relazione che gli scivolava via dalla mente senza lasciare la minima traccia» A seguito dei numerosi attacchi dei mangiamorte, Il nuovo Ministro della Magia Rufus Scrimgeour, fresco di nomina, decide di incontrare il Primo Ministro britannico babbano... E' la prima volta che il mondo babbano e quello magico si trovano ad interloquire senza mezzi termini. J.K. Rowling decide che il primo capitolo è il momento giusto per questa interazione, a sottolineare la drammaticità della situazione e la necessaria collaborazione allo scopo di arginare il nemico di tutti: Voldemort. Oramai la lettura serale per mia figlia si è fatta decisamente meno spensierata e più impegnata.

Harry’s Quidditch Captain! Yaaas! 3. Weasleys’ Wizzard Wheezes (Say this ten times) 4. Malfoy’s head on Pansy Parkinson’s lap and Pansy stroking his head. *shudders* 5. Slughorn’s belly preceded him out of the door. Bahaha 6. Potions class has never been this cheerful. Thanks Grampy Sloghorn and Harry has never performed better. Thanks to cheating. Lol. 7. Ron, you bollocks! Stop being an idiot, WonWon! 8. Voldemort as a student seems to me even more sinister than the Dark Lord he already is. *shivers* 9. Like Harry, I am Dumbledore’s man through and through. Take that, Rufus! 10. I’d go back to school anytime if it meant having Professor Dumbledore as a teacher. 11. Aherm! Why do you keep looking for Ginny, now Harry? 12. There’s a reason a Dark Arts teacher stays only for a year. It’s all clear now. 13. Who would have thought that the once timid Ginny will blossom into a confident, beautiful, charming, funny and best of all, snarky girl? 14. Chapter 24 will particularly make you swoon! Gaaah! I ship Harry and Ginny! <3 15. RIP, Aragog. 16. For the first time, I solved the mystery! I have guessed early on in the story that the Half Blood Prince was Snape! Yaaas! 17. I knew there was a reason Harry spent so much time with Professor Dumbledore. I can’t… *sobs* Some of the things\/characters missing in the movie: 1. Kreacher and Dobby 2. Bill and Fleur 3. Dumbledore’s Army and the Order of the Phoenix putting up a fight against the Dark Eaters. 4. . Harry breaking up with Ginny which reminds me of Peter Parker and Mj. Finally, as a simple tribute to the wisest, kindest, most revered and one of the most powerful wizards (whose death out of the many deaths hurts me the most that I cried so much, I may have cried harder than Hagrid), the following is a collection of a few of his great thoughts and words that’ll be forever etched in our hearts. *sniffs* “In fact, being-forgive me- rather cleverer than most men, my mistakes tend to be correspondingly huger.” “People find it a lot easier to forgive others for being wrong than being right.” “It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live.” “Words are, in my not-so-humble opinion, our most inexhaustible source of magic. Capable of both inflicting injury, and remedying it.\" “The pain is part of being human. The fact that you can feel pain like this is your greatest strength.” “To the well organized mind, death is but the next adventure.” “It’s not really goodbye after all.” On a lighter note, it's beautiful Katerina's birthday today, let's spare a few moments to greet her a HAPPIEST BIRTHDAY! Even though you're quite busy for Goodreads and reading atm, I hope you're doing something that's making you happy today!

Times read: 5 One of the best books in this series. It does a great job of combining fun humor with action and heartbreak. My favorite movie is also based off of this book so of course this one will always hold a special place in my heart (although the movie should've included the Room of Requirement subplot because without that, there's a scene in Deathly Hallows Part 2 that doesn't make sense-). The funeral in this book hits harder every time I read. The specific character's death isn't what makes me sad - it's everyone else's reactions, especially Hagrid's. The character (though controversial) meant a lot to so many of the characters and this series wouldn't be the same without him. If you're in the middle of reading this series for the first time, keep reading until you get to this one so that you can experience the highs and lows of Harry's sixth year at Hogwarts. You'll find out about so much stuff that the movie left out and this book is way more fast paced than some of the previous installments. My favorite quotes\/moments from the book: -\"'Will you, Severus, watch over my son, Draco, as he attempts to fulfill the Dark Lord's wishes?' 'I will,' said Snape. A thin tongue of brilliant flame issued from the wand and wound its way around their hands like a red-hot wire. 'And will you, to the best of your ability, to the best of your ability, protect him from harm?' 'I will,' said Snape. A second tongue of flame shot from the wand and interlinked with the first, making a fine, glowing chain. 'And, should it prove necessary... if it seems Draco will fail...' whispered Narcissa (Snape's hand twitched within hers, but he did not draw away), 'will you carry out the deed that the Dark Lord has ordered Draco to perform?' There was a moment's silence. Bellatrix watched, her wand upon their clasped hands, her eyes wide. 'I will,' said Snape. Bellatrix's astounded face glowed red in the blaze of a third tongue of flame, which shot from the wand, twisted with the others, and bound itself thickly around their clasped hands, like a rope, like a fiery snake.\" -\"'Judging by your look of stunned disbelief, Harry did not warn you that I was coming,' said Dumbledore pleasantly. 'However, let us assume that you have invited me warmly into your house.'\" -\"'I would assume that you were going to offer me refreshment,' Dumbledore said to Uncle Vernon, 'but the evidence so far suggests that that would be optimistic to the point of foolishness.'\" -\"The Dursleys, after quick, scared looks at one another, tried to ignore their glasses completely, a difficult feat, as they were nudging them gently on the sides of their heads. Harry could not suppress a suspicion that Dumbledore was rather enjoying himself.\" -\"'You are the rightful owner of number twelve, Grimmauld Place and of Kreacher.' 'Do I - do I have to keep him with me?' Harry asked, aghast as Kreacher thrashed around at his feet. 'Not if you don't want to,' said Dumbledore. 'If I might make a suggestion, you could send him to Hogwarts to work in the kitchen there. In that way, the other house-elves could keep an eye on him.'\" -\"'Hagrid will be delighted,' said Dumbledore, smiling. 'He was thrilled to see Buckbeak again. Incidentally, we have decided, in the interests of Buckbeak's safety, to rechristen him 'Witherwings' for the time being, though I doubt that the Ministry would ever guess he is the hippogriff they once sentenced to death.\" -\"'You have not asked me, for instance, what is my favorite flavor of jam, to check that I am indeed Professor Dumbledore and not an impostor.' 'I didn't...' Harry began, not entirely sure whether he was being reprimanded or not. 'For future reference, Harry, it is raspberry... although of course, if I were a Death Eater, I would have been sure to research my own jam preferences before impersonating myself.'\" -\"And without warning, Dumbledore swooped, plunging the tip of his wand into the seat of the overstuffed armchair, which yelled, 'Ouch!' 'Good evening, Horace,' said Dumbledore, straightening up again. Harry's jaw dropped. Where a split second before there had been an armchair, there now crouched an enormously fat, bald, old man who was massaging his lower belly...\" -\"...he was a big pal of your father's at school. The whole Black family had been in my House, but Sirius ended up in Gryffindor! Shame - he was a talented boy. I got his brother, Regulus, when he came along, but I'd have liked the set.\" -\"All ex-students, all signed. You'll notice Barnabas Cuffe, editor of the Daily Prophet, he's always interested to hear my take on there day's news. And Ambrosius Flume, of Honeydukes - a hamper every birthday, and all because I was able to give him an introduction to Ciceron Harkiss, who gave him his first job! And at the back - you'll see her if you just crane your neck - that's Gwenog Jones, who of course captains the Holyhead Harpies... People are always astonished to hear I'm on first-name terms with the Harpies, and free tickets whenever I want them!\" -\"I hope you will forgive me for mentioning it, Harry, but I am pleased and a little proud at how well you seem to be coping after everything that happened at the Ministry. Permit me to say that I think Sirius would have been proud of you.\" -\"'It was cruel,' said Dumbledore softly, 'that you and Sirius had such a short time together. A brutal ending to what should have been a long and happy relationship.'\" -\"'It's just hard,' Harry said finally, in a low voice, 'to realize he won't write to me again.'\" -\"'...I reazlied I can't shut myself away or - or crack up. Siris wouldn't have wanted that, would he? And anyway, life's too short... Look at Madam Bones, look at Emmeline Vance... It could be me next, couldn't it? But if it is,' he said fiercely, now looking straight into Dumbledore's blue eyes gleaming in the wandlight, 'I'll make sure I take as many Death Eaters with me as I can, and Voldemort too if I can manage it.' 'Spoken both like your mother and father's son and Sirius's true godson!'\" -\"Don't count your owls before they are delivered...\" -\"'Arthur, is that you?' 'Yes,' came Mr. Weasley's weary voice. 'But I would say that even if I were a Death Eater, dear. Ask the question!' 'Oh, honestly...' 'Molly!' 'All right, all right... What is your dearest ambition?' 'To find out how airplanes stay up.'\" -\"'What do you like me to call you when we're alone together?' Even by the dim light of the lantern Harry could tell that Mrs. Weasley had turned bright red; he himself felt suddenly warm around the ears and neck, and hastily gulped soup, clattering his spoon as loudly as he could against the bowl. 'Mollywobbles,' whispered a mortified Mrs. Weasley into the crack at the edge of the door. 'Correct,' said Mr. Weasley. 'Now you can let me in.'\" -\"A young woman was standing in the doorway, a woman of such breathtaking beauty that the room seemed to have become strangely airless. She was tall and willowy with long blonde hair and appeared to emanate a faint, silvery glow. To complete this vision of perfection, she was carrying a heavily laden breakfast tray.\" -\"'You remember my seester, Gabrielle? She never stops talking about 'Arry Potter. She will be delighted to see you again.' 'Oh... is she here too?' Harry croaked. 'No, no, silly boy,' said Fleur with a tinkling laugh, 'I mean next summer, when we - but do you not know?' Her great blue eyes widened and she looked reproachfully at Mrs. Weasley, who said, 'We hadn't got around to telling him yet.' Fleur turned back to Harry, swinging her silvery sheet of hair so that it whipped Mrs. Weasley across the face. 'Bill and I are going to be married!'\" -\"Dumbledore says people find it far easier to forgive others for being wrong than being right...\" -\"Then there was a loud bang and Hermione vanished behind a puff of black smoke. 'Hermione!' shouted Harry and Ron; the breakfast tray slid to the floor with a crash. Hermione emerged, coughing, out of the smoke, clutching the telescope and sporting a brilliantly purplle black eye. 'I squeezed it and it - it punched me!' she gasped. And sure enough, they now saw a tiny fist on a long spring protruding from the end of the telescope.\" -\"He spent most of his days playing two-a-side Quidditch in the Weasleys' orchard (he and Hermione against Ron and Ginny; Hermione was dreadful and Ginny good, so they were reasonably well matched) and his evenings eating triple helpings of everything Mrs. Weasley put in front of him.\" -\"And they've found Igor Karkaroff's body in a shack up north. The Dark Mark had been set over it - well, frankly, I'm surprised he stayed alive for even a year after the Death Eaters; Sirius's brother, Regulus, only managed a few days as far as I can remember.\" -\"'Did you hear about Florean Fortescue, Remus?' asked Bill, who was being plied with wine by Fleur. 'The man who ran-' '-the ice cream place in Diagon Alley?' Harry interrupted, with an unpleasant, hollow sensation in the pit of his stomach. 'He used to give me free ice creams. What's happened to him?' 'Dragged off, by the look of his place.'\" -\"WHY ARE YOU WORRYING ABOUT YOU-KNOW-WHO? YOU SHOULD BE WORRYING ABOUT U-NO-POO - THE CONSTIPATION SENSATION THAT'S GRIPPING THE NATION!\" -\"There were bins full of trick wands, the cheapest merely turning into rubber chickens or pairs of briefs when waved, the most expensive beating the unwary user around the head and neck, and boxes of quills, which came in Self-Inking, Spell-Checking, and Smart-Answer varieties.\" -\"'Patented Daydream Charms...' Hermione had managed to squeeze through to a large display near the counter and was reading the information on the back of a box bearing a highly colored picture of a handsome youth and a swooning girl who were standing on the deck of a pirate ship. 'One simple incantation and you will enter a top-quality, highly realistic, thirty-minute daydream, easy to fit into the average school lesson and virtually undetectable (side effects include vacant expression and minor drooling). Not for sale to under-sixteens. You know,' said Hermione, looking up at Harry, 'that really is extraordinary magic!' 'For that Hermione,' said a voice behind them, 'you can have one for free.' A beaming Fred stood before them, wearing a set of magenta robes that clashed magnificently with his flaming hair.\" -\"'And our Decoy Detonators are just walking off the shelves, look,' said Fred, pointing at a number of weird-looking black horn-type objects that were indeed attempting to scurry out of sight. 'You just drop one surreptitiously and it'll run off and make a nice loud noise out of sight, giving you a diversion if you need one.'\" -\"She was pointing at a number of round balls of fluff in shades of pink and purple, all rolling around the bottom of a cage and emitting high-pitched squeaks. 'Pigmy Puffs,' said George. 'Miniature puff skeins, we can't breed them fast enough.' -\"'That's three Galleons, nine Sickles, and a Knut,' said Fred, examining the many boxes in Ron's arms. 'Cough up.' 'I'm your brother!' 'And that's our stuff you're nicking. Three Galleons, nine Sickles. I'll knock off the Knut.'\" -\"...Bill and I 'ave almost decided on only two bridesmaids, Ginny and Gabrielle will look very sweet togezzer.\" -\"...their departure the following morning was smoother than usual. The Ministry cars glided up to the front of the Burrow to find them waiting, trunks packed; Hermione's cat, Crookshanks. safely enclosed in his traveling basket; and Hedwig; Ron's owl, Pigwidgeon; and Ginny's new purple Pygmy Puff, Arnold, in cages. 'Au revoir, 'Arry,' said Fleur throatily, kissing him good-bye. Ron hurried forward, looking hopeful, but Ginny stuck out her foot and Ron fell, sprawling in the dust at Fleur's feet.\" -\"...indicating Neville's bottom, which was sticking out from under the seat again as he groped around for Trevor, and Luna, who was now wearing her free Spectrespecs, which gave her the look of a demented, multicolored owl. 'They're friends of mine,' said Harry coldly.\" -\"Zabini, who was interrogated after McLaggen, turned out to have a famously beautiful witch for a mother (from what Harry could make out, she had been married seven times, each of her husbands dying mysteriously and leaving her mounds of gold).\" -\"You want to be careful, Blaise! I saw this young lady perform the most marvelous Bat-Bogey Hex as I was passing her carriage! I wouldn't cross her!\" -\"'He saw me hex Zacharias Smith,' said Ginny. 'You remember that idiot from Hufflepuff who was in the D.A.? He kept on and on asking about what happened at the Ministry and in the end he annoyed me so much I hexed him...'\" -\"...she waved her wand; an immense silvery four-legged creature erupted from it and streaked off into the darkness. 'Was that a Patronus?' asked Harry, who had seen Dumbledore send messages like this.\" -\"'I would rather die than betray his trust.' 'That's not saying much, seeing as you're already dead,' Ron observed. 'Once again, you show all the sensitivity of a blunt axe,' said Nearly Headless Nick...\" -\"'My grandmother thinks Charms is a soft option,' mumbled Neville. 'Take Charms,' said Professor McGonagall, 'and I shall drop Augusta a line reminding her that just because she failed her Charms O.W.L., the subject is not necessarily worthless.'\" -\"'Yes,' said Harry stiffly. 'Yes, sir.' 'There's no need to call me 'sir,' Professor.'\" -\"Dear Harry, I would like to start our private lessons this Saturday. Kindly come along to my office at 8 P.M. I hope you are enjoying your first day back at school. Yours sincerely, Albus Dumbledore P.S. I enjoy Acid Pops.\" -\"They chose the one nearest a gold-colored cauldron that was emitting one of the most seductive scents Harry had ever inhaled: Somehow it reminded him simultaneously of treacle tart, the woody smell of a broomstick handle, and something flowery he thought he might have found at the Burrow.\" -\"Good lord, it's clear you've inherited your mother's talent. She was a dab hand at Potions, Lily was! Here you are, then, here you are - one bottle of Felix Felicis, as promised, and use it well!\" -\"...he caught a sudden waft of that flowery smell he had picked up in Slughorn's dungeon. He looked around and saw that Ginny had joined them.\" -\" Hissy, hissy, little snake, Slither on the floor, You be good to Morfin, Or he'll nail you to the door. \" -\"Any Dark object would have been found, I know for a fact Crabbe had a shrunken head confiscated.\" -\"...Harry watched Ginny Weasley playing with Arnold the Pigmy Puff for a while...\" -\"Harry had already attempted a few of the Prince's self-invented spells.

'Aaaaaaaargh!' There was a flash of light and the room was full of voices: Everyone had woken up as Ron had let out a yell.

Harry spun around to see Hermione pointing her wand at Ron, her expression wild; The little flock of birds was speeding like a hail of fat golden bullets toward Ron, who yelped and covered his face with his hands, but the birds attacked, pecking and clawing at every bit of flesh they could reach.\" -\"'Or d'you think she overheard you being rude about Filch? I've always thought there might be something going on between them...' 'Oh, ha ha...' Enjoying the fact that they could speak normally again, they made their way along the deserted, lamp-lit corridors back to the common room, arguing about whether or not Filch and Madam Pince were secretly in love with each other.\" -\"They had just embarked upon the immensely difficult topic of human Transfiguration; working in front of mirrors, they were supposed to be changing the color of their own eyebrows. Hermione laughed unkindly at Ron's disastrous first attempt, during which he somehow managed to give himself a spectacular handlebar mustache...\" -\"'A bit lonely without the D.A.

        "text":"Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince .   There were some things I truly loved about this one. I loved how the bulk of the book, nothing crazy happened. It felt like some of the older books and I love that feeling. All the Harry and Dumbledore time we got, the memories of Voldemort’s past (which were very interesting) and of course Harry and Ginny, who I’ve shipped for a while now finally got their shot. That’s the good. There is also a lot of sadness and despair. A very important and influential character dies. Sides are chosen. People you trust turn out to be not who they say they are (or so we think…) The last 2 hours of this 18 hour audio book broke my heart. I almost want to wait a while to do the final book, but I really want to finish these books by the end of 2016 so I better start it straight away. Wish me luck! I know I’ll need it xoxo"

I thank Harry Potter for my life. Because I don't know where I would be if I didn't have books and I wouldn't have books without starting to read without the series. Hermione Granger is the person who is the role model that I will always remember because she was a leader, she was intelligent, and like me, she was a book person! Books hold the key to knowledge! And knowledge is what Hermione had to get her out of tight spots and get her homework done ON TIME! Harry was amazing because he was courageous , brave, and he did what had to be done to save the people he loved. I will re-read this series over the course of my lifetime many times, because you can't get enough of it!"

        "text":"Harry Potter is a nice enough read, no doubt. I read it during my first English learning stages (after about 9 months of English courses during high school) because the language was so very easy to understand. It was quite entertaining, sure, especially the first three books, but it didn't have a lot of substance. I could easily name a couple of children's fantasy books (not to mention adult ones) I found much more challenging and enthralling than Harry Potter. I guess, I just don't really understand where all the hype is coming from. Actually I thought that from the fourth book onwards the books lost a lot of zeal and became longer and, well, lengthy, too. I lost interest during the fifth book and didn't even start the rest. So, altogether, definitely not bad, but not really special, either. The huge success of this series is probably just one of the things that's always going to be a mystery to me (besides the clever merchandising, of course)."

        "text":"Who doesn't like Harry Potter? I read these as they were coming out, and I was in my twenties, but still sixteen at heart. I was a lover before I even had kids, and I have read these to my own kids since they were in utero. I dove into The Prisoner of Azkaban more times than I can count, and I used to keep it in my purse. Actually, now I still have a book in my purse, even though I carry a small bag. It is always good to have something to read that IS NOT a phone. These first five were kind of the youngster books, because later in the last three, there are more mature issues, death, and overall older-kid content. So, we all grew up with Harry Potter, I like to think. J.K. Rowling is an enchantress who should be remembered for her addictive books and story lines that just don't quit, and for bringing magic into the hearts and minds of the entire world. She opened the door for authors like me, who write fantasy and modern mythology, to be more accepted, I think. I love how Hermoine is clever, and I think Rowling made smart, nerdy girls cool once again. Applause and praise should follow her everywhere."

        "text":"The Sorcerer's Stone: 4\/5 Harry Potter had his life stolen from him before it ever had the chance to begin. He's haunted by nightmares of green explosions and evil laughter. His parents were violently murdered when he was just a baby. He's forced to live with his wicked aunt, uncle and cousin who treat him worse than garbage. His life is a complete disaster until he learns on his eleventh birthday that's he's a wizard destined for great things as well as having already accomplished quite a few of them without even realizing it. Many strange, exciting and dangerous things are waiting for him at Hogwarts; the notorious school for wizards. To say I'm very late to the party is an understatement. Harry Potter was pretty much the only fantasy series I ever heard other people my age talking about when I was younger and they spoiled it for me before I ever had the chance to read it myself. After many years have passed and having read hundreds of other fantasy series, I've forgotten about most of the chatter, hype and spoilers revolving around the critically acclaimed series and I decided it was the perfect time to give it a go. I'm glad I did because I enjoyed it far more than I expected I would. It was fun and witty, adventurous and full of simple yet relatable emotional depth. There were moments that made me feel for the protagonists such as when Harry looked into the Mirror of Erised and saw his dead parents that he desperately wanted to be meet since he was a baby and when Harry solidified his friendship with Ron and Hermione after battling the troll. There were also a lot of charming antics and quips that genuinely made me laugh at times, especially the line regarding Dudley at the very end of the book. The opening chapters didn't intrigue me all that much at first, but once Hagrid was introduced I ended up growing attached to his character and many others that were introduced soon after. Hagrid remained my favorite character to the end of the book. He's intimidating yet a big softy, he loves breeds of creatures that have been shunned and deemed unworthy of affection because of their dangerous reputations, he stands up for the defenseless and he's an all around cool and jolly guy. I like the gentle and mysterious nature of Dumbledore, there's more to him than meets the eye. Snape strikes me as the tragic antihero type that acts cruel to hide his inner insecurities and fear of showing affection do to past trauma. I’m also curious about Voldemort and his relationship with Harry’s parents. Voldy is a creepy, spiteful bastard and he knows how to make an entrance. I'm looking forward to finally getting to know these characters that I've heard so much about. *** Chamber of Secrets: 4\/5 Harry is back at Hogwarts after another brutal summer with the Dursley family and it's not all fun and games when he returns. Snape and Malfoy are still giving him trouble, a malicious voice whispers dark things to him that no one else can hear, someone or something is attacking the students and Harry is framed as the most likely suspect. Harry and his friends have no choice but to put their lives on the line to get to the bottom of things and prevent the destruction of Hogwarts from within by unraveling its many forgotten secrets. A bit of a slow burner in the beginning, but I ended up appreciating the world building regarding the more defined relationships between wizard and muggle societies and how they can coexist, as well as learning about the histories of each respective branch at Hogwarts, especially regarding Slytherin and its connections to both Harry and Voldemort. Another thing I really liked about this book was the well-crafted murder-mystery vibe and the more dark themes of crime and violence sprinkled throughout it. I thought I knew who the culprit was for most of the book, but it turns out that I couldn't have been more wrong. I love being surprised and the revelation of the true culprit was really cool. I can see the series being more plot-focused and mature as it goes on. (Hagrid is still the GOAT and Dumbledore's pretty cool too, even if he's a bit reckless and makes questionable decisions sometimes.) *** Prisoner of Azkaban: 4\/5 The deranged serial killer Sirius Black has broken out of Azkaban; the most brutal and horrifying prison for criminal wizards in the world. Harry has finally had enough of the Dursleys abuse and storms off on his own, not knowing that Sirius Black is searching for him. Omens of death are all around Harry, and this is confirmed in his first divination class at Hogwarts when Professor Trelawney predicts that his time is almost up. At his most trying year at Hogwarts yet, Harry confronts the bizarre horrors of the soul-sucking creatures known as dementors, comes face-to-face with an escaped mass murderer and uncovers the dark secrets that led to his parents tragic deaths. I’m noticing that the themes within the books are slowly getting more dark, mature and personal. It gives the feeling that we’re growing up along with Harry and his friends which is a nice touch. It keeps things interesting and gives a sense of constantly growing danger on the horizon. My favorite part of Prisoner of Azkaban is the introduction of Sirius and Lupin, two interesting and fleshed out characters who have mysterious relations with Harry and his parents. I especially loved the surprising revelation of the ‘true’ villain of this book, shedding some light on what really happened on the day Harry’s parents were killed. The final six or so chapters were the most thrilling stuff I've seen from the series so far. The introduction of the dementors, the psychological thriller elements of betrayal and long lasting grudges being dug up and the looming promise of Voldemort's return made this more intense than Sorcerer's Stone and Chamber of Secrets. More darkness and horror is always welcome in fantasy. Even Ron's pet rat Scabbers gets some huge development that I certainly wasn't expecting. Hagrid is still my favorite character but Sirius and Lupin have quickly worked their way up to my 2nd and 3rd favorites. I also like Hermione much better in this one as she's been easing up on the snobbish attitude and showing some grit. She also stood up for Harry and Ron quite a bit in this one even when they couldn't appreciate what she was doing for them. She's earned my respect. I hear the second half of the series is where all the best stuff happens so I’m excited to be fast approaching that point. *** Goblet of Fire: 5\/5 Goblet of Fire begins with Harry having a dreadful vision of Voldemort conspiring with Wormtail about his destined resurrection to power. He wakes with his scar burning more than ever, reminding him that danger is growing closer and closer. He joins Hermione and the Weasley's at the Quidditch World Cup to take his mind off the constant burning of his scar, only for things to go horribly wrong. When the sign of the dark mark is seen at the event, the imminent return of Voldemort is made known to all. On top of this, Professor Dumbledore announces the return of the Triwizard Tournament, an ancient tradition that allows wizarding schools from all around the world to bond and compete in friendly competition. Things get even worse at Hogwarts when Harry's name is mysteriously drawn from the Goblet of Fire, forcing him to compete in many dangerous competitions against foreign wizarding schools against his will. All while dealing with the pressures of puberty, trying to discover who snuck his name in the Goblet of Fire and the looming threat of Voldemort, Harry faces his most challenging year at Hogwarts yet. The first three books are fun and witty adventure stories with touches of emotional triumph, moral dilemmas and subtle creepiness, but this one completely blows everything that came before it out of the water. The characters are growing and learning about love, religion, slavery, genocide, prejudice, racism and the darker side of the wizarding world. People are starting to die and scandalous truths are being revealed. Traitors as far as the eye can see, double agents hunting down innocent wizards and muggles, Voldemort coming back in full force. The stakes are higher than ever before. So many crazy things happened in this book that completely changed the tone and intensity of the series. The jolly days of childhood are over and the horrors of the world are slowly coming into view. The trials of the Goblet of Fire were exciting and much more interesting than the typical quidditch competitions. The introduction of several other wizarding schools into the story expanded the horizons of the main characters and opened the world to more intriguing possibilities. I’ve learned to appreciate and sympathize with Harry a lot more as he was incredibly brave and noble this time around. His final scene at the end of the book involving a certain act of kindness to Ron’s siblings really solidified the respect I have for him. I also enjoyed his friendship with Cedric. One thing that did annoy me a bit was the mistreatment of Hermione. I always thought she was a much better friend to Harry than Ron, yet both of the boys always seem to take her for granted and never give her the respect she deserves. Even when Harry and Ron have a big falling out over something very childish, Hermione instantly swoops in to support Harry and tries to mend their friendship. And right after the drama between the boys is settled, they go right back to treating Hermione as a third wheel. She deserves better imo. (Hagrid is still the GOAT, his relationship with Madam Maxine made for many entertaining scenes that also introduced some interesting lore regarding the history of giants.) *** Order of the Phoenix: 5\/5 Voldemort is now back in power and wreaking havoc in the shadows. Gathering his army of Death Eaters, releasing dark wizards from their cells in Azkaban, regaining influence over the Dementors, unleashing despair, discord and darkness all around. Harry and Dumbledore want to spread the news of Voldemort's return so they can gather support and plan a counterattack, but the grimy tactics used by the Ministry of Magic to slander their efforts so they can keep themselves in power throws a wrench in the equation. To undermine Dumbledore, the Ministry of Magic employs the delightfully dreadful Dolores Umbridge to dismantle Hogwarts from the inside. With Dolores spreading harmful misinformation, humiliating the teachers, torturing the students and destroying any chance of being able to stand up to Voldemort out of pure ignorance and selfishness, Harry and his friends take matters into their own hands by gathering a rebellious group of young wizards and teaching them all they need to know about defense against the dark arts. Illegally training a private pack of young wizards, dealing with puberty, awkward romance, excessive teen angst, standing up to the corrupt officials running the Ministry of Magic and taking a stand against Voldemort's wicked supporters, Harry has more on his plate than ever before. Order of the Phoenix is a rollercoaster of emotions, mostly negative but in a good way. For example, the main characters got on my nerves more than they ever have. Harry, Ron, Sirius, Hagrid, Snape, Dumbledore and even some of the new characters were painfully selfish and pigheaded at times, yet their reactions to their circumstances were often so realistic and believable that I never viewed them in a way that I felt was poorly written. Rowling does a great job of portraying just how frustratingly self-centered, illogical, petty and obnoxious teens can be at the height of their angst. There were times where Harry was so passive-aggressive, short-tempered and petty that I wanted to slap him silly, but at the same time I perfectly understood his feelings and never blamed him for reacting how he did. Rowling also does a good job of portraying the ignorance, entitlement, close-mindedness and pretentiousness that many adults exhibit as well. Dumbledore makes many mistakes and is often too forgiving for his own good. Snape is a childish jerk that's unjustifiably cruel and unfair, yet his feelings and actions are understandable when you learn the context of his horrific upbringing. Sirius has a lovable rockstar attitude but is sometimes reckless and causes trouble for others. Even Hagrid who normally comes off as a lovable guy is hard to make excuses for this time around because his bad habit of endangering peoples lives with good intentions just keeps getting worse and worse (still love his character though). Then there's Umbridge, the excruciating queen of sass who acts like an amalgamation of every evil school teacher and politician stereotype you can imagine. The teens and adults were equally frustrating, but their character development throughout the story is better than it's ever been. I especially enjoyed the much-desired development of the more minor characters such as Neville. Neville went from being a forgettable side character to being a respectable secondary protagonist with a tragic backstory and an awesome turnaround as he joins Harry in his fight against Voldemort to avenge his parents against Voldemort's most loyal servant Bellatrix. Ginny gets much more personality other than just being known as \"the girl who has a crush on Harry.\" Luna Lovegood is a fun and quirky new character who brings out the best in the others. We get more context about Sirius's dark family history as well as Snape's upsetting background. Hermione is as reliable as ever. Even the comic relief characters Fred and George had quite a few badass moments and I often found their chaotically carefree attitudes endearing. Similar to Goblet of Fire, I really didn't appreciate the mistreatment of Hermione from Harry and Ron once again. They continue to take her for granted, disrespect her and make unnecessary passive-aggressive remarks about her in spite of her constant support. She's a great character, a loyal friend and always has everyone's best interests in mind, but no one seems to give her the respect or affection she deserves. I also felt like Luna suffered similar undeserved treatment this time around. They both deserve better. I did have my gripes here and there, but most were justified and understandable in the context of the plot. The final quarter of the book really escalated things to new heights. A huge climactic battle between Harry's new crew and the Death Eaters, the sudden death of one of the best characters, a heart-wrenching confession from Dumbledore, as well as the foreboding sense that things are bound to get much worse before they get better. Overall, I felt the character work was fantastic and I loved the development of all the side characters. Neville was really the star of the show this time, he had the most triumphant and sympathetic moments. Though he annoyed me for much of the book, Harry himself also got some good development. He realizes that his role models aren't as perfect as he once thought after learning about the questionable choices of Dumbledore, Sirius and his father James. His mess of a relationship with Cho teaching him about romance, respect and empathy. Taking on the role of a teacher and leading a group of rebel wizards around also gave him an opportunity to prove his worth as the lead hero."

I read it during my first English learning stages (after about 9 months of English courses during high school) because the language was so very easy to understand. It was quite entertaining, sure, especially the first three books, but it didn't have a lot of substance. I could easily name a couple of children's fantasy books (not to mention adult ones) I found much more challenging and enthralling than Harry Potter. I guess, I just don't really understand where all the hype is coming from. Actually I thought that from the fourth book onwards the books lost a lot of zeal and became longer and, well, lengthy, too. I lost interest during the fifth book and didn't even start the rest. So, altogether, definitely not bad, but not really special, either. The huge success of this series is probably just one of the things that's always going to be a mystery to me (besides the clever merchandising, of course)."

It is always good to have something to read that IS NOT a phone. These first five were kind of the youngster books, because later in the last three, there are more mature issues, death, and overall older-kid content. So, we all grew up with Harry Potter, I like to think. J.K. Rowling is an enchantress who should be remembered for her addictive books and story lines that just don't quit, and for bringing magic into the hearts and minds of the entire world. She opened the door for authors like me, who write fantasy and modern mythology, to be more accepted, I think. I love how Hermoine is clever, and I think Rowling made smart, nerdy girls cool once again. Applause and praise should follow her everywhere."

        "text":"The Sorcerer's Stone: 4\/5 Harry Potter had his life stolen from him before it ever had the chance to begin. He's haunted by nightmares of green explosions and evil laughter. His parents were violently murdered when he was just a baby. He's forced to live with his wicked aunt, uncle and cousin who treat him worse than garbage. His life is a complete disaster until he learns on his eleventh birthday that's he's a wizard destined for great things as well as having already accomplished quite a few of them without even realizing it. Many strange, exciting and dangerous things are waiting for him at Hogwarts; the notorious school for wizards. To say I'm very late to the party is an understatement. Harry Potter was pretty much the only fantasy series I ever heard other people my age talking about when I was younger and they spoiled it for me before I ever had the chance to read it myself. After many years have passed and having read hundreds of other fantasy series, I've forgotten about most of the chatter, hype and spoilers revolving around the critically acclaimed series and I decided it was the perfect time to give it a go. I'm glad I did because I enjoyed it far more than I expected I would. It was fun and witty, adventurous and full of simple yet relatable emotional depth. There were moments that made me feel for the protagonists such as when Harry looked into the Mirror of Erised and saw his dead parents that he desperately wanted to be meet since he was a baby and when Harry solidified his friendship with Ron and Hermione after battling the troll. There were also a lot of charming antics and quips that genuinely made me laugh at times, especially the line regarding Dudley at the very end of the book. The opening chapters didn't intrigue me all that much at first, but once Hagrid was introduced I ended up growing attached to his character and many others that were introduced soon after. Hagrid remained my favorite character to the end of the book. He's intimidating yet a big softy, he loves breeds of creatures that have been shunned and deemed unworthy of affection because of their dangerous reputations, he stands up for the defenseless and he's an all around cool and jolly guy. I like the gentle and mysterious nature of Dumbledore, there's more to him than meets the eye. Snape strikes me as the tragic antihero type that acts cruel to hide his inner insecurities and fear of showing affection do to past trauma. I’m also curious about Voldemort and his relationship with Harry’s parents. Voldy is a creepy, spiteful bastard and he knows how to make an entrance. I'm looking forward to finally getting to know these characters that I've heard so much about. *** Chamber of Secrets: 4\/5 Harry is back at Hogwarts after another brutal summer with the Dursley family and it's not all fun and games when he returns. Snape and Malfoy are still giving him trouble, a malicious voice whispers dark things to him that no one else can hear, someone or something is attacking the students and Harry is framed as the most likely suspect. Harry and his friends have no choice but to put their lives on the line to get to the bottom of things and prevent the destruction of Hogwarts from within by unraveling its many forgotten secrets. A bit of a slow burner in the beginning, but I ended up appreciating the world building regarding the more defined relationships between wizard and muggle societies and how they can coexist, as well as learning about the histories of each respective branch at Hogwarts, especially regarding Slytherin and its connections to both Harry and Voldemort. Another thing I really liked about this book was the well-crafted murder-mystery vibe and the more dark themes of crime and violence sprinkled throughout it. I thought I knew who the culprit was for most of the book, but it turns out that I couldn't have been more wrong. I love being surprised and the revelation of the true culprit was really cool. I can see the series being more plot-focused and mature as it goes on. (Hagrid is still the GOAT and Dumbledore's pretty cool too, even if he's a bit reckless and makes questionable decisions sometimes.) *** Prisoner of Azkaban: 4\/5 The deranged serial killer Sirius Black has broken out of Azkaban; the most brutal and horrifying prison for criminal wizards in the world. Harry has finally had enough of the Dursleys abuse and storms off on his own, not knowing that Sirius Black is searching for him. Omens of death are all around Harry, and this is confirmed in his first divination class at Hogwarts when Professor Trelawney predicts that his time is almost up. At his most trying year at Hogwarts yet, Harry confronts the bizarre horrors of the soul-sucking creatures known as dementors, comes face-to-face with an escaped mass murderer and uncovers the dark secrets that led to his parents tragic deaths. I’m noticing that the themes within the books are slowly getting more dark, mature and personal. It gives the feeling that we’re growing up along with Harry and his friends which is a nice touch. It keeps things interesting and gives a sense of constantly growing danger on the horizon. My favorite part of Prisoner of Azkaban is the introduction of Sirius and Lupin, two interesting and fleshed out characters who have mysterious relations with Harry and his parents. I especially loved the surprising revelation of the ‘true’ villain of this book, shedding some light on what really happened on the day Harry’s parents were killed. The final six or so chapters were the most thrilling stuff I've seen from the series so far. The introduction of the dementors, the psychological thriller elements of betrayal and long lasting grudges being dug up and the looming promise of Voldemort's return made this more intense than Sorcerer's Stone and Chamber of Secrets. More darkness and horror is always welcome in fantasy. Even Ron's pet rat Scabbers gets some huge development that I certainly wasn't expecting. Hagrid is still my favorite character but Sirius and Lupin have quickly worked their way up to my 2nd and 3rd favorites. I also like Hermione much better in this one as she's been easing up on the snobbish attitude and showing some grit. She also stood up for Harry and Ron quite a bit in this one even when they couldn't appreciate what she was doing for them. She's earned my respect. I hear the second half of the series is where all the best stuff happens so I’m excited to be fast approaching that point. *** Goblet of Fire: 5\/5 Goblet of Fire begins with Harry having a dreadful vision of Voldemort conspiring with Wormtail about his destined resurrection to power. He wakes with his scar burning more than ever, reminding him that danger is growing closer and closer. He joins Hermione and the Weasley's at the Quidditch World Cup to take his mind off the constant burning of his scar, only for things to go horribly wrong. When the sign of the dark mark is seen at the event, the imminent return of Voldemort is made known to all. On top of this, Professor Dumbledore announces the return of the Triwizard Tournament, an ancient tradition that allows wizarding schools from all around the world to bond and compete in friendly competition. Things get even worse at Hogwarts when Harry's name is mysteriously drawn from the Goblet of Fire, forcing him to compete in many dangerous competitions against foreign wizarding schools against his will. All while dealing with the pressures of puberty, trying to discover who snuck his name in the Goblet of Fire and the looming threat of Voldemort, Harry faces his most challenging year at Hogwarts yet. The first three books are fun and witty adventure stories with touches of emotional triumph, moral dilemmas and subtle creepiness, but this one completely blows everything that came before it out of the water. The characters are growing and learning about love, religion, slavery, genocide, prejudice, racism and the darker side of the wizarding world. People are starting to die and scandalous truths are being revealed. Traitors as far as the eye can see, double agents hunting down innocent wizards and muggles, Voldemort coming back in full force. The stakes are higher than ever before. So many crazy things happened in this book that completely changed the tone and intensity of the series. The jolly days of childhood are over and the horrors of the world are slowly coming into view. The trials of the Goblet of Fire were exciting and much more interesting than the typical quidditch competitions. The introduction of several other wizarding schools into the story expanded the horizons of the main characters and opened the world to more intriguing possibilities. I’ve learned to appreciate and sympathize with Harry a lot more as he was incredibly brave and noble this time around. His final scene at the end of the book involving a certain act of kindness to Ron’s siblings really solidified the respect I have for him. I also enjoyed his friendship with Cedric. One thing that did annoy me a bit was the mistreatment of Hermione. I always thought she was a much better friend to Harry than Ron, yet both of the boys always seem to take her for granted and never give her the respect she deserves. Even when Harry and Ron have a big falling out over something very childish, Hermione instantly swoops in to support Harry and tries to mend their friendship. And right after the drama between the boys is settled, they go right back to treating Hermione as a third wheel. She deserves better imo. (Hagrid is still the GOAT, his relationship with Madam Maxine made for many entertaining scenes that also introduced some interesting lore regarding the history of giants.) *** Order of the Phoenix: 5\/5 Voldemort is now back in power and wreaking havoc in the shadows. Gathering his army of Death Eaters, releasing dark wizards from their cells in Azkaban, regaining influence over the Dementors, unleashing despair, discord and darkness all around. Harry and Dumbledore want to spread the news of Voldemort's return so they can gather support and plan a counterattack, but the grimy tactics used by the Ministry of Magic to slander their efforts so they can keep themselves in power throws a wrench in the equation. To undermine Dumbledore, the Ministry of Magic employs the delightfully dreadful Dolores Umbridge to dismantle Hogwarts from the inside. With Dolores spreading harmful misinformation, humiliating the teachers, torturing the students and destroying any chance of being able to stand up to Voldemort out of pure ignorance and selfishness, Harry and his friends take matters into their own hands by gathering a rebellious group of young wizards and teaching them all they need to know about defense against the dark arts. Illegally training a private pack of young wizards, dealing with puberty, awkward romance, excessive teen angst, standing up to the corrupt officials running the Ministry of Magic and taking a stand against Voldemort's wicked supporters, Harry has more on his plate than ever before. Order of the Phoenix is a rollercoaster of emotions, mostly negative but in a good way. For example, the main characters got on my nerves more than they ever have. Harry, Ron, Sirius, Hagrid, Snape, Dumbledore and even some of the new characters were painfully selfish and pigheaded at times, yet their reactions to their circumstances were often so realistic and believable that I never viewed them in a way that I felt was poorly written. Rowling does a great job of portraying just how frustratingly self-centered, illogical, petty and obnoxious teens can be at the height of their angst. There were times where Harry was so passive-aggressive, short-tempered and petty that I wanted to slap him silly, but at the same time I perfectly understood his feelings and never blamed him for reacting how he did. Rowling also does a good job of portraying the ignorance, entitlement, close-mindedness and pretentiousness that many adults exhibit as well. Dumbledore makes many mistakes and is often too forgiving for his own good. Snape is a childish jerk that's unjustifiably cruel and unfair, yet his feelings and actions are understandable when you learn the context of his horrific upbringing. Sirius has a lovable rockstar attitude but is sometimes reckless and causes trouble for others. Even Hagrid who normally comes off as a lovable guy is hard to make excuses for this time around because his bad habit of endangering peoples lives with good intentions just keeps getting worse and worse (still love his character though). Then there's Umbridge, the excruciating queen of sass who acts like an amalgamation of every evil school teacher and politician stereotype you can imagine. The teens and adults were equally frustrating, but their character development throughout the story is better than it's ever been. I especially enjoyed the much-desired development of the more minor characters such as Neville. Neville went from being a forgettable side character to being a respectable secondary protagonist with a tragic backstory and an awesome turnaround as he joins Harry in his fight against Voldemort to avenge his parents against Voldemort's most loyal servant Bellatrix. Ginny gets much more personality other than just being known as \"the girl who has a crush on Harry.\" Luna Lovegood is a fun and quirky new character who brings out the best in the others. We get more context about Sirius's dark family history as well as Snape's upsetting background. Hermione is as reliable as ever. Even the comic relief characters Fred and George had quite a few badass moments and I often found their chaotically carefree attitudes endearing. Similar to Goblet of Fire, I really didn't appreciate the mistreatment of Hermione from Harry and Ron once again. They continue to take her for granted, disrespect her and make unnecessary passive-aggressive remarks about her in spite of her constant support. She's a great character, a loyal friend and always has everyone's best interests in mind, but no one seems to give her the respect or affection she deserves. I also felt like Luna suffered similar undeserved treatment this time around. They both deserve better. I did have my gripes here and there, but most were justified and understandable in the context of the plot. The final quarter of the book really escalated things to new heights. A huge climactic battle between Harry's new crew and the Death Eaters, the sudden death of one of the best characters, a heart-wrenching confession from Dumbledore, as well as the foreboding sense that things are bound to get much worse before they get better. Overall, I felt the character work was fantastic and I loved the development of all the side characters. Neville was really the star of the show this time, he had the most triumphant and sympathetic moments. Though he annoyed me for much of the book, Harry himself also got some good development. He realizes that his role models aren't as perfect as he once thought after learning about the questionable choices of Dumbledore, Sirius and his father James. His mess of a relationship with Cho teaching him about romance, respect and empathy. Taking on the role of a teacher and leading a group of rebel wizards around also gave him an opportunity to prove his worth as the lead hero."

Hermione Granger is the person who is the role model that I will always remember because she was a leader, she was intelligent, and like me, she was a book person! Books hold the key to knowledge! And knowledge is what Hermione had to get her out of tight spots and get her homework done ON TIME! Harry was amazing because he was courageous , brave, and he did what had to be done to save the people he loved.

I read it during my first English learning stages (after about 9 months of English courses during high school) because the language was so very easy to understand. It was quite entertaining, sure, especially the first three books, but it didn't have a lot of substance. I could easily name a couple of children's fantasy books (not to mention adult ones) I found much more challenging and enthralling than Harry Potter. I guess, I just don't really understand where all the hype is coming from. Actually I thought that from the fourth book onwards the books lost a lot of zeal and became longer and, well, lengthy, too. I lost interest during the fifth book and didn't even start the rest. So, altogether, definitely not bad, but not really special, either. The huge success of this series is probably just one of the things that's always going to be a mystery to me (besides the clever merchandising, of course)."

I was a lover before I even had kids, and I have read these to my own kids since they were in utero. I dove into The Prisoner of Azkaban more times than I can count, and I used to keep it in my purse. Actually, now I still have a book in my purse, even though I carry a small bag. It is always good to have something to read that IS NOT a phone. These first five were kind of the youngster books, because later in the last three, there are more mature issues, death, and overall older-kid content. So, we all grew up with Harry Potter, I like to think. J.K. Rowling is an enchantress who should be remembered for her addictive books and story lines that just don't quit, and for bringing magic into the hearts and minds of the entire world. She opened the door for authors like me, who write fantasy and modern mythology, to be more accepted, I think. I love how Hermoine is clever, and I think Rowling made smart, nerdy girls cool once again. Applause and praise should follow her everywhere."

        "text":"The Sorcerer's Stone: 4\/5 Harry Potter had his life stolen from him before it ever had the chance to begin. He's haunted by nightmares of green explosions and evil laughter. His parents were violently murdered when he was just a baby. He's forced to live with his wicked aunt, uncle and cousin who treat him worse than garbage. His life is a complete disaster until he learns on his eleventh birthday that's he's a wizard destined for great things as well as having already accomplished quite a few of them without even realizing it. Many strange, exciting and dangerous things are waiting for him at Hogwarts; the notorious school for wizards. To say I'm very late to the party is an understatement. Harry Potter was pretty much the only fantasy series I ever heard other people my age talking about when I was younger and they spoiled it for me before I ever had the chance to read it myself. After many years have passed and having read hundreds of other fantasy series, I've forgotten about most of the chatter, hype and spoilers revolving around the critically acclaimed series and I decided it was the perfect time to give it a go. I'm glad I did because I enjoyed it far more than I expected I would. It was fun and witty, adventurous and full of simple yet relatable emotional depth. There were moments that made me feel for the protagonists such as when Harry looked into the Mirror of Erised and saw his dead parents that he desperately wanted to be meet since he was a baby and when Harry solidified his friendship with Ron and Hermione after battling the troll. There were also a lot of charming antics and quips that genuinely made me laugh at times, especially the line regarding Dudley at the very end of the book. The opening chapters didn't intrigue me all that much at first, but once Hagrid was introduced I ended up growing attached to his character and many others that were introduced soon after. Hagrid remained my favorite character to the end of the book. He's intimidating yet a big softy, he loves breeds of creatures that have been shunned and deemed unworthy of affection because of their dangerous reputations, he stands up for the defenseless and he's an all around cool and jolly guy. I like the gentle and mysterious nature of Dumbledore, there's more to him than meets the eye. Snape strikes me as the tragic antihero type that acts cruel to hide his inner insecurities and fear of showing affection do to past trauma. I’m also curious about Voldemort and his relationship with Harry’s parents. Voldy is a creepy, spiteful bastard and he knows how to make an entrance. I'm looking forward to finally getting to know these characters that I've heard so much about. *** Chamber of Secrets: 4\/5 Harry is back at Hogwarts after another brutal summer with the Dursley family and it's not all fun and games when he returns. Snape and Malfoy are still giving him trouble, a malicious voice whispers dark things to him that no one else can hear, someone or something is attacking the students and Harry is framed as the most likely suspect. Harry and his friends have no choice but to put their lives on the line to get to the bottom of things and prevent the destruction of Hogwarts from within by unraveling its many forgotten secrets. A bit of a slow burner in the beginning, but I ended up appreciating the world building regarding the more defined relationships between wizard and muggle societies and how they can coexist, as well as learning about the histories of each respective branch at Hogwarts, especially regarding Slytherin and its connections to both Harry and Voldemort. Another thing I really liked about this book was the well-crafted murder-mystery vibe and the more dark themes of crime and violence sprinkled throughout it. I thought I knew who the culprit was for most of the book, but it turns out that I couldn't have been more wrong. I love being surprised and the revelation of the true culprit was really cool. I can see the series being more plot-focused and mature as it goes on. (Hagrid is still the GOAT and Dumbledore's pretty cool too, even if he's a bit reckless and makes questionable decisions sometimes.) *** Prisoner of Azkaban: 4\/5 The deranged serial killer Sirius Black has broken out of Azkaban; the most brutal and horrifying prison for criminal wizards in the world. Harry has finally had enough of the Dursleys abuse and storms off on his own, not knowing that Sirius Black is searching for him. Omens of death are all around Harry, and this is confirmed in his first divination class at Hogwarts when Professor Trelawney predicts that his time is almost up. At his most trying year at Hogwarts yet, Harry confronts the bizarre horrors of the soul-sucking creatures known as dementors, comes face-to-face with an escaped mass murderer and uncovers the dark secrets that led to his parents tragic deaths. I’m noticing that the themes within the books are slowly getting more dark, mature and personal. It gives the feeling that we’re growing up along with Harry and his friends which is a nice touch. It keeps things interesting and gives a sense of constantly growing danger on the horizon. My favorite part of Prisoner of Azkaban is the introduction of Sirius and Lupin, two interesting and fleshed out characters who have mysterious relations with Harry and his parents. I especially loved the surprising revelation of the ‘true’ villain of this book, shedding some light on what really happened on the day Harry’s parents were killed. The final six or so chapters were the most thrilling stuff I've seen from the series so far. The introduction of the dementors, the psychological thriller elements of betrayal and long lasting grudges being dug up and the looming promise of Voldemort's return made this more intense than Sorcerer's Stone and Chamber of Secrets. More darkness and horror is always welcome in fantasy. Even Ron's pet rat Scabbers gets some huge development that I certainly wasn't expecting. Hagrid is still my favorite character but Sirius and Lupin have quickly worked their way up to my 2nd and 3rd favorites. I also like Hermione much better in this one as she's been easing up on the snobbish attitude and showing some grit. She also stood up for Harry and Ron quite a bit in this one even when they couldn't appreciate what she was doing for them. She's earned my respect. I hear the second half of the series is where all the best stuff happens so I’m excited to be fast approaching that point. *** Goblet of Fire: 5\/5 Goblet of Fire begins with Harry having a dreadful vision of Voldemort conspiring with Wormtail about his destined resurrection to power. He wakes with his scar burning more than ever, reminding him that danger is growing closer and closer. He joins Hermione and the Weasley's at the Quidditch World Cup to take his mind off the constant burning of his scar, only for things to go horribly wrong. When the sign of the dark mark is seen at the event, the imminent return of Voldemort is made known to all. On top of this, Professor Dumbledore announces the return of the Triwizard Tournament, an ancient tradition that allows wizarding schools from all around the world to bond and compete in friendly competition. Things get even worse at Hogwarts when Harry's name is mysteriously drawn from the Goblet of Fire, forcing him to compete in many dangerous competitions against foreign wizarding schools against his will. All while dealing with the pressures of puberty, trying to discover who snuck his name in the Goblet of Fire and the looming threat of Voldemort, Harry faces his most challenging year at Hogwarts yet. The first three books are fun and witty adventure stories with touches of emotional triumph, moral dilemmas and subtle creepiness, but this one completely blows everything that came before it out of the water. The characters are growing and learning about love, religion, slavery, genocide, prejudice, racism and the darker side of the wizarding world. People are starting to die and scandalous truths are being revealed. Traitors as far as the eye can see, double agents hunting down innocent wizards and muggles, Voldemort coming back in full force. The stakes are higher than ever before. So many crazy things happened in this book that completely changed the tone and intensity of the series. The jolly days of childhood are over and the horrors of the world are slowly coming into view. The trials of the Goblet of Fire were exciting and much more interesting than the typical quidditch competitions. The introduction of several other wizarding schools into the story expanded the horizons of the main characters and opened the world to more intriguing possibilities. I’ve learned to appreciate and sympathize with Harry a lot more as he was incredibly brave and noble this time around. His final scene at the end of the book involving a certain act of kindness to Ron’s siblings really solidified the respect I have for him. I also enjoyed his friendship with Cedric. One thing that did annoy me a bit was the mistreatment of Hermione. I always thought she was a much better friend to Harry than Ron, yet both of the boys always seem to take her for granted and never give her the respect she deserves. Even when Harry and Ron have a big falling out over something very childish, Hermione instantly swoops in to support Harry and tries to mend their friendship. And right after the drama between the boys is settled, they go right back to treating Hermione as a third wheel. She deserves better imo. (Hagrid is still the GOAT, his relationship with Madam Maxine made for many entertaining scenes that also introduced some interesting lore regarding the history of giants.) *** Order of the Phoenix: 5\/5 Voldemort is now back in power and wreaking havoc in the shadows. Gathering his army of Death Eaters, releasing dark wizards from their cells in Azkaban, regaining influence over the Dementors, unleashing despair, discord and darkness all around. Harry and Dumbledore want to spread the news of Voldemort's return so they can gather support and plan a counterattack, but the grimy tactics used by the Ministry of Magic to slander their efforts so they can keep themselves in power throws a wrench in the equation. To undermine Dumbledore, the Ministry of Magic employs the delightfully dreadful Dolores Umbridge to dismantle Hogwarts from the inside. With Dolores spreading harmful misinformation, humiliating the teachers, torturing the students and destroying any chance of being able to stand up to Voldemort out of pure ignorance and selfishness, Harry and his friends take matters into their own hands by gathering a rebellious group of young wizards and teaching them all they need to know about defense against the dark arts. Illegally training a private pack of young wizards, dealing with puberty, awkward romance, excessive teen angst, standing up to the corrupt officials running the Ministry of Magic and taking a stand against Voldemort's wicked supporters, Harry has more on his plate than ever before. Order of the Phoenix is a rollercoaster of emotions, mostly negative but in a good way. For example, the main characters got on my nerves more than they ever have. Harry, Ron, Sirius, Hagrid, Snape, Dumbledore and even some of the new characters were painfully selfish and pigheaded at times, yet their reactions to their circumstances were often so realistic and believable that I never viewed them in a way that I felt was poorly written. Rowling does a great job of portraying just how frustratingly self-centered, illogical, petty and obnoxious teens can be at the height of their angst. There were times where Harry was so passive-aggressive, short-tempered and petty that I wanted to slap him silly, but at the same time I perfectly understood his feelings and never blamed him for reacting how he did. Rowling also does a good job of portraying the ignorance, entitlement, close-mindedness and pretentiousness that many adults exhibit as well. Dumbledore makes many mistakes and is often too forgiving for his own good. Snape is a childish jerk that's unjustifiably cruel and unfair, yet his feelings and actions are understandable when you learn the context of his horrific upbringing. Sirius has a lovable rockstar attitude but is sometimes reckless and causes trouble for others. Even Hagrid who normally comes off as a lovable guy is hard to make excuses for this time around because his bad habit of endangering peoples lives with good intentions just keeps getting worse and worse (still love his character though). Then there's Umbridge, the excruciating queen of sass who acts like an amalgamation of every evil school teacher and politician stereotype you can imagine. The teens and adults were equally frustrating, but their character development throughout the story is better than it's ever been. I especially enjoyed the much-desired development of the more minor characters such as Neville. Neville went from being a forgettable side character to being a respectable secondary protagonist with a tragic backstory and an awesome turnaround as he joins Harry in his fight against Voldemort to avenge his parents against Voldemort's most loyal servant Bellatrix. Ginny gets much more personality other than just being known as \"the girl who has a crush on Harry.\" Luna Lovegood is a fun and quirky new character who brings out the best in the others. We get more context about Sirius's dark family history as well as Snape's upsetting background. Hermione is as reliable as ever. Even the comic relief characters Fred and George had quite a few badass moments and I often found their chaotically carefree attitudes endearing. Similar to Goblet of Fire, I really didn't appreciate the mistreatment of Hermione from Harry and Ron once again. They continue to take her for granted, disrespect her and make unnecessary passive-aggressive remarks about her in spite of her constant support. She's a great character, a loyal friend and always has everyone's best interests in mind, but no one seems to give her the respect or affection she deserves. I also felt like Luna suffered similar undeserved treatment this time around. They both deserve better. I did have my gripes here and there, but most were justified and understandable in the context of the plot. The final quarter of the book really escalated things to new heights. A huge climactic battle between Harry's new crew and the Death Eaters, the sudden death of one of the best characters, a heart-wrenching confession from Dumbledore, as well as the foreboding sense that things are bound to get much worse before they get better. Overall, I felt the character work was fantastic and I loved the development of all the side characters. Neville was really the star of the show this time, he had the most triumphant and sympathetic moments. Though he annoyed me for much of the book, Harry himself also got some good development. He realizes that his role models aren't as perfect as he once thought after learning about the questionable choices of Dumbledore, Sirius and his father James. His mess of a relationship with Cho teaching him about romance, respect and empathy. Taking on the role of a teacher and leading a group of rebel wizards around also gave him an opportunity to prove his worth as the lead hero."

    "desc":"In the early fall of 2002, famed travel Writer Bill Bryson journeyed to Kenya at the invitation of CARE International, the charity dedicated to working with local communities to eradicate poverty around the world. He arrived with a set of mental images of Africa gleaned from television broadcasts of low-budget Jungle Jim movies in his Iowa childhood and a single viewing of the film version of Out of Africa. (Also with some worries about tropical diseases, insects and large predators.) But the vibrant reality of Kenya and its people took over the second he deplaned in Nairobi, and this diary records Bill Bryson's impresssions of his trip with his inimitable trademark style of wry observation and curious insight. From the wrenching poverty of the Kibera slum in Nairobi to the meticulously manicured grounds of the Karen Blixen house and the human fossil riches of the National Museum, Bryson registers the striking contrasts of a postcolonial society in transition. He visits the astoundingly vast Great Rift Valley; undergoes the rigors of a teeth-rattling train journey to Mombasa and a hair-whitening flight through a vicious storm; and visits the refugee camps and the agricultural and economic projects where dedicated CARE professionals wage noble and dogged war against poverty, dislocation and corruption.",

        "text":"CARE, an international aid agency headquartered in the UK, asked Bill Bryson to visit their Kenyan operation and write about it. Somewhere along the lines the idea changed to include publishing a \"book\" and using all profits as a donation to charity, with a small amount of the $12 cover price used for printing and distribution costs. Most of the participants were volunteering their time. Sounds like a great idea, right? Except, the book itself is disappointing. It's more a novelette. It's 40 pages in an undersized book with big margins. About 90% of the content is him worrying about dying in the trains, planes and automobiles that might crash along his journey. Only about 10% covered actual Kenyan life and country. Almost no history was included in complete contrast to the book I read prior, In a Sunburned Country. It's not that it's badly written -- but it could have been so much better. He visits a refugee camp and barely talks about it for a paragraph, while devoting three pages to the airplane flight back. He visits a micro-lending organization and spends a sentence talking about his interaction with the borrowers. Ironically, he praises a local Kenyan farmer growing non-indigenous crops, the same action he highly criticized in In a Sunburned Country for damaging the Australian outback. This was a great idea under-executed. And it's a shame, because I think had it been done right, say trade the hard cover for an additional 40-50 pages of content, and this would have been great. Having a better story would have sold more books making even more money for the charity. I'll give him a C for Charity, but a D for leaving the real story out of the book. Bill short changed himself, Kenya, and CARE by pulling his punches in the name of charity."

        "text":"All the Bryson goodness you've come to know and love at half the calories! Actually, it's more like a 10th the size. In fact, the worst part about Bill Bryson's African Diary is its shortness. This slim volume is more about awareness and philanthropy rather than a literary or journalistic endeavor for its own sake. Bryson heads to Kenya to check out CARE International's charitable works. Times are tough there. Clean drinking water is at a premium. There's some slight heart-string pulling, but it's not Sally Struthers sappy. Just the right amount of compassion. Tidbits of Bryson's trademark humor are wedged in between the descriptions of the ravaged slums and gorgeous beaches. His style and low-key flair are present in small quantities. This would be perfect for the Bryson noob who wanted to test the waters before diving into the deep end of his more chunky books."

        "text":"In 2002, CARE International invited Bill Bryson on an eight day trip to tour its humanitarian work in Kenya with him writing it up into this, Bill Bryson’s African Diary (something of a misnomer as Bryson only visits Kenya). The entire proceeds of the short book will go to help the kinds of people depicted inside it - and it’s a wonderful read too! As you would expect, the horrors of the country’s widespread poverty aren’t ignored as Bryson visits Kibera, a shanty town on the outskirts of Kenya’s capital city Nairobi, with a population of between 700,000 and 1 million people. The conditions are appalling and thousands are HIV positive and yet the place officially doesn’t exist and is ignored by the Kenyan government. He also visits a refugee camp where the people there are stuck in a bureaucratic limbo, stateless, just existing, with little chance of a future. But the book isn’t all a sobering guilt trip as Bryson also takes in the wonders of the Kenyan National Museum which houses 500 of the roughly 5000 fossilized human bones in existence, and Olorgasailie, an area where early humans made tools for a million years! There are also gently humorous passages in Bryson’s inimitable style involving the dangerous and poorly maintained railways and the nightmare of flying in a light aircraft during a storm. The most interesting and inspiring part was seeing a bank called Wedco give loans to develop small businesses, helping give some of these people a shot at a real life that they wouldn’t have without it. And the small village of Ogongo Tir where CARE installed a new well for them but gave them responsibility over it underlining that, while they need a hand to get the ball rolling, the people there want to take control of their own destinies rather than depend forever on the West. I hesitate to use the word but Bill Bryson’s African Diary is entertaining, as well as informative, with Bryson serving as a genial conduit to learning about CARE International and its outstanding work in Kenya. It’s a quick read but a memorable and moving one with an excellent cause at its heart - well worth picking up especially as the purchase price goes to help these people’s lives become a little better."

I am an enormous Bill Bryson fan -- I've read everything else he has published (with the exception of \"Shakespeare: The World as Stage\" which I'm starting tonight). Unfortunately, this sort of wasn't a Bill Bryson book. It was a Bill Bryson... journal entry. It was only 49 pages, and because it was done for charity, it was overly sincere. It almost completely lacked Bryson's signature humor. He normally has such a colorful way of describing things that I even enjoyed his science book, \"A Short History of Nearly Everything.\" This was more like 49 pages of \"Kenya is a real shithole and the people need help.\" Nevertheless, I wish I was able to give it more stars, because I just like him so much, and because it is for charity. So, you know, go spend the money so it goes to CARE, but don't expect to spend more than an hour with it, and don't expect the kind of laughs I can still conjure up just by thinking of certain scenes in \"A Walk in the Woods.\""

        "text":"First of all, this is not a book. It's a diary. Bryson recounts his 8 days in Kenya with members of CARE International. And that's 7 days longer than I'd want to be there. What a dreadful place! Poverty, crime, hunger, lack of sanitation, no clean water, disease, corrupt government and a hostile climate. Some of the other reviewers on Goodreads fault Bryson for not covering enough ground, but I disagree. You don't need to read 300 pages to see the terrible conditions in which these people live EVERY DAY OF THEIR LIVES! This short \"booklet\" is enough to make the point. And if you read between the lines you will notice that Bryson runs us through a gamut of emotions ranging from humor before the journey, to fear about the trip, to disgust upon arrival, to sympathy when connecting with the locals, to enlightenment when he understands that the solution to the problems are within reach. I checked out the Kindle edition from the Chicago Public Library at no charge so I am donating $10 to Care.org to cover the donation that would have gone to them with a bookstore purchase. If you read my review and read a Kindle edition please do the same. We CAN make a difference. Thank you."

No se puede rascar más. Llevado a Kenya como parte de un proyecto de caridad liderado por CARE International, Bill Bryson nos muestra las diferentes iniciativas que la organización ha llevado a cabo en el país a fin de dotar de cierta independencia alimenticia a sus ciudadanos más desfavorecidos. Como no podía ser de otro modo, su sentido del humor ayuda a paliar un poco la imagen tan angustiosa que la gente que vive en urbes improvisadas. Me hubiese gustado que se hubiese extendido más, contando más anécdotas o directamente hablando más del país. Sin embargo los capítulos, si bien interesantes, se hacen demasiado cortos. No ha sido suficiente como para quitarme las ganas de Bill Bryson... habrá que ir a por otro."

        "text":"__________________________ Charity should begin at home, but should not stay there. –– Phillips Brooks Bill Bryson went to Africa at the request of CARE International to write about the good work that organization was doing in Kenya. That was generous of him. It was kind. It was a great act of benevolence. He is a better man than I am. I tend to be rather miserly and parsimonious and keep my pennies, nickels, and dimes in a jar guarded by my cat. While in Africa, Mr. Bryson took some notes. They are, in general, no more interesting than my college notes from freshman chemistry. His notes are now entitled African Diary . He says all proceeds from the sale of the African Diary will go to charity, and I believe him––he is, I’m sure, an honest man. Unfortunately Mr. Bryson expects his loyal fans [and I am one] to read these memoranda he casually jotted down while he was in Africa––I don’t know why. I have never done him any harm that I can remember. I was gravely disappointed. They are just notes. He never intended them to be published when he took them. Instead of paying for this book, send Bryson some money he can give to CARE. While you’re at it, send his publisher some money for postage so they can send any African diaries they still have in stock to CARE along with the cash. The diaries are terrifically dry and will make excellent kindling, and they won’t do the recipients any harm––as long as those recipients can’t read English. ★★ for the “Diaries,” and I’m being charitable. ★★★★★ for Bill Bryson’s act of charity. Note: Mr. Bryson sells his African notes for $12. I am willing to part with my chemistry notes for $10.99. All of the proceeds will go into a Grande Mocha Latte, double pumped. I am willing to share."

        "text":"This is a pretty short travelogue (a week's diary) written as part of an initiative from CARE to bring in visibility and focus to the enormous challenges being faced in Africa, and the stellar work that CARE and similar organisations are doing. Kudos to the thought behind this initiative, inventive and world-wise enough to know the innovative channels to tap to bring in the much-needed publicity. I'm not going to be patting the backs of Bryson and the publishers too much, because no-profit doesn't mean that all costs were borne by themselves (CARE would have still had to pay for all the expenses of the tour and the printing costs), and the no-profit tag is being applied only financially. About the book itself, it started off breezily in Bryson- esque fashion, and has enough Bryson isms thrown in, in terms of facts, numbers, large-picture observations, that-could-be-me-thinking-that thoughts, and self-effacing humour. There is nothing of the touristy Kenya that I anticipated, with the trip sticking to the various camps and places that CARE is working upon. However, just when I was settling in a bit, the book ended, leaving me to get off the table with just the appetizers served. So, don't expect Bryson writing about game drives in Masai Mara and watching flamingos in Lake Nakuru, or the typical Bryson research into the fantastic work being carried out, or any comprehensive write-up about the history of the camps, challenges and way forward. The intent is purely to provide a glimpse at what CARE does, without getting into much detailing, and it sure does its job, as it pushed me into doing a bit more online reading about it."

Much more po-faced and worthy than I thought, with all the aid recipients 'saintly' and 'deserving' and inspirational. Also hampered with first world guilt and the western tendency to take responsibility for everyone else. Oh, we built them wells but they fell into disrepair because we hadn't instructed them in how to maintain them. Endless self-flagellation and castigation and resolution to do things better. Oh the government in question is corrupt and siphoning off millions of dollars. Why don't international bodies like the IMF step in and stop this? Paternalistic and patronising, treating African nations like half-wit children."

        "text":"I have enjoyed reading Bryson’s travel books. He has a lovely sense of humor and he is knowledgeable. I started reading this book looking forward to the author’s impressions of Africa. Actually, I was keen to see how it compares with Paul Theroux’s views on the same continent. But, what a disappointment! First of all, it is just a diary of a few days’ travel in Kenya, that too just a few hundred kilometers out of Nairobi, all on the benevolence of a charity organization which hired him to write some nice propaganda material for them. To call it an African Diary is misrepresentation. On top of it, it is just a pamphlet running into 49 pages, but costing a whopping $11.99 for its kindle edition. In the interest of his own admiring readers, the author should have mentioned in the cover that it was a journey paid and supported by CARE, one of the many charities working in Africa. It does not matter that he took no money to produce this piece of work or whether CARE is a great charity organization. In any case, the booklet is of dubious quality, something that does not do justice to Bryson’s reputation. He visits a large slum outside Nairobi called Kibare and writes about its inhabitants that they will undergo any hardship in order that their children will have a better life. Not exactly a new finding, one might think. He also flies to Dadaab, near the Somali border, to visit a refugee camp of 134000 Somalis for a day. In between, he manages to visit the National Museum to view some of the rare early human remains which are housed there, followed by visits to the Karen Blixen house and the Rift Valley. The author steps into some controversial territory in this booklet by batting for charity outfits like CARE, Oxfam and ‘Save the Children’ with the following statements: “If anyone ever tries to suggest to you that donor money sent to Africa goes into African despots’ pockets, you must poke them in the eye. Money given to aid agencies like CARE goes straight into projects”. There is a lot of research which shows that nowadays, many charities, NGOs, the UNHCR are all actually businesses chasing the vast billions of donor money that is available and that their first aim is to perpetuate and grow themselves. Michael Maren, who spent nineteen years in Africa – in Kenya, Somalia, Burkina Faso, Rwanda and Ethiopia – reporting on the famine, civil war and military conflicts in the region, is on record severely criticising the role of CARE, Save the Children and the UNHCR as self-serving enterprises, where these organizations care less about the victims of famine and civil war and more about their own organizational interests. Even Paul Theroux, who spent many years in Africa on multiple trips, is a severe critic of these aid organizations as doing much harm in the name of development. In fact, even the author’s own account confirms these impressions inadvertently. The CARE representative who accompanies Bryson to Dadaab, says, “It is a fundamental part of aid protocol that you cannot make conditions better for refugees than they are for their hosts outside the camps. It wouldn’t be fair and it would breed resentment. Everyone would then want to be a refugee. So, you can only do so much”. The Kenyan govt would not allow permanent improvements to the slums of Kibera because it would then encourage others to move in there, making it larger. Even in the refugee camps at Dadaab, the Kenyan govt would not relocate the 134000 Somalis to Nairobi or Mombasa to look for work and livelihood and become self-sufficient. So, the refugees are struck in Dadaab because they can’t go back to Somalia either due to the civil war. In both Kibera and Dadaab, the outcome is to keep the status quo - the slum dwellers to remain as slum dwellers and the refugees to remain as refugees, which lets charity organizations to endlessly ask for money from donors to continue supporting them. It is something like pharmaceutical companies preferring chronic diseases rather than curable diseases because they get patients as lifelong customers with chronic diseases. The final pages of the book contain promotional material from CARE which states in the section ‘Facts about Poverty’ that nearly half of humanity struggled to survive on less than $2 a day as of 2002, when the book was published. This is at best questionable because researchers like Dr. Hans Rosling have shown, using publicly available UN documents, that this statement was true in 1966, but since then poverty has continuosly declined to the point that in 2016, it was just 9% of the world population which lives under $2 a day. This has been possible mainly due to Globalization of the world economy rather than charities and NGOs. False pronouncements on poverty only succeed in giving credence to the criticism that aid organizations exaggerate humanitarian problems in order to shock donors into continue supporting them. In short, a forgettable book from Bill Bryson."

        "text":"There are a handful of writers whose books I will buy without hesitation, secure in the knowledge that my money will be well-spent. Bill Bryson is one of these: each of his books is a joy to read, chock full of painstakingly researched material, presented in the author's inimitably chatty, humorous and irresistible style. I've read all his travel books (and some of his non-travel related books), so when I finally came across African Diary - which I'd heard about, never seen in a bookshop - I pounced on it. Bill Bryson's African Diary is aptly titled: it's a short (very short - even less than a hundred pages) diary of an eight-day trip to Kenya. International aid organisation CARE invited Bryson on this trip, escorted by their own staff members, to see the work they were doing in Kenya. The diary is an account of how Bryson spent a whirlwind week in Nairobi and other parts of the country - both urban and rural, seeing for himself the problems as well as the triumphs of CARE, and the people themselves. This is a quick read, not merely because it's a slim book, but also because Bryson tells his story so well, making this a mix of so many things. There are heartrending and horrifying descriptions of living conditions in the largest slum in Kenya - possibly in Africa - where there are 10 latrines for 40,000 people. There are stories, both far-fetched 'traveller's tales' and all too real ones of everything from dire poverty to crime to shocking corruption (at the time African Diary was written, Kenya was the 6th most corrupt country in the world, with $10 billion disappearing annually from public funds). Bryson writes about all of these - and also of hope, of innovations and developments that help local people stand on their own feet, and better their lot without being dependent on others. He talks about the lives of real people: of a farmer who's been pulled back from the brink, a woman entrepreneur, villagers whose lives were turned around because a well was dug. And, Bryson being the travel writer he is, there are always the brief interludes describing trips - by road, by air (a harrowing flight in a small aircraft, for example), all peppered with Bryson's superb sense of humour. I wouldn't call this Bryson's best book; it's far too short for that. By the time I really got my teeth into it and had settled in, it was over. It is, however, very readable and informative. And it's for a good cause - all proceeds from the sales of Bill Bryson's African Diary go to CARE, and towards helping those in need of that aid."

I placed the thing on hold sight unseen with my library, and only when I stopped by to check it out did I find a volume rather slimmer than I had expected. Well, I'm a big Bill Bryson fan, so I hoped that it would at least be just under 50 pages of typical Bryson fun. Alas, even in that I was disappointed. He certainly has his moments here, but more than anything this is about CARE and it lacks the humor and insight and depth of narration that I would expect. It's not like this couldn't have been longer. Bryson was in Kenya for 8 days, and he hints at a busy schedule over this time that certainly could have filled up a bit more written space. But all we get as readers is a fleeting glimpse of things. The most in-depth description of an experience has little to do with Kenya: instead it describes the harrowing landing of a small charter plane they took for one piece of the trip. The brief glimpses of Bryson's signature style bumped this into a two-star affair. But I am rating this as a book, and not as a promotional pamphlet, and for that reason I can't give it any more stars than that. There's just not enough there."

And since it's Bill Bryson, it had to be funny, yet I have to say I didn't appreciate some of the jokes, it's not OK to joke about people killed in a tragic train crash, for example. It was also good to learn about CARE organization too and their efforts to fight world poverty. One must also note that he could've talked more about Kenya and Kenyans, it could've been much more profound. A large part of it was describing his own experiences and fears, which I don't think was fair to the cause he was sent to support."

You’re not in Kansas anymore. You’re in Kenya. Bill has been contracted to ”write something” about the work of CARE, a charity organisation. They give hime an eight days free trip to Kenya, and what they get is around 50 pages where he praises himself for working for free, and whines about how he is going to die in accidents or diseases.

        "text":"CARE, an international aid agency headquartered in the UK, asked Bill Bryson to visit their Kenyan operation and write about it. Somewhere along the lines the idea changed to include publishing a \"book\" and using all profits as a donation to charity, with a small amount of the $12 cover price used for printing and distribution costs. Most of the participants were volunteering their time. Sounds like a great idea, right? Except, the book itself is disappointing. It's more a novelette. It's 40 pages in an undersized book with big margins. About 90% of the content is him worrying about dying in the trains, planes and automobiles that might crash along his journey. Only about 10% covered actual Kenyan life and country. Almost no history was included in complete contrast to the book I read prior, In a Sunburned Country. It's not that it's badly written -- but it could have been so much better. He visits a refugee camp and barely talks about it for a paragraph, while devoting three pages to the airplane flight back. He visits a micro-lending organization and spends a sentence talking about his interaction with the borrowers. Ironically, he praises a local Kenyan farmer growing non-indigenous crops, the same action he highly criticized in In a Sunburned Country for damaging the Australian outback. This was a great idea under-executed. And it's a shame, because I think had it been done right, say trade the hard cover for an additional 40-50 pages of content, and this would have been great. Having a better story would have sold more books making even more money for the charity. I'll give him a C for Charity, but a D for leaving the real story out of the book. Bill short changed himself, Kenya, and CARE by pulling his punches in the name of charity."

Bryson heads to Kenya to check out CARE International's charitable works. Times are tough there. Clean drinking water is at a premium. There's some slight heart-string pulling, but it's not Sally Struthers sappy. Just the right amount of compassion. Tidbits of Bryson's trademark humor are wedged in between the descriptions of the ravaged slums and gorgeous beaches. His style and low-key flair are present in small quantities.

        "text":"In 2002, CARE International invited Bill Bryson on an eight day trip to tour its humanitarian work in Kenya with him writing it up into this, Bill Bryson’s African Diary (something of a misnomer as Bryson only visits Kenya). The entire proceeds of the short book will go to help the kinds of people depicted inside it - and it’s a wonderful read too! As you would expect, the horrors of the country’s widespread poverty aren’t ignored as Bryson visits Kibera, a shanty town on the outskirts of Kenya’s capital city Nairobi, with a population of between 700,000 and 1 million people. The conditions are appalling and thousands are HIV positive and yet the place officially doesn’t exist and is ignored by the Kenyan government. He also visits a refugee camp where the people there are stuck in a bureaucratic limbo, stateless, just existing, with little chance of a future. But the book isn’t all a sobering guilt trip as Bryson also takes in the wonders of the Kenyan National Museum which houses 500 of the roughly 5000 fossilized human bones in existence, and Olorgasailie, an area where early humans made tools for a million years! There are also gently humorous passages in Bryson’s inimitable style involving the dangerous and poorly maintained railways and the nightmare of flying in a light aircraft during a storm. The most interesting and inspiring part was seeing a bank called Wedco give loans to develop small businesses, helping give some of these people a shot at a real life that they wouldn’t have without it. And the small village of Ogongo Tir where CARE installed a new well for them but gave them responsibility over it underlining that, while they need a hand to get the ball rolling, the people there want to take control of their own destinies rather than depend forever on the West. I hesitate to use the word but Bill Bryson’s African Diary is entertaining, as well as informative, with Bryson serving as a genial conduit to learning about CARE International and its outstanding work in Kenya. It’s a quick read but a memorable and moving one with an excellent cause at its heart - well worth picking up especially as the purchase price goes to help these people’s lives become a little better."

What a dreadful place! Poverty, crime, hunger, lack of sanitation, no clean water, disease, corrupt government and a hostile climate. Some of the other reviewers on Goodreads fault Bryson for not covering enough ground, but I disagree. You don't need to read 300 pages to see the terrible conditions in which these people live EVERY DAY OF THEIR LIVES! This short \"booklet\" is enough to make the point. And if you read between the lines you will notice that Bryson runs us through a gamut of emotions ranging from humor before the journey, to fear about the trip, to disgust upon arrival, to sympathy when connecting with the locals, to enlightenment when he understands that the solution to the problems are within reach. I checked out the Kindle edition from the Chicago Public Library at no charge so I am donating $10 to Care.org to cover the donation that would have gone to them with a bookstore purchase. If you read my review and read a Kindle edition please do the same. We CAN make a difference. Thank you."

That was generous of him. It was kind. It was a great act of benevolence. He is a better man than I am. I tend to be rather miserly and parsimonious and keep my pennies, nickels, and dimes in a jar guarded by my cat. While in Africa, Mr. Bryson took some notes. They are, in general, no more interesting than my college notes from freshman chemistry. His notes are now entitled African Diary . He says all proceeds from the sale of the African Diary will go to charity, and I believe him––he is, I’m sure, an honest man. Unfortunately Mr. Bryson expects his loyal fans [and I am one] to read these memoranda he casually jotted down while he was in Africa––I don’t know why. I have never done him any harm that I can remember. I was gravely disappointed. They are just notes. He never intended them to be published when he took them. Instead of paying for this book, send Bryson some money he can give to CARE. While you’re at it, send his publisher some money for postage so they can send any African diaries they still have in stock to CARE along with the cash. The diaries are terrifically dry and will make excellent kindling, and they won’t do the recipients any harm––as long as those recipients can’t read English. ★★ for the “Diaries,” and I’m being charitable. ★★★★★ for Bill Bryson’s act of charity. Note: Mr. Bryson sells his African notes for $12. I am willing to part with my chemistry notes for $10.99. All of the proceeds will go into a Grande Mocha Latte, double pumped. I am willing to share."

Kudos to the thought behind this initiative, inventive and world-wise enough to know the innovative channels to tap to bring in the much-needed publicity. I'm not going to be patting the backs of Bryson and the publishers too much, because no-profit doesn't mean that all costs were borne by themselves (CARE would have still had to pay for all the expenses of the tour and the printing costs), and the no-profit tag is being applied only financially. About the book itself, it started off breezily in Bryson- esque fashion, and has enough Bryson isms thrown in, in terms of facts, numbers, large-picture observations, that-could-be-me-thinking-that thoughts, and self-effacing humour. There is nothing of the touristy Kenya that I anticipated, with the trip sticking to the various camps and places that CARE is working upon. However, just when I was settling in a bit, the book ended, leaving me to get off the table with just the appetizers served. So, don't expect Bryson writing about game drives in Masai Mara and watching flamingos in Lake Nakuru, or the typical Bryson research into the fantastic work being carried out, or any comprehensive write-up about the history of the camps, challenges and way forward. The intent is purely to provide a glimpse at what CARE does, without getting into much detailing, and it sure does its job, as it pushed me into doing a bit more online reading about it."

        "text":"I have enjoyed reading Bryson’s travel books. He has a lovely sense of humor and he is knowledgeable. I started reading this book looking forward to the author’s impressions of Africa. Actually, I was keen to see how it compares with Paul Theroux’s views on the same continent. But, what a disappointment! First of all, it is just a diary of a few days’ travel in Kenya, that too just a few hundred kilometers out of Nairobi, all on the benevolence of a charity organization which hired him to write some nice propaganda material for them. To call it an African Diary is misrepresentation. On top of it, it is just a pamphlet running into 49 pages, but costing a whopping $11.99 for its kindle edition. In the interest of his own admiring readers, the author should have mentioned in the cover that it was a journey paid and supported by CARE, one of the many charities working in Africa. It does not matter that he took no money to produce this piece of work or whether CARE is a great charity organization. In any case, the booklet is of dubious quality, something that does not do justice to Bryson’s reputation. He visits a large slum outside Nairobi called Kibare and writes about its inhabitants that they will undergo any hardship in order that their children will have a better life. Not exactly a new finding, one might think. He also flies to Dadaab, near the Somali border, to visit a refugee camp of 134000 Somalis for a day. In between, he manages to visit the National Museum to view some of the rare early human remains which are housed there, followed by visits to the Karen Blixen house and the Rift Valley. The author steps into some controversial territory in this booklet by batting for charity outfits like CARE, Oxfam and ‘Save the Children’ with the following statements: “If anyone ever tries to suggest to you that donor money sent to Africa goes into African despots’ pockets, you must poke them in the eye. Money given to aid agencies like CARE goes straight into projects”. There is a lot of research which shows that nowadays, many charities, NGOs, the UNHCR are all actually businesses chasing the vast billions of donor money that is available and that their first aim is to perpetuate and grow themselves. Michael Maren, who spent nineteen years in Africa – in Kenya, Somalia, Burkina Faso, Rwanda and Ethiopia – reporting on the famine, civil war and military conflicts in the region, is on record severely criticising the role of CARE, Save the Children and the UNHCR as self-serving enterprises, where these organizations care less about the victims of famine and civil war and more about their own organizational interests. Even Paul Theroux, who spent many years in Africa on multiple trips, is a severe critic of these aid organizations as doing much harm in the name of development. In fact, even the author’s own account confirms these impressions inadvertently. The CARE representative who accompanies Bryson to Dadaab, says, “It is a fundamental part of aid protocol that you cannot make conditions better for refugees than they are for their hosts outside the camps. It wouldn’t be fair and it would breed resentment. Everyone would then want to be a refugee. So, you can only do so much”. The Kenyan govt would not allow permanent improvements to the slums of Kibera because it would then encourage others to move in there, making it larger. Even in the refugee camps at Dadaab, the Kenyan govt would not relocate the 134000 Somalis to Nairobi or Mombasa to look for work and livelihood and become self-sufficient. So, the refugees are struck in Dadaab because they can’t go back to Somalia either due to the civil war. In both Kibera and Dadaab, the outcome is to keep the status quo - the slum dwellers to remain as slum dwellers and the refugees to remain as refugees, which lets charity organizations to endlessly ask for money from donors to continue supporting them. It is something like pharmaceutical companies preferring chronic diseases rather than curable diseases because they get patients as lifelong customers with chronic diseases. The final pages of the book contain promotional material from CARE which states in the section ‘Facts about Poverty’ that nearly half of humanity struggled to survive on less than $2 a day as of 2002, when the book was published. This is at best questionable because researchers like Dr. Hans Rosling have shown, using publicly available UN documents, that this statement was true in 1966, but since then poverty has continuosly declined to the point that in 2016, it was just 9% of the world population which lives under $2 a day. This has been possible mainly due to Globalization of the world economy rather than charities and NGOs. False pronouncements on poverty only succeed in giving credence to the criticism that aid organizations exaggerate humanitarian problems in order to shock donors into continue supporting them. In short, a forgettable book from Bill Bryson."

Bill Bryson is one of these: each of his books is a joy to read, chock full of painstakingly researched material, presented in the author's inimitably chatty, humorous and irresistible style. I've read all his travel books (and some of his non-travel related books), so when I finally came across African Diary - which I'd heard about, never seen in a bookshop - I pounced on it. Bill Bryson's African Diary is aptly titled: it's a short (very short - even less than a hundred pages) diary of an eight-day trip to Kenya. International aid organisation CARE invited Bryson on this trip, escorted by their own staff members, to see the work they were doing in Kenya. The diary is an account of how Bryson spent a whirlwind week in Nairobi and other parts of the country - both urban and rural, seeing for himself the problems as well as the triumphs of CARE, and the people themselves. This is a quick read, not merely because it's a slim book, but also because Bryson tells his story so well, making this a mix of so many things. There are heartrending and horrifying descriptions of living conditions in the largest slum in Kenya - possibly in Africa - where there are 10 latrines for 40,000 people. There are stories, both far-fetched 'traveller's tales' and all too real ones of everything from dire poverty to crime to shocking corruption (at the time African Diary was written, Kenya was the 6th most corrupt country in the world, with $10 billion disappearing annually from public funds). Bryson writes about all of these - and also of hope, of innovations and developments that help local people stand on their own feet, and better their lot without being dependent on others. He talks about the lives of real people: of a farmer who's been pulled back from the brink, a woman entrepreneur, villagers whose lives were turned around because a well was dug. And, Bryson being the travel writer he is, there are always the brief interludes describing trips - by road, by air (a harrowing flight in a small aircraft, for example), all peppered with Bryson's superb sense of humour. I wouldn't call this Bryson's best book; it's far too short for that. By the time I really got my teeth into it and had settled in, it was over. It is, however, very readable and informative. And it's for a good cause - all proceeds from the sales of Bill Bryson's African Diary go to CARE, and towards helping those in need of that aid."

I placed the thing on hold sight unseen with my library, and only when I stopped by to check it out did I find a volume rather slimmer than I had expected. Well, I'm a big Bill Bryson fan, so I hoped that it would at least be just under 50 pages of typical Bryson fun. Alas, even in that I was disappointed. He certainly has his moments here, but more than anything this is about CARE and it lacks the humor and insight and depth of narration that I would expect. It's not like this couldn't have been longer. Bryson was in Kenya for 8 days, and he hints at a busy schedule over this time that certainly could have filled up a bit more written space. But all we get as readers is a fleeting glimpse of things. The most in-depth description of an experience has little to do with Kenya: instead it describes the harrowing landing of a small charter plane they took for one piece of the trip. The brief glimpses of Bryson's signature style bumped this into a two-star affair. But I am rating this as a book, and not as a promotional pamphlet, and for that reason I can't give it any more stars than that. There's just not enough there."

It was also good to learn about CARE organization too and their efforts to fight world poverty. One must also note that he could've talked more about Kenya and Kenyans, it could've been much more profound. A large part of it was describing his own experiences and fears, which I don't think was fair to the cause he was sent to support."

Somewhere along the lines the idea changed to include publishing a \"book\" and using all profits as a donation to charity, with a small amount of the $12 cover price used for printing and distribution costs. Most of the participants were volunteering their time. Sounds like a great idea, right? Except, the book itself is disappointing. It's more a novelette. It's 40 pages in an undersized book with big margins. About 90% of the content is him worrying about dying in the trains, planes and automobiles that might crash along his journey. Only about 10% covered actual Kenyan life and country. Almost no history was included in complete contrast to the book I read prior, In a Sunburned Country. It's not that it's badly written -- but it could have been so much better. He visits a refugee camp and barely talks about it for a paragraph, while devoting three pages to the airplane flight back. He visits a micro-lending organization and spends a sentence talking about his interaction with the borrowers. Ironically, he praises a local Kenyan farmer growing non-indigenous crops, the same action he highly criticized in In a Sunburned Country for damaging the Australian outback. This was a great idea under-executed. And it's a shame, because I think had it been done right, say trade the hard cover for an additional 40-50 pages of content, and this would have been great. Having a better story would have sold more books making even more money for the charity. I'll give him a C for Charity, but a D for leaving the real story out of the book. Bill short changed himself, Kenya, and CARE by pulling his punches in the name of charity."

In fact, the worst part about Bill Bryson's African Diary is its shortness. This slim volume is more about awareness and philanthropy rather than a literary or journalistic endeavor for its own sake. Bryson heads to Kenya to check out CARE International's charitable works. Times are tough there. Clean drinking water is at a premium. There's some slight heart-string pulling, but it's not Sally Struthers sappy. Just the right amount of compassion. Tidbits of Bryson's trademark humor are wedged in between the descriptions of the ravaged slums and gorgeous beaches. His style and low-key flair are present in small quantities.

        "text":"In 2002, CARE International invited Bill Bryson on an eight day trip to tour its humanitarian work in Kenya with him writing it up into this, Bill Bryson’s African Diary (something of a misnomer as Bryson only visits Kenya). The entire proceeds of the short book will go to help the kinds of people depicted inside it - and it’s a wonderful read too! As you would expect, the horrors of the country’s widespread poverty aren’t ignored as Bryson visits Kibera, a shanty town on the outskirts of Kenya’s capital city Nairobi, with a population of between 700,000 and 1 million people. The conditions are appalling and thousands are HIV positive and yet the place officially doesn’t exist and is ignored by the Kenyan government. He also visits a refugee camp where the people there are stuck in a bureaucratic limbo, stateless, just existing, with little chance of a future. But the book isn’t all a sobering guilt trip as Bryson also takes in the wonders of the Kenyan National Museum which houses 500 of the roughly 5000 fossilized human bones in existence, and Olorgasailie, an area where early humans made tools for a million years! There are also gently humorous passages in Bryson’s inimitable style involving the dangerous and poorly maintained railways and the nightmare of flying in a light aircraft during a storm. The most interesting and inspiring part was seeing a bank called Wedco give loans to develop small businesses, helping give some of these people a shot at a real life that they wouldn’t have without it. And the small village of Ogongo Tir where CARE installed a new well for them but gave them responsibility over it underlining that, while they need a hand to get the ball rolling, the people there want to take control of their own destinies rather than depend forever on the West. I hesitate to use the word but Bill Bryson’s African Diary is entertaining, as well as informative, with Bryson serving as a genial conduit to learning about CARE International and its outstanding work in Kenya. It’s a quick read but a memorable and moving one with an excellent cause at its heart - well worth picking up especially as the purchase price goes to help these people’s lives become a little better."

What a dreadful place! Poverty, crime, hunger, lack of sanitation, no clean water, disease, corrupt government and a hostile climate. Some of the other reviewers on Goodreads fault Bryson for not covering enough ground, but I disagree. You don't need to read 300 pages to see the terrible conditions in which these people live EVERY DAY OF THEIR LIVES! This short \"booklet\" is enough to make the point. And if you read between the lines you will notice that Bryson runs us through a gamut of emotions ranging from humor before the journey, to fear about the trip, to disgust upon arrival, to sympathy when connecting with the locals, to enlightenment when he understands that the solution to the problems are within reach. I checked out the Kindle edition from the Chicago Public Library at no charge so I am donating $10 to Care.org to cover the donation that would have gone to them with a bookstore purchase. If you read my review and read a Kindle edition please do the same. We CAN make a difference. Thank you."

That was generous of him. It was kind. It was a great act of benevolence. He is a better man than I am. I tend to be rather miserly and parsimonious and keep my pennies, nickels, and dimes in a jar guarded by my cat. While in Africa, Mr. Bryson took some notes. They are, in general, no more interesting than my college notes from freshman chemistry. His notes are now entitled African Diary . He says all proceeds from the sale of the African Diary will go to charity, and I believe him––he is, I’m sure, an honest man. Unfortunately Mr. Bryson expects his loyal fans [and I am one] to read these memoranda he casually jotted down while he was in Africa––I don’t know why. I have never done him any harm that I can remember. I was gravely disappointed. They are just notes. He never intended them to be published when he took them. Instead of paying for this book, send Bryson some money he can give to CARE. While you’re at it, send his publisher some money for postage so they can send any African diaries they still have in stock to CARE along with the cash. The diaries are terrifically dry and will make excellent kindling, and they won’t do the recipients any harm––as long as those recipients can’t read English. ★★ for the “Diaries,” and I’m being charitable. ★★★★★ for Bill Bryson’s act of charity. Note: Mr. Bryson sells his African notes for $12. I am willing to part with my chemistry notes for $10.99. All of the proceeds will go into a Grande Mocha Latte, double pumped. I am willing to share."

Kudos to the thought behind this initiative, inventive and world-wise enough to know the innovative channels to tap to bring in the much-needed publicity. I'm not going to be patting the backs of Bryson and the publishers too much, because no-profit doesn't mean that all costs were borne by themselves (CARE would have still had to pay for all the expenses of the tour and the printing costs), and the no-profit tag is being applied only financially. About the book itself, it started off breezily in Bryson- esque fashion, and has enough Bryson isms thrown in, in terms of facts, numbers, large-picture observations, that-could-be-me-thinking-that thoughts, and self-effacing humour. There is nothing of the touristy Kenya that I anticipated, with the trip sticking to the various camps and places that CARE is working upon. However, just when I was settling in a bit, the book ended, leaving me to get off the table with just the appetizers served. So, don't expect Bryson writing about game drives in Masai Mara and watching flamingos in Lake Nakuru, or the typical Bryson research into the fantastic work being carried out, or any comprehensive write-up about the history of the camps, challenges and way forward. The intent is purely to provide a glimpse at what CARE does, without getting into much detailing, and it sure does its job, as it pushed me into doing a bit more online reading about it."

        "text":"I have enjoyed reading Bryson’s travel books. He has a lovely sense of humor and he is knowledgeable. I started reading this book looking forward to the author’s impressions of Africa. Actually, I was keen to see how it compares with Paul Theroux’s views on the same continent. But, what a disappointment! First of all, it is just a diary of a few days’ travel in Kenya, that too just a few hundred kilometers out of Nairobi, all on the benevolence of a charity organization which hired him to write some nice propaganda material for them. To call it an African Diary is misrepresentation. On top of it, it is just a pamphlet running into 49 pages, but costing a whopping $11.99 for its kindle edition. In the interest of his own admiring readers, the author should have mentioned in the cover that it was a journey paid and supported by CARE, one of the many charities working in Africa. It does not matter that he took no money to produce this piece of work or whether CARE is a great charity organization. In any case, the booklet is of dubious quality, something that does not do justice to Bryson’s reputation. He visits a large slum outside Nairobi called Kibare and writes about its inhabitants that they will undergo any hardship in order that their children will have a better life. Not exactly a new finding, one might think. He also flies to Dadaab, near the Somali border, to visit a refugee camp of 134000 Somalis for a day. In between, he manages to visit the National Museum to view some of the rare early human remains which are housed there, followed by visits to the Karen Blixen house and the Rift Valley. The author steps into some controversial territory in this booklet by batting for charity outfits like CARE, Oxfam and ‘Save the Children’ with the following statements: “If anyone ever tries to suggest to you that donor money sent to Africa goes into African despots’ pockets, you must poke them in the eye. Money given to aid agencies like CARE goes straight into projects”. There is a lot of research which shows that nowadays, many charities, NGOs, the UNHCR are all actually businesses chasing the vast billions of donor money that is available and that their first aim is to perpetuate and grow themselves. Michael Maren, who spent nineteen years in Africa – in Kenya, Somalia, Burkina Faso, Rwanda and Ethiopia – reporting on the famine, civil war and military conflicts in the region, is on record severely criticising the role of CARE, Save the Children and the UNHCR as self-serving enterprises, where these organizations care less about the victims of famine and civil war and more about their own organizational interests. Even Paul Theroux, who spent many years in Africa on multiple trips, is a severe critic of these aid organizations as doing much harm in the name of development. In fact, even the author’s own account confirms these impressions inadvertently. The CARE representative who accompanies Bryson to Dadaab, says, “It is a fundamental part of aid protocol that you cannot make conditions better for refugees than they are for their hosts outside the camps. It wouldn’t be fair and it would breed resentment. Everyone would then want to be a refugee. So, you can only do so much”. The Kenyan govt would not allow permanent improvements to the slums of Kibera because it would then encourage others to move in there, making it larger. Even in the refugee camps at Dadaab, the Kenyan govt would not relocate the 134000 Somalis to Nairobi or Mombasa to look for work and livelihood and become self-sufficient. So, the refugees are struck in Dadaab because they can’t go back to Somalia either due to the civil war. In both Kibera and Dadaab, the outcome is to keep the status quo - the slum dwellers to remain as slum dwellers and the refugees to remain as refugees, which lets charity organizations to endlessly ask for money from donors to continue supporting them. It is something like pharmaceutical companies preferring chronic diseases rather than curable diseases because they get patients as lifelong customers with chronic diseases. The final pages of the book contain promotional material from CARE which states in the section ‘Facts about Poverty’ that nearly half of humanity struggled to survive on less than $2 a day as of 2002, when the book was published. This is at best questionable because researchers like Dr. Hans Rosling have shown, using publicly available UN documents, that this statement was true in 1966, but since then poverty has continuosly declined to the point that in 2016, it was just 9% of the world population which lives under $2 a day. This has been possible mainly due to Globalization of the world economy rather than charities and NGOs. False pronouncements on poverty only succeed in giving credence to the criticism that aid organizations exaggerate humanitarian problems in order to shock donors into continue supporting them. In short, a forgettable book from Bill Bryson."

Bill Bryson is one of these: each of his books is a joy to read, chock full of painstakingly researched material, presented in the author's inimitably chatty, humorous and irresistible style. I've read all his travel books (and some of his non-travel related books), so when I finally came across African Diary - which I'd heard about, never seen in a bookshop - I pounced on it. Bill Bryson's African Diary is aptly titled: it's a short (very short - even less than a hundred pages) diary of an eight-day trip to Kenya. International aid organisation CARE invited Bryson on this trip, escorted by their own staff members, to see the work they were doing in Kenya. The diary is an account of how Bryson spent a whirlwind week in Nairobi and other parts of the country - both urban and rural, seeing for himself the problems as well as the triumphs of CARE, and the people themselves. This is a quick read, not merely because it's a slim book, but also because Bryson tells his story so well, making this a mix of so many things. There are heartrending and horrifying descriptions of living conditions in the largest slum in Kenya - possibly in Africa - where there are 10 latrines for 40,000 people. There are stories, both far-fetched 'traveller's tales' and all too real ones of everything from dire poverty to crime to shocking corruption (at the time African Diary was written, Kenya was the 6th most corrupt country in the world, with $10 billion disappearing annually from public funds). Bryson writes about all of these - and also of hope, of innovations and developments that help local people stand on their own feet, and better their lot without being dependent on others. He talks about the lives of real people: of a farmer who's been pulled back from the brink, a woman entrepreneur, villagers whose lives were turned around because a well was dug. And, Bryson being the travel writer he is, there are always the brief interludes describing trips - by road, by air (a harrowing flight in a small aircraft, for example), all peppered with Bryson's superb sense of humour. I wouldn't call this Bryson's best book; it's far too short for that. By the time I really got my teeth into it and had settled in, it was over. It is, however, very readable and informative. And it's for a good cause - all proceeds from the sales of Bill Bryson's African Diary go to CARE, and towards helping those in need of that aid."

It's not like this couldn't have been longer. Bryson was in Kenya for 8 days, and he hints at a busy schedule over this time that certainly could have filled up a bit more written space. But all we get as readers is a fleeting glimpse of things. The most in-depth description of an experience has little to do with Kenya: instead it describes the harrowing landing of a small charter plane they took for one piece of the trip. The brief glimpses of Bryson's signature style bumped this into a two-star affair. But I am rating this as a book, and not as a promotional pamphlet, and for that reason I can't give it any more stars than that. There's just not enough there."

It's not quite the fast-paced fun of his other travels, but in ways a more important story, about aid to real people so they can make their own luck. And if you are looking for that Bryson flavor, do not fear, there are dangerous travels by train and air, and sound advice to poke people with something bigger than a pool cue if they claim that aid money will disappear into the pockets of corrupt politicians. And even buying this book is doing good - it all goes to support Care's efforts."

While short, it contains a lot of his trademark humour and also makes some pertinent points about what charities can and cannot achieve in third world countries. I enjoyed it."

This book reveals the most critical lessons learned over the authors' combined 30-plus years of exploring lean highways and shares stories based on real-world applications. The authors focus on areas where most lean efforts fail to illustrate steps to take to reenergize, accelerate and sustain a lean transformation. The book's ten chapters cover lean principles and thinking, lean leadership moves, the roadmap for lean transformation, common pitfalls of lean journeys, building an operating system, lean accounting, lean material management, lean in service organizations, and how individuals can apply lean to improve themselves. The book concludes with interviews of lean practitioners on the front lines of change at Chrysler, Ross Controls, DTE Energy. RSR Corporation, and Nemak.",

Brian is forced to crash-land the plane in a lake--and finds himself stranded in the remote Canadian wilderness with only his clothing and the hatchet his mother gave him as a present before his departure. Brian had been distraught over his parents' impending divorce and the secret he carries about his mother, but now he is truly desolate and alone. Exhausted, terrified, and hungry, Brian struggles to find food and make a shelter for himself. He has no special knowledge of the woods, and he must find a new kind of awareness and patience as he meets each day's challenges. Is the water safe to drink? Are the berries he finds poisonous? Slowly, Brian learns to turn adversity to his advantage--an invading porcupine unexpectedly shows him how to make fire, a devastating tornado shows him how to retrieve supplies from the submerged airplane. Most of all, Brian leaves behind the self-pity he has felt about his predicament as he summons the courage to stay alive. A story of survival and of transformation, this riveting book has sparked many a reader's interest in venturing into the wild.",

Although this story is often on middle-school reading lists, amazingly, I've never read it myself, so I thought I better rectify this. Positives: 1. I could readily empathize with Brian's wonders, fears and accomplishments; 2. being from northern Canada myself, I was quite pleased when I correctly recognized the flora and fauna Brian encountered as food sources, such as his so-called \"gutberries\" (chokecherries), \"nutbushes\" (chestnut shrubs) and \"fool birds\" (ruffed grouse); and, 3. if read aloud or freely chosen for personal reading, I could easily see older primary and upper-elementary students enjoying this survival\/adventure story. Negatives: 1. phrasing was repetitive at times and could be distracting; and, 2. Brian's encounter with the skunk was quite the head-shaker for me - even a 6-year old wouldn't have done what Brian did! As far as survival stories involving young people go, I enjoyed this one much more than Where the Crawdads Sing , because it is more realistic\/believable to me, but the book Island of the Blue Dolphins by Scott O'Dell still tops my list!"

        "text":"Hatchet is a story about a young boy (Brian) struggling to survive after his plane crashes in a forest. He was traveling by airplane from the United States to Canada to see his father when the pilot suddenly had a heart attack. Brian lands the plane, but now he’s injured--and all alone with nothing but the hatchet his mother gave him. As Brian strives to find ways to survive, he learns and adapts to the new environment, but he faces many challenges with animals and the elements. Left to survive on his instincts and what he’s learned in the past, Brian ponders over his family situation and deals with many emotions. He’s a strong boy and becomes quite resourceful, but can he survive the Canadian wilderness? Gary Paulsen is one of my favorite authors, and it all started with this book, Hatchet . This book unequivocally is a favorite from childhood, and this is probably my third or fourth time reading it in my lifetime. This story never gets old. Brian is a relatable character, and what he’s going through feels real; in fact, this book reads like nonfiction, in my opinion. It’s adventurous, engrossing, and full of suspense. Not only that, it’s thought-provoking and makes you ask questions about what you'd do in a similar situation. How prepared would you be? Do you have what it takes to survive? What’s it like to be completely alone in the wilderness? It can make your imagination run wild, and maybe that’s just one of the reasons why kids enjoy this story so much. Readers who enjoy the outdoors or those who like survival stories will likely enjoy this book. This is a middle-grade book, but I’ve read it multiple times in adulthood and have enjoyed it all the same. Something I love about this story is Brian’s perseverance and how he learns from his mistakes. There are important lessons to learn. It’s a good story for boys, but girls will likely enjoy it too. The writing makes this a quick and easy read, but the book explores death, survival, divorce, anger, and even suicidal thoughts. Hatchet is a book I would personally recommend for young readers who struggle with reading or those who don't have an interest in reading. Definitely use your own discretion on whether your reader can handle these deeper themes though. Hatchet is book #1 in the Brian’s Saga series. I’ve read them all and will read them again and again. This is a series I’d recommend to anyone. The audio by Peter Coyote is amazing and perfectly sets the tone for this book. My kids enjoyed it along with their physical copies. 4.5-stars You can also see this review @readrantrockandroll.com"

The sudden and shocking turn of events left him stunned. Realizing that crying wouldn't help, he forced himself to try and fly the plane. Somehow, he managed to land the plane in an unknown lake deep in the wilderness. Scrambling to safety, he realised his ordeal was far from over. Hunger, cold, swarms of mosquitoes, wild animals, and painful injuries were constant threats. Brian had no time to dwell on his secret; he had to survive. With only a hatchet, he was completely alone. He tried to recall all the survival skills he had learned, but practical application was much harder than he imagined. Desperate and defeated, Brian lay down and prepared to give up. But as he calmed down, he realized he had made a huge mistake. Knowledge and practice needed to be connected through thought and patience. Fear and death could be overcome with courage and confidence. And he hadn’t even truly tried. In this primitive wilderness, with no trace of modern civilization, Brian was the sole source of knowledge. He told himself he was his most valuable asset. In that moment, Brian was reborn. Brian gradually adapted to life in the wilderness and felt a sense of accomplishment he had never known before. He had endless tasks, new discoveries, and new goals. As this life became his norm, he began to miss his parents. He started to feel sorry for himself, questioning why he was so unlucky. But looking at his achievements, he realized that self-pity was pointless. Surviving was the greatest luck of all. He was grateful for the rising sun, the calm lake, and his delicious catches of fish and rabbit. However, Brian couldn't forget “the secret,” It was a secret about his parents' divorce that weighed heavily on him. If Brian taught us many life lessons, what should we as adults do? As parents, have we realized our responsibilities and obligations? But do we really have to be responsible for our children's lives? Life is full of hardships, and there are countless problems, worries, and unexpected accidents in the world. Should we tolerate, forgive, and compromise for the sake of others? A parent's love for their child is profound. This profound love means allowing children to develop independent personalities, equipping them to face various difficulties and life changes on their own, and preventing them from becoming self-destructive or losing their motivation due to temporary setbacks. A person's happiness and fulfillment are directly affected by whether their personality is complete and independent. Only when one is happy and fulfilled can they help and influence others. A truly independent and complete personality is characterized by a gradual detachment from dependence and a willingness to take responsibility for one's actions. Regardless of your marital status, teaching your children these things is a positive gift and a parental responsibility. We can leave our children money, houses, cars, and connections, which are valuable assets. However, teaching them how to use and manage these assets is the eternal way. Perhaps our children will never experience what Brian went through, but no one's life is perfect. In addition to material wealth, it is more important to provide spiritual guidance and support, and to help them apply the knowledge they have learned to practical situations as much as possible, then let them go. Teaching someone to fish can solve a lifetime of hunger. 3.4 \/ 5"

        "text":"I have to be honest. At first I was having a serious 'really?' moment as I started listening. The 'really?' was because this is a three-time Newberry Award winner, and I thought the prose was way too repetitive. The same word would be repeated three times. The same sentences twice. I was steeling myself to keep listening and hope it got better. It did. By the end of this novel, I totally realized why it is a Newberry Award winner. Hatchet is a story of survival. The protagonist is a thirteen-year-old city boy who ends up stranded in the Canadian wilderness when the pilot of the small plane he's flying in has a heart attack and dies. I have to tell you, I am very impressed with this kid. I think I would have freaked like nobody's business. He does freak out at first (and I don't blame him), but ultimately shows a fortitude that inspires awe in this reader. He goes from a scared, helpless boy to a survivor. The Brian that was has to be broken down and reassembled into a Brian that can survive his new reality. He learns how to meet his needs in the harsh wilderness, and he comes out of it forever changed. I love reading books\/watching tv shows and movies about surviving. I don't know why, really. I don't even go camping or hiking, although I love the outdoors. I think it's because I love the idea of a person being resourceful and pitting their skills and mentality against the unprejudiced, often unsympathetic wild. Not conquering it, but learning to live in harmony, becoming a part of a vast ecosystem in a way that we can't do stuck in our comfortable city and surburban environs, another entity in the web of life. I would definitely recommend this book if you are of a similar mind. I liked that Brian doesn't get it too easy. Not at all. He has to learn from his mistakes, and take the advantages that providence sends his way. He learns to keep food in his belly, to make a secure shelter, and to appreciate and anticipate the dangers of his environment. And in the process, he finds peace. He looks inside and finds his true self. That's what solitude and a oneness with nature will bring. I have always felt my most at peace in two places: in a spirit-filled church or by myself and with my heart open in prayer; and outside, surrounded by nature. So I really appreciated this aspect of the book. Brian starts out a boy who is emotionally lost at sea when his father and mother divorce, weighted down with the knowledge of his mother's infidelity; and finds that what seemed like tragedy and the end of his world will not conquer him. If he can survive the harsh elements of nature, all by himself, he can live with his family's fragmentation, and live to see the next day and the days after that. I think this book is a metaphor for life. Life is harsh and we have to grow and change to survive it. We can't give up, descend into pity, and expect to be saved. We have to be strong and fight to save ourselves, whether it's physically, mentally, or emotionally. Although this book had a very shaky start, I do have to agree that this is a winner. And I tell you what, this young man had a lot of lessons to teach me, lessons he learns the hard way. That's the power of a good fiction novel for me."

        "text":"Some books imprint themselves on your mind and stay with you. You can remember vividly where you were when you first read them. Hatchet is one of those books for me. I remember being in Mrs. Alison’s sixth grade class, and this book was raging though the male half of my class like a wildfire. Even boys who usually hated reading couldn’t put it down. Obviously, as the class’s self-proclaimed queen of the bookworms, I wanted to know what all the fuss was about. So, when a copy finally made it back to the book cubbies that lined the back of the classroom, I nabbed it. And I totally saw what the fuss was about. Survival stories have been popular for centuries. Robinson Crusoe, Kidnapped, The Swiss Family Robinson; even The Odyssey had survival aspects. So what was so special about Hatchet? It was the story of a thirteen-year-old plane-crash victim struggling to survive in the Canadian wilderness. Alone. With nothing but his hatchet. This was a main character who was close to our age. Who was struggling to accept the recent divorce of his parents, which was something that multiple kids in our class were going through, and that the rest of us feared. Who had absolutely none of the knowledge and skills seemingly necessary to make it in the wild. Like the rest of us. Seriously, what middle school kid would actually know what to do if they were dropped in the woods, alone, with no supplies and no tools except for a hatchet? If we’re honest, most of us as adults would have no clue what to do, either. One thing about kids, though; they don’t know enough yet to doubt their ability to survive anything. Kids believe that death doesn’t apply to them, and in some ways that’s the only way one could survive this type of dire situation. And survive Brian does. But Paulsen doesn’t pull punches; this is not a romanticized survival story, where food falls in the protagonist’s lap and they never get so much as a blister. Brian gets put through the wringer. This poor child get severely sunburned, violently ill from bad fruit, attacked by various forest dwellers, and more. Not to mention the near starvation he is constantly battling. As a twelve-year-old, this book was terrifying and empowering and completely enthralling. I’ve read it six more times since then, and it’s still all of those things, with a healthy dose of nostalgia thrown in. So thanks, boys in my class, for getting me interested. If you’re a parent, you should definitely get this book for your kids. If you’re still a kid at heart and have never read this, track down a copy. You never know; the things you learn from this book could save your life if you ever get stranded alone in the middle of a forest."

I love it when I am searching for an audiobook and books like this pop up as available. I think, “Ah ha! I can finally get to this one!” It did not take me long to get through Hatchet during my daily lunchtime walks. It held my interest throughout, but probably wasn’t even long enough to lose it! It is definitely geared toward pre and early teens – however, there are a couple of more difficult topics (like death and survival) that this might be a kids first introduction to (unless they are like me and started reading Stephen King at 12!) If my kids decide to try this one out, I will be there for them if they have any questions about it. Should you read this book? It is not bad for a quick read, but it may prove to be too simple for some peoples’ tastes. If you can adjust your mindset and think of it like a 10- to 13-year-old would, I think you will appreciate it more. Luckily, as I mentioned it is not very long, you are not committing too much of your time if it ends up not being your cup of tea."

Brian has to survive in the Canadian Woods on his own for a summer. He learns to make fire, shelter and hunt for fish and birds. There is also a divorce theme going on as Brian's parents have recently split. This is your typical survival tale. Brian does face some harsh environments and he learns to be tough physically and more importantly - mentally. He doesn't give in to feeling sorry for himself. This is very well written and there is a reason it is so popular. I will read more of the Brian Saga."

        "text":"Despite some of the repetition getting annoying from time to time, Hatchet is an engrossing story of survival for a young boy unfortunate enough to endure a plane crash to become stranded in the Canadian wilderness. For the most part the story sticks to realistic stuff, concentrating mainly on hunger and food. So many other survival stories focus on more, but really the basics of food and hunger and survival would be the forefront issue most would encounter if stranded alone. It sets in fast and it's almost constant. Brian shows he has what it takes to survive, but the author doesn't make the child come across as anything super since he shows that nature is uncontrollable and that it's luck of the draw for us all. The author even ends the narrative of the story saying that if Brian had been unlucky enough to be stranded during wintertime in the Canadian wilderness, he very likely wouldn't have survived at all. His dependency on the lake is the only reason he made it past the first few days, and then subsequent months, but a frozen lake would have nixed that. Although realistic with its focus on hunger and survival, it did have an unlikely tornado that felt contrived. Still the story can be forgiven this, as it focused on things like swarms of mosquitoes, baking sun, a random rude moose and other concerns. Brian didn't venture far from the landing, and I'm not sure I would have either. Some would venture far to try and find salvation themselves but he stuck to one area and stayed close to the shelter and food\/water supply that were guaranteed to be sure. A more cautious method that worked. Not sure what I would have done in his circumstances, but I see the point that the chances of shelter like that would have been few and far between. Written for children, it's more interesting and educational than upsetting. I do wish the author had spent more time granting us a deeper afterword. I realize the point of the story was the struggle, but I like to see more time involved with the after effect. Just a pet peeve of mine. We did get a small one at least. Besides the survival story being the focus, the Secret also weighed heavy in his mind, and ends up being a continuous thing he has to carry. The story ties into the Hatchet being the main tool he used to get started, but I do have to wonder why kind of random present that is that a mother gives a young boy. Either way, came in handy. Even if the repetition with the writer's style grew too much at times, it was to the point and paced well. I can see why it won so many children's awards, including Newberry Honor."

Just listened to Peter Coyote read it while riding back from Yellowstone, and loved it. Great story, well told, well read. An adventure story in part based on tough guy (with a big heart) Paulson's own survival of a plane crash and other near death experiences. When I think of that kid there finding ways to survive at a lake in Nowhere, Canada, miles from civilization, I see it precisely, I have been there, in the way of the best books. And some genuine heart-pumping moments. Paulsen's great achievement. How is it it rates only 3.61 from GR readers?!

Any ways, its a great read for an elementary kid, and everyone should read it. * This was put in quotation marks because it was a total joke. I had been looking forward to these skills for quite some time, finally girl scouts was going to teach me what I wanted! Instead of knives they handed us popsicle sticks. For the love of God CUB SCOUTS get real knives. This was followed shortly on the heels of an outdoor cooking class where none of us were allowed near the fire. Basically we made banana boats, and then the instructor put the boats in and out of the coals for us. We learned how to build a fire with coals, not tinder. Agh.

Hatchet I definitely read in middle school at the instruction of my librarian (we had a sort of once-weekly class in the library to introduce us to the already anachronistic card catalog, and maybe to encourage us to read). It strikes me now as one of those \"boy books\" and was sort of offered to me as an alternative to Babysitters' Club or Nancy Drew, maybe. It's strange now, because it undervalues literature very much to say that some is suited to boys, and others to girls (which is to say nothing of our society's pathetic need to classify and categorize). Based on my vague and unreliable memory (and the description gleaned from amazon), here are the reasons why you should have your son, nephew, homeless male orphan read Hatchet : 1) It is the story about a boy named Brian. Brian is a great boy name (maybe you've considered it for your tot?), and everything he does (probably) exudes the same brand of outdoorsy masculinity that you want your little Timmy, Tommy or Teddy to adopt as an adolescent and adult. 2) It takes place outside. What better way to encourage kids to go outside than to have them sit inside and read a book about a boy who is outside? 3) There is a hatchet, presumably. Whether little Johnny has that lumberjack vibe, or that investment banker gone Sarsgaard-murder-house vibe, certainly it will be important to introduce them to the concept of the hatchet. A very useful tool that almost no one uses, as far as I know. 4) The plot evidently features a plane crash, wherein Brian must be the lone survivor. Very likely to happen. Also, surely all the characters in this book are male, what better way to introduce your young one to a realistic view of the world than to immerse them in world dominated completely by a young boy and some owls, or something. (also see: Lord of the Flies ) 5. This 20th anniversary edition features a great commentary by the author, Gary Paulson. Even though your little brat probably won't read this (why would he?), it will give his ego the small boost for the illusion of having read a book a little longer than he actually did). 6. This is the first installation of a SAGA. For one, \"saga\" is reminiscent to me of the Nordic mythos, which seems to be the most supporting of the idealized male image. It also means there are multiple volumes following our intrepid Brian. What more could you want? Why invest in Boy Scouts when you could drop a pile of Brian books in your kid's lap and turn him into a man, while saving all that time and money? Get it! So good!"

The first thing Brain did after he crashed was he panicked, he felt lost, and he missed his family. The author described other emotions Brian felt when he was alone in the forest like hopelessness, desperation, and hunger. Every time the author expressed a feeling, it would always paint a realistic picture in my head, sometimes sending chills down my spine. I wondered “If I was in that situation, what would I do?” Although I think I would lose hope in these situations, I will get myself together and try my best to keep my self from negative emotions and hunger. It's in human nature to have a strong desire to survive. Reading this book reminded me of the movie \"The life of Pi.\" Surviving on a boat with a tiger for 227 days?! I would rather drown myself. What made Pi survive was faith. When you have faith, you have hope. When you have hope, you can see the light at the end of the tunnel. That's what motivates you to overcome difficulties and achieve your dream. Faith is what made me get up 6 o'clock in the morning to attend swimming lessons. I am still young, there will be a lot of difficulties I will be facing in my life, but I think as long as I have faith in myself, I believe I can overcome a lot of challenges and achieve my dreams."

The reason as well as the divorce itself are eating away at Brian. That is until his pilot has a heart attack and he crashes in the middle of the Canadian wilderness and has to get creative in order to survive. The book is relatively minimalist, but that in no way makes it less good. It's the story of a boy and nature and the unbreakable spirit of some people. I wish this kind of survivalist story was (still) more popular. Because neither children nor adults are generally this knowledgeable about nature anymore. Most just stand around and scream whenever anything happens. Yes, I'm one of the kids who spent a lot of time outside. I watched TV, I got a computer as a teen, my parents weren't some hippies, but I was also outside a lot and learned about making fire and finding shelter, knowing what to eat and what not when in a forest. I have colleages 10 years my senior who didn't even realize that the \"large chicken breasts\" their butcher often has aren't chicken breasts but turkey breasts and that those are two very different animals. *rolls eyes* So I really enjoyed the can-do spirit, the learning curve (that the boy was neither hysterical nor unrealistically faultless in his actions), the progression of the time spent in the wild, the Boy Scout feel of it all. I can see why so many have read this book, often in school, in the past; and why a lot of kids might dig this. It wasn't perfect, but it was a pretty neat adventure with high stakes that teaches the reader a lot about mental attitude and fortitude."

I started reading it and said, \"Damn, I hate it when authors use this kind of tone for kids, emphasizing 'secret' so damn much in extremely short and supposedly powerful ways that just sounds so faux-mysterious.\" A second later it dawned on me that I knew the rest of the story. Another second later, I realized it wasn't because the survival trope was so damn common. It was because I HAD read it and just plain forgot it. Huh. Well, anyway, it made me think about how survival tropes haven't really been around anymore. I mean, sure, we have Hunger Games and just about every Anime out there, but there's not too much in modern lit, not that I've seen. Notable examples to the contrary are Life of Pi, etc., but many of these serve as either satire or dark commentary. Whatever happened to this kind of genre, especially SF? Heinlein's juveniles used to be full of it. How odd. Oh? What about this book? lol It's fine. It made me angry and nostalgic in turn. Mostly entirely because of the Boy Scouts. I remember survival training and then I remembered that the whole thing of the BOY SCOUTS is dead now. Survival training and survival literature have both died. I think that's kinda ironic."

Although this story is often on middle-school reading lists, amazingly, I've never read it myself, so I thought I better rectify this. Positives: 1. I could readily empathize with Brian's wonders, fears and accomplishments; 2. being from northern Canada myself, I was quite pleased when I correctly recognized the flora and fauna Brian encountered as food sources, such as his so-called \"gutberries\" (chokecherries), \"nutbushes\" (chestnut shrubs) and \"fool birds\" (ruffed grouse); and, 3. if read aloud or freely chosen for personal reading, I could easily see older primary and upper-elementary students enjoying this survival\/adventure story. Negatives: 1. phrasing was repetitive at times and could be distracting; and, 2. Brian's encounter with the skunk was quite the head-shaker for me - even a 6-year old wouldn't have done what Brian did! As far as survival stories involving young people go, I enjoyed this one much more than Where the Crawdads Sing , because it is more realistic\/believable to me, but the book Island of the Blue Dolphins by Scott O'Dell still tops my list!"

        "text":"Hatchet is a story about a young boy (Brian) struggling to survive after his plane crashes in a forest. He was traveling by airplane from the United States to Canada to see his father when the pilot suddenly had a heart attack. Brian lands the plane, but now he’s injured--and all alone with nothing but the hatchet his mother gave him. As Brian strives to find ways to survive, he learns and adapts to the new environment, but he faces many challenges with animals and the elements. Left to survive on his instincts and what he’s learned in the past, Brian ponders over his family situation and deals with many emotions. He’s a strong boy and becomes quite resourceful, but can he survive the Canadian wilderness? Gary Paulsen is one of my favorite authors, and it all started with this book, Hatchet . This book unequivocally is a favorite from childhood, and this is probably my third or fourth time reading it in my lifetime. This story never gets old. Brian is a relatable character, and what he’s going through feels real; in fact, this book reads like nonfiction, in my opinion. It’s adventurous, engrossing, and full of suspense. Not only that, it’s thought-provoking and makes you ask questions about what you'd do in a similar situation. How prepared would you be? Do you have what it takes to survive? What’s it like to be completely alone in the wilderness? It can make your imagination run wild, and maybe that’s just one of the reasons why kids enjoy this story so much. Readers who enjoy the outdoors or those who like survival stories will likely enjoy this book. This is a middle-grade book, but I’ve read it multiple times in adulthood and have enjoyed it all the same. Something I love about this story is Brian’s perseverance and how he learns from his mistakes. There are important lessons to learn. It’s a good story for boys, but girls will likely enjoy it too. The writing makes this a quick and easy read, but the book explores death, survival, divorce, anger, and even suicidal thoughts. Hatchet is a book I would personally recommend for young readers who struggle with reading or those who don't have an interest in reading. Definitely use your own discretion on whether your reader can handle these deeper themes though. Hatchet is book #1 in the Brian’s Saga series. I’ve read them all and will read them again and again. This is a series I’d recommend to anyone. The audio by Peter Coyote is amazing and perfectly sets the tone for this book. My kids enjoyed it along with their physical copies. 4.5-stars You can also see this review @readrantrockandroll.com"

        "text":"13-year-old Brian, a New York boy, boarded a private plane to the northern Canadian wilderness with a heavy secret. He was going to visit his father, who worked at an oil field. While he was happy to see his father, his secret weighed heavily on his heart. As he pondered his secret, the pilot suddenly suffered a heart attack and died. The sudden and shocking turn of events left him stunned. Realizing that crying wouldn't help, he forced himself to try and fly the plane. Somehow, he managed to land the plane in an unknown lake deep in the wilderness. Scrambling to safety, he realised his ordeal was far from over. Hunger, cold, swarms of mosquitoes, wild animals, and painful injuries were constant threats. Brian had no time to dwell on his secret; he had to survive. With only a hatchet, he was completely alone. He tried to recall all the survival skills he had learned, but practical application was much harder than he imagined. Desperate and defeated, Brian lay down and prepared to give up. But as he calmed down, he realized he had made a huge mistake. Knowledge and practice needed to be connected through thought and patience. Fear and death could be overcome with courage and confidence. And he hadn’t even truly tried. In this primitive wilderness, with no trace of modern civilization, Brian was the sole source of knowledge. He told himself he was his most valuable asset. In that moment, Brian was reborn. Brian gradually adapted to life in the wilderness and felt a sense of accomplishment he had never known before. He had endless tasks, new discoveries, and new goals. As this life became his norm, he began to miss his parents. He started to feel sorry for himself, questioning why he was so unlucky. But looking at his achievements, he realized that self-pity was pointless. Surviving was the greatest luck of all. He was grateful for the rising sun, the calm lake, and his delicious catches of fish and rabbit. However, Brian couldn't forget “the secret,” It was a secret about his parents' divorce that weighed heavily on him. If Brian taught us many life lessons, what should we as adults do? As parents, have we realized our responsibilities and obligations? But do we really have to be responsible for our children's lives? Life is full of hardships, and there are countless problems, worries, and unexpected accidents in the world. Should we tolerate, forgive, and compromise for the sake of others? A parent's love for their child is profound. This profound love means allowing children to develop independent personalities, equipping them to face various difficulties and life changes on their own, and preventing them from becoming self-destructive or losing their motivation due to temporary setbacks. A person's happiness and fulfillment are directly affected by whether their personality is complete and independent. Only when one is happy and fulfilled can they help and influence others. A truly independent and complete personality is characterized by a gradual detachment from dependence and a willingness to take responsibility for one's actions. Regardless of your marital status, teaching your children these things is a positive gift and a parental responsibility. We can leave our children money, houses, cars, and connections, which are valuable assets. However, teaching them how to use and manage these assets is the eternal way. Perhaps our children will never experience what Brian went through, but no one's life is perfect. In addition to material wealth, it is more important to provide spiritual guidance and support, and to help them apply the knowledge they have learned to practical situations as much as possible, then let them go. Teaching someone to fish can solve a lifetime of hunger. 3.4 \/ 5"

        "text":"I have to be honest. At first I was having a serious 'really?' moment as I started listening. The 'really?' was because this is a three-time Newberry Award winner, and I thought the prose was way too repetitive. The same word would be repeated three times. The same sentences twice. I was steeling myself to keep listening and hope it got better. It did. By the end of this novel, I totally realized why it is a Newberry Award winner. Hatchet is a story of survival. The protagonist is a thirteen-year-old city boy who ends up stranded in the Canadian wilderness when the pilot of the small plane he's flying in has a heart attack and dies. I have to tell you, I am very impressed with this kid. I think I would have freaked like nobody's business. He does freak out at first (and I don't blame him), but ultimately shows a fortitude that inspires awe in this reader. He goes from a scared, helpless boy to a survivor. The Brian that was has to be broken down and reassembled into a Brian that can survive his new reality. He learns how to meet his needs in the harsh wilderness, and he comes out of it forever changed. I love reading books\/watching tv shows and movies about surviving. I don't know why, really. I don't even go camping or hiking, although I love the outdoors. I think it's because I love the idea of a person being resourceful and pitting their skills and mentality against the unprejudiced, often unsympathetic wild. Not conquering it, but learning to live in harmony, becoming a part of a vast ecosystem in a way that we can't do stuck in our comfortable city and surburban environs, another entity in the web of life. I would definitely recommend this book if you are of a similar mind. I liked that Brian doesn't get it too easy. Not at all. He has to learn from his mistakes, and take the advantages that providence sends his way. He learns to keep food in his belly, to make a secure shelter, and to appreciate and anticipate the dangers of his environment. And in the process, he finds peace. He looks inside and finds his true self. That's what solitude and a oneness with nature will bring. I have always felt my most at peace in two places: in a spirit-filled church or by myself and with my heart open in prayer; and outside, surrounded by nature. So I really appreciated this aspect of the book. Brian starts out a boy who is emotionally lost at sea when his father and mother divorce, weighted down with the knowledge of his mother's infidelity; and finds that what seemed like tragedy and the end of his world will not conquer him. If he can survive the harsh elements of nature, all by himself, he can live with his family's fragmentation, and live to see the next day and the days after that. I think this book is a metaphor for life. Life is harsh and we have to grow and change to survive it. We can't give up, descend into pity, and expect to be saved. We have to be strong and fight to save ourselves, whether it's physically, mentally, or emotionally. Although this book had a very shaky start, I do have to agree that this is a winner. And I tell you what, this young man had a lot of lessons to teach me, lessons he learns the hard way. That's the power of a good fiction novel for me."

        "text":"Some books imprint themselves on your mind and stay with you. You can remember vividly where you were when you first read them. Hatchet is one of those books for me. I remember being in Mrs. Alison’s sixth grade class, and this book was raging though the male half of my class like a wildfire. Even boys who usually hated reading couldn’t put it down. Obviously, as the class’s self-proclaimed queen of the bookworms, I wanted to know what all the fuss was about. So, when a copy finally made it back to the book cubbies that lined the back of the classroom, I nabbed it. And I totally saw what the fuss was about. Survival stories have been popular for centuries. Robinson Crusoe, Kidnapped, The Swiss Family Robinson; even The Odyssey had survival aspects. So what was so special about Hatchet? It was the story of a thirteen-year-old plane-crash victim struggling to survive in the Canadian wilderness. Alone. With nothing but his hatchet. This was a main character who was close to our age. Who was struggling to accept the recent divorce of his parents, which was something that multiple kids in our class were going through, and that the rest of us feared. Who had absolutely none of the knowledge and skills seemingly necessary to make it in the wild. Like the rest of us. Seriously, what middle school kid would actually know what to do if they were dropped in the woods, alone, with no supplies and no tools except for a hatchet? If we’re honest, most of us as adults would have no clue what to do, either. One thing about kids, though; they don’t know enough yet to doubt their ability to survive anything. Kids believe that death doesn’t apply to them, and in some ways that’s the only way one could survive this type of dire situation. And survive Brian does. But Paulsen doesn’t pull punches; this is not a romanticized survival story, where food falls in the protagonist’s lap and they never get so much as a blister. Brian gets put through the wringer. This poor child get severely sunburned, violently ill from bad fruit, attacked by various forest dwellers, and more. Not to mention the near starvation he is constantly battling. As a twelve-year-old, this book was terrifying and empowering and completely enthralling. I’ve read it six more times since then, and it’s still all of those things, with a healthy dose of nostalgia thrown in. So thanks, boys in my class, for getting me interested. If you’re a parent, you should definitely get this book for your kids. If you’re still a kid at heart and have never read this, track down a copy. You never know; the things you learn from this book could save your life if you ever get stranded alone in the middle of a forest."

If my kids decide to try this one out, I will be there for them if they have any questions about it. Should you read this book?

        "text":"Despite some of the repetition getting annoying from time to time, Hatchet is an engrossing story of survival for a young boy unfortunate enough to endure a plane crash to become stranded in the Canadian wilderness. For the most part the story sticks to realistic stuff, concentrating mainly on hunger and food. So many other survival stories focus on more, but really the basics of food and hunger and survival would be the forefront issue most would encounter if stranded alone. It sets in fast and it's almost constant. Brian shows he has what it takes to survive, but the author doesn't make the child come across as anything super since he shows that nature is uncontrollable and that it's luck of the draw for us all. The author even ends the narrative of the story saying that if Brian had been unlucky enough to be stranded during wintertime in the Canadian wilderness, he very likely wouldn't have survived at all. His dependency on the lake is the only reason he made it past the first few days, and then subsequent months, but a frozen lake would have nixed that. Although realistic with its focus on hunger and survival, it did have an unlikely tornado that felt contrived. Still the story can be forgiven this, as it focused on things like swarms of mosquitoes, baking sun, a random rude moose and other concerns. Brian didn't venture far from the landing, and I'm not sure I would have either. Some would venture far to try and find salvation themselves but he stuck to one area and stayed close to the shelter and food\/water supply that were guaranteed to be sure. A more cautious method that worked. Not sure what I would have done in his circumstances, but I see the point that the chances of shelter like that would have been few and far between. Written for children, it's more interesting and educational than upsetting. I do wish the author had spent more time granting us a deeper afterword. I realize the point of the story was the struggle, but I like to see more time involved with the after effect. Just a pet peeve of mine. We did get a small one at least. Besides the survival story being the focus, the Secret also weighed heavy in his mind, and ends up being a continuous thing he has to carry. The story ties into the Hatchet being the main tool he used to get started, but I do have to wonder why kind of random present that is that a mother gives a young boy. Either way, came in handy. Even if the repetition with the writer's style grew too much at times, it was to the point and paced well. I can see why it won so many children's awards, including Newberry Honor."

        "text":"I.love.this.book. Seriously, I read this maybe in fourth grade? It was definitly in elementary school, because I remember it was at the same time that we we doing \"survival skills\"* in Girl Scouts. Not that I ever wanted to be trapped by myself in the wilderness, but I spent a lot of my time in my backyard pretending to find flint with my sister, and starting imaginary fires to keep warm. In winter we dug ourselves igloos. I always went camping with my parents, so this book started a lot of Q&A's with them about what to do if I get lost in the woods (Hint, No. 1 is STAY WHERE YOU ARE!). Any ways, its a great read for an elementary kid, and everyone should read it. * This was put in quotation marks because it was a total joke. I had been looking forward to these skills for quite some time, finally girl scouts was going to teach me what I wanted! Instead of knives they handed us popsicle sticks. For the love of God CUB SCOUTS get real knives. This was followed shortly on the heels of an outdoor cooking class where none of us were allowed near the fire. Basically we made banana boats, and then the instructor put the boats in and out of the coals for us. We learned how to build a fire with coals, not tinder. Agh. It was at this point that I decided Girl Scouts was NOT for me."

I love survival stories, children without adult stories, this is quite a tough story, I err on the survival stories where you have some sort of home created, some comforting details, much appreciated because of the hardship. Brian certainly had a lot of hardship and how ironic that when he finds after 2 months of hell, a survival pack from the crash with a sleeping bag, gun, cooking stuff and copious amounts of dried food, a plane lands to rescue him before he's even had a spoonful! We began to find it amusing just how unlucky Brian managed to be! And phew! noticing this was a series of books we wondered if he would get rescued! But luckily for Brian he does! The cover on this book is a perfect example of an illustrator not reading the story, again and again we are told how Brian is weather beaten and sunburnt to a crisp, and yet the cover picture makes me think of a 1980s new romantic look complete with black eyeliner!

        "text":"So when I added this, I vaguely recalled the title, and I swear, I have definitely read it, but what I thought it was about was a boy being stuck under the snow following an avalanche (it turns out the book I was thinking of is apty named Avalanche by Arthur Roth) but anyway, that's not what it is about, and I really don't remember this book at all. Hatchet I definitely read in middle school at the instruction of my librarian (we had a sort of once-weekly class in the library to introduce us to the already anachronistic card catalog, and maybe to encourage us to read). It strikes me now as one of those \"boy books\" and was sort of offered to me as an alternative to Babysitters' Club or Nancy Drew, maybe. It's strange now, because it undervalues literature very much to say that some is suited to boys, and others to girls (which is to say nothing of our society's pathetic need to classify and categorize). Based on my vague and unreliable memory (and the description gleaned from amazon), here are the reasons why you should have your son, nephew, homeless male orphan read Hatchet : 1) It is the story about a boy named Brian. Brian is a great boy name (maybe you've considered it for your tot?), and everything he does (probably) exudes the same brand of outdoorsy masculinity that you want your little Timmy, Tommy or Teddy to adopt as an adolescent and adult. 2) It takes place outside. What better way to encourage kids to go outside than to have them sit inside and read a book about a boy who is outside? 3) There is a hatchet, presumably. Whether little Johnny has that lumberjack vibe, or that investment banker gone Sarsgaard-murder-house vibe, certainly it will be important to introduce them to the concept of the hatchet. A very useful tool that almost no one uses, as far as I know. 4) The plot evidently features a plane crash, wherein Brian must be the lone survivor. Very likely to happen. Also, surely all the characters in this book are male, what better way to introduce your young one to a realistic view of the world than to immerse them in world dominated completely by a young boy and some owls, or something. (also see: Lord of the Flies ) 5. This 20th anniversary edition features a great commentary by the author, Gary Paulson. Even though your little brat probably won't read this (why would he?), it will give his ego the small boost for the illusion of having read a book a little longer than he actually did). 6. This is the first installation of a SAGA. For one, \"saga\" is reminiscent to me of the Nordic mythos, which seems to be the most supporting of the idealized male image. It also means there are multiple volumes following our intrepid Brian. What more could you want? Why invest in Boy Scouts when you could drop a pile of Brian books in your kid's lap and turn him into a man, while saving all that time and money? Get it! So good!"

I can only guess it was because I was a huge reader even then, but I hated being told what to read; it also took time away from my other books. Reading it again, 10 years later (and again at least once a year since) it has become one of my favorites, quite possibly in my top 10.

The first thing Brain did after he crashed was he panicked, he felt lost, and he missed his family. The author described other emotions Brian felt when he was alone in the forest like hopelessness, desperation, and hunger. Every time the author expressed a feeling, it would always paint a realistic picture in my head, sometimes sending chills down my spine. I wondered “If I was in that situation, what would I do?” Although I think I would lose hope in these situations, I will get myself together and try my best to keep my self from negative emotions and hunger. It's in human nature to have a strong desire to survive. Reading this book reminded me of the movie \"The life of Pi.\" Surviving on a boat with a tiger for 227 days?! I would rather drown myself. What made Pi survive was faith. When you have faith, you have hope. When you have hope, you can see the light at the end of the tunnel. That's what motivates you to overcome difficulties and achieve your dream. Faith is what made me get up 6 o'clock in the morning to attend swimming lessons. I am still young, there will be a lot of difficulties I will be facing in my life, but I think as long as I have faith in myself, I believe I can overcome a lot of challenges and achieve my dreams."

        "text":"This was quite the treat! Young Brian is flying to Canada to visit his father during the summer after his parents have recently gotten divorced. The reason as well as the divorce itself are eating away at Brian. That is until his pilot has a heart attack and he crashes in the middle of the Canadian wilderness and has to get creative in order to survive. The book is relatively minimalist, but that in no way makes it less good. It's the story of a boy and nature and the unbreakable spirit of some people. I wish this kind of survivalist story was (still) more popular. Because neither children nor adults are generally this knowledgeable about nature anymore. Most just stand around and scream whenever anything happens. Yes, I'm one of the kids who spent a lot of time outside. I watched TV, I got a computer as a teen, my parents weren't some hippies, but I was also outside a lot and learned about making fire and finding shelter, knowing what to eat and what not when in a forest. I have colleages 10 years my senior who didn't even realize that the \"large chicken breasts\" their butcher often has aren't chicken breasts but turkey breasts and that those are two very different animals. *rolls eyes* So I really enjoyed the can-do spirit, the learning curve (that the boy was neither hysterical nor unrealistically faultless in his actions), the progression of the time spent in the wild, the Boy Scout feel of it all. I can see why so many have read this book, often in school, in the past; and why a lot of kids might dig this. It wasn't perfect, but it was a pretty neat adventure with high stakes that teaches the reader a lot about mental attitude and fortitude."

I started reading it and said, \"Damn, I hate it when authors use this kind of tone for kids, emphasizing 'secret' so damn much in extremely short and supposedly powerful ways that just sounds so faux-mysterious.\" A second later it dawned on me that I knew the rest of the story. Another second later, I realized it wasn't because the survival trope was so damn common. It was because I HAD read it and just plain forgot it. Huh. Well, anyway, it made me think about how survival tropes haven't really been around anymore. I mean, sure, we have Hunger Games and just about every Anime out there, but there's not too much in modern lit, not that I've seen. Notable examples to the contrary are Life of Pi, etc., but many of these serve as either satire or dark commentary. Whatever happened to this kind of genre, especially SF? Heinlein's juveniles used to be full of it. How odd. Oh? What about this book? lol It's fine. It made me angry and nostalgic in turn. Mostly entirely because of the Boy Scouts. I remember survival training and then I remembered that the whole thing of the BOY SCOUTS is dead now. Survival training and survival literature have both died. I think that's kinda ironic."

Although this story is often on middle-school reading lists, amazingly, I've never read it myself, so I thought I better rectify this. Positives: 1. I could readily empathize with Brian's wonders, fears and accomplishments; 2. being from northern Canada myself, I was quite pleased when I correctly recognized the flora and fauna Brian encountered as food sources, such as his so-called \"gutberries\" (chokecherries), \"nutbushes\" (chestnut shrubs) and \"fool birds\" (ruffed grouse); and, 3. if read aloud or freely chosen for personal reading, I could easily see older primary and upper-elementary students enjoying this survival\/adventure story. Negatives: 1. phrasing was repetitive at times and could be distracting; and, 2. Brian's encounter with the skunk was quite the head-shaker for me - even a 6-year old wouldn't have done what Brian did!

        "text":"Hatchet is a story about a young boy (Brian) struggling to survive after his plane crashes in a forest. He was traveling by airplane from the United States to Canada to see his father when the pilot suddenly had a heart attack. Brian lands the plane, but now he’s injured--and all alone with nothing but the hatchet his mother gave him. As Brian strives to find ways to survive, he learns and adapts to the new environment, but he faces many challenges with animals and the elements. Left to survive on his instincts and what he’s learned in the past, Brian ponders over his family situation and deals with many emotions. He’s a strong boy and becomes quite resourceful, but can he survive the Canadian wilderness? Gary Paulsen is one of my favorite authors, and it all started with this book, Hatchet . This book unequivocally is a favorite from childhood, and this is probably my third or fourth time reading it in my lifetime. This story never gets old. Brian is a relatable character, and what he’s going through feels real; in fact, this book reads like nonfiction, in my opinion. It’s adventurous, engrossing, and full of suspense. Not only that, it’s thought-provoking and makes you ask questions about what you'd do in a similar situation. How prepared would you be? Do you have what it takes to survive? What’s it like to be completely alone in the wilderness? It can make your imagination run wild, and maybe that’s just one of the reasons why kids enjoy this story so much. Readers who enjoy the outdoors or those who like survival stories will likely enjoy this book. This is a middle-grade book, but I’ve read it multiple times in adulthood and have enjoyed it all the same. Something I love about this story is Brian’s perseverance and how he learns from his mistakes. There are important lessons to learn. It’s a good story for boys, but girls will likely enjoy it too. The writing makes this a quick and easy read, but the book explores death, survival, divorce, anger, and even suicidal thoughts. Hatchet is a book I would personally recommend for young readers who struggle with reading or those who don't have an interest in reading. Definitely use your own discretion on whether your reader can handle these deeper themes though. Hatchet is book #1 in the Brian’s Saga series. I’ve read them all and will read them again and again. This is a series I’d recommend to anyone. The audio by Peter Coyote is amazing and perfectly sets the tone for this book. My kids enjoyed it along with their physical copies. 4.5-stars You can also see this review @readrantrockandroll.com"

While he was happy to see his father, his secret weighed heavily on his heart. As he pondered his secret, the pilot suddenly suffered a heart attack and died. The sudden and shocking turn of events left him stunned. Realizing that crying wouldn't help, he forced himself to try and fly the plane. Somehow, he managed to land the plane in an unknown lake deep in the wilderness. Scrambling to safety, he realised his ordeal was far from over. Hunger, cold, swarms of mosquitoes, wild animals, and painful injuries were constant threats. Brian had no time to dwell on his secret; he had to survive. With only a hatchet, he was completely alone. He tried to recall all the survival skills he had learned, but practical application was much harder than he imagined. Desperate and defeated, Brian lay down and prepared to give up. But as he calmed down, he realized he had made a huge mistake. Knowledge and practice needed to be connected through thought and patience. Fear and death could be overcome with courage and confidence. And he hadn’t even truly tried. In this primitive wilderness, with no trace of modern civilization, Brian was the sole source of knowledge. He told himself he was his most valuable asset. In that moment, Brian was reborn. Brian gradually adapted to life in the wilderness and felt a sense of accomplishment he had never known before. He had endless tasks, new discoveries, and new goals. As this life became his norm, he began to miss his parents. He started to feel sorry for himself, questioning why he was so unlucky. But looking at his achievements, he realized that self-pity was pointless. Surviving was the greatest luck of all. He was grateful for the rising sun, the calm lake, and his delicious catches of fish and rabbit. However, Brian couldn't forget “the secret,” It was a secret about his parents' divorce that weighed heavily on him. If Brian taught us many life lessons, what should we as adults do? As parents, have we realized our responsibilities and obligations? But do we really have to be responsible for our children's lives? Life is full of hardships, and there are countless problems, worries, and unexpected accidents in the world. Should we tolerate, forgive, and compromise for the sake of others? A parent's love for their child is profound. This profound love means allowing children to develop independent personalities, equipping them to face various difficulties and life changes on their own, and preventing them from becoming self-destructive or losing their motivation due to temporary setbacks. A person's happiness and fulfillment are directly affected by whether their personality is complete and independent. Only when one is happy and fulfilled can they help and influence others. A truly independent and complete personality is characterized by a gradual detachment from dependence and a willingness to take responsibility for one's actions. Regardless of your marital status, teaching your children these things is a positive gift and a parental responsibility. We can leave our children money, houses, cars, and connections, which are valuable assets. However, teaching them how to use and manage these assets is the eternal way. Perhaps our children will never experience what Brian went through, but no one's life is perfect. In addition to material wealth, it is more important to provide spiritual guidance and support, and to help them apply the knowledge they have learned to practical situations as much as possible, then let them go. Teaching someone to fish can solve a lifetime of hunger. 3.4 \/ 5"

The 'really?' was because this is a three-time Newberry Award winner, and I thought the prose was way too repetitive. The same word would be repeated three times. The same sentences twice. I was steeling myself to keep listening and hope it got better. It did. By the end of this novel, I totally realized why it is a Newberry Award winner. Hatchet is a story of survival. The protagonist is a thirteen-year-old city boy who ends up stranded in the Canadian wilderness when the pilot of the small plane he's flying in has a heart attack and dies. I have to tell you, I am very impressed with this kid. I think I would have freaked like nobody's business. He does freak out at first (and I don't blame him), but ultimately shows a fortitude that inspires awe in this reader. He goes from a scared, helpless boy to a survivor. The Brian that was has to be broken down and reassembled into a Brian that can survive his new reality. He learns how to meet his needs in the harsh wilderness, and he comes out of it forever changed. I love reading books\/watching tv shows and movies about surviving. I don't know why, really. I don't even go camping or hiking, although I love the outdoors. I think it's because I love the idea of a person being resourceful and pitting their skills and mentality against the unprejudiced, often unsympathetic wild. Not conquering it, but learning to live in harmony, becoming a part of a vast ecosystem in a way that we can't do stuck in our comfortable city and surburban environs, another entity in the web of life. I would definitely recommend this book if you are of a similar mind. I liked that Brian doesn't get it too easy. Not at all. He has to learn from his mistakes, and take the advantages that providence sends his way. He learns to keep food in his belly, to make a secure shelter, and to appreciate and anticipate the dangers of his environment. And in the process, he finds peace. He looks inside and finds his true self. That's what solitude and a oneness with nature will bring. I have always felt my most at peace in two places: in a spirit-filled church or by myself and with my heart open in prayer; and outside, surrounded by nature. So I really appreciated this aspect of the book. Brian starts out a boy who is emotionally lost at sea when his father and mother divorce, weighted down with the knowledge of his mother's infidelity; and finds that what seemed like tragedy and the end of his world will not conquer him. If he can survive the harsh elements of nature, all by himself, he can live with his family's fragmentation, and live to see the next day and the days after that. I think this book is a metaphor for life. Life is harsh and we have to grow and change to survive it. We can't give up, descend into pity, and expect to be saved. We have to be strong and fight to save ourselves, whether it's physically, mentally, or emotionally. Although this book had a very shaky start, I do have to agree that this is a winner. And I tell you what, this young man had a lot of lessons to teach me, lessons he learns the hard way. That's the power of a good fiction novel for me."

        "text":"Some books imprint themselves on your mind and stay with you. You can remember vividly where you were when you first read them. Hatchet is one of those books for me. I remember being in Mrs. Alison’s sixth grade class, and this book was raging though the male half of my class like a wildfire. Even boys who usually hated reading couldn’t put it down. Obviously, as the class’s self-proclaimed queen of the bookworms, I wanted to know what all the fuss was about. So, when a copy finally made it back to the book cubbies that lined the back of the classroom, I nabbed it. And I totally saw what the fuss was about. Survival stories have been popular for centuries. Robinson Crusoe, Kidnapped, The Swiss Family Robinson; even The Odyssey had survival aspects. So what was so special about Hatchet? It was the story of a thirteen-year-old plane-crash victim struggling to survive in the Canadian wilderness. Alone. With nothing but his hatchet. This was a main character who was close to our age. Who was struggling to accept the recent divorce of his parents, which was something that multiple kids in our class were going through, and that the rest of us feared. Who had absolutely none of the knowledge and skills seemingly necessary to make it in the wild. Like the rest of us. Seriously, what middle school kid would actually know what to do if they were dropped in the woods, alone, with no supplies and no tools except for a hatchet? If we’re honest, most of us as adults would have no clue what to do, either. One thing about kids, though; they don’t know enough yet to doubt their ability to survive anything. Kids believe that death doesn’t apply to them, and in some ways that’s the only way one could survive this type of dire situation. And survive Brian does. But Paulsen doesn’t pull punches; this is not a romanticized survival story, where food falls in the protagonist’s lap and they never get so much as a blister. Brian gets put through the wringer. This poor child get severely sunburned, violently ill from bad fruit, attacked by various forest dwellers, and more. Not to mention the near starvation he is constantly battling. As a twelve-year-old, this book was terrifying and empowering and completely enthralling. I’ve read it six more times since then, and it’s still all of those things, with a healthy dose of nostalgia thrown in. So thanks, boys in my class, for getting me interested. If you’re a parent, you should definitely get this book for your kids. If you’re still a kid at heart and have never read this, track down a copy. You never know; the things you learn from this book could save your life if you ever get stranded alone in the middle of a forest."

I love it when I am searching for an audiobook and books like this pop up as available. I think, “Ah ha! I can finally get to this one!” It did not take me long to get through Hatchet during my daily lunchtime walks. It held my interest throughout, but probably wasn’t even long enough to lose it! It is definitely geared toward pre and early teens – however, there are a couple of more difficult topics (like death and survival) that this might be a kids first introduction to (unless they are like me and started reading Stephen King at 12!) If my kids decide to try this one out, I will be there for them if they have any questions about it. Should you read this book? It is not bad for a quick read, but it may prove to be too simple for some peoples’ tastes. If you can adjust your mindset and think of it like a 10- to 13-year-old would, I think you will appreciate it more.

Brian has to survive in the Canadian Woods on his own for a summer. He learns to make fire, shelter and hunt for fish and birds. There is also a divorce theme going on as Brian's parents have recently split. This is your typical survival tale. Brian does face some harsh environments and he learns to be tough physically and more importantly - mentally. He doesn't give in to feeling sorry for himself. This is very well written and there is a reason it is so popular. I will read more of the Brian Saga."

        "text":"Despite some of the repetition getting annoying from time to time, Hatchet is an engrossing story of survival for a young boy unfortunate enough to endure a plane crash to become stranded in the Canadian wilderness. For the most part the story sticks to realistic stuff, concentrating mainly on hunger and food. So many other survival stories focus on more, but really the basics of food and hunger and survival would be the forefront issue most would encounter if stranded alone. It sets in fast and it's almost constant. Brian shows he has what it takes to survive, but the author doesn't make the child come across as anything super since he shows that nature is uncontrollable and that it's luck of the draw for us all. The author even ends the narrative of the story saying that if Brian had been unlucky enough to be stranded during wintertime in the Canadian wilderness, he very likely wouldn't have survived at all. His dependency on the lake is the only reason he made it past the first few days, and then subsequent months, but a frozen lake would have nixed that. Although realistic with its focus on hunger and survival, it did have an unlikely tornado that felt contrived. Still the story can be forgiven this, as it focused on things like swarms of mosquitoes, baking sun, a random rude moose and other concerns. Brian didn't venture far from the landing, and I'm not sure I would have either. Some would venture far to try and find salvation themselves but he stuck to one area and stayed close to the shelter and food\/water supply that were guaranteed to be sure. A more cautious method that worked. Not sure what I would have done in his circumstances, but I see the point that the chances of shelter like that would have been few and far between. Written for children, it's more interesting and educational than upsetting. I do wish the author had spent more time granting us a deeper afterword. I realize the point of the story was the struggle, but I like to see more time involved with the after effect. Just a pet peeve of mine. We did get a small one at least. Besides the survival story being the focus, the Secret also weighed heavy in his mind, and ends up being a continuous thing he has to carry. The story ties into the Hatchet being the main tool he used to get started, but I do have to wonder why kind of random present that is that a mother gives a young boy. Either way, came in handy. Even if the repetition with the writer's style grew too much at times, it was to the point and paced well. I can see why it won so many children's awards, including Newberry Honor."

Just listened to Peter Coyote read it while riding back from Yellowstone, and loved it. Great story, well told, well read. An adventure story in part based on tough guy (with a big heart) Paulson's own survival of a plane crash and other near death experiences. When I think of that kid there finding ways to survive at a lake in Nowhere, Canada, miles from civilization, I see it precisely, I have been there, in the way of the best books. And some genuine heart-pumping moments. Paulsen's great achievement. How is it it rates only 3.61 from GR readers?!

For the love of God CUB SCOUTS get real knives. This was followed shortly on the heels of an outdoor cooking class where none of us were allowed near the fire.

Hatchet I definitely read in middle school at the instruction of my librarian (we had a sort of once-weekly class in the library to introduce us to the already anachronistic card catalog, and maybe to encourage us to read). It strikes me now as one of those \"boy books\" and was sort of offered to me as an alternative to Babysitters' Club or Nancy Drew, maybe. It's strange now, because it undervalues literature very much to say that some is suited to boys, and others to girls (which is to say nothing of our society's pathetic need to classify and categorize). Based on my vague and unreliable memory (and the description gleaned from amazon), here are the reasons why you should have your son, nephew, homeless male orphan read Hatchet : 1) It is the story about a boy named Brian. Brian is a great boy name (maybe you've considered it for your tot?), and everything he does (probably) exudes the same brand of outdoorsy masculinity that you want your little Timmy, Tommy or Teddy to adopt as an adolescent and adult. 2) It takes place outside. What better way to encourage kids to go outside than to have them sit inside and read a book about a boy who is outside? 3) There is a hatchet, presumably. Whether little Johnny has that lumberjack vibe, or that investment banker gone Sarsgaard-murder-house vibe, certainly it will be important to introduce them to the concept of the hatchet. A very useful tool that almost no one uses, as far as I know. 4) The plot evidently features a plane crash, wherein Brian must be the lone survivor. Very likely to happen. Also, surely all the characters in this book are male, what better way to introduce your young one to a realistic view of the world than to immerse them in world dominated completely by a young boy and some owls, or something. (also see: Lord of the Flies ) 5. This 20th anniversary edition features a great commentary by the author, Gary Paulson. Even though your little brat probably won't read this (why would he?), it will give his ego the small boost for the illusion of having read a book a little longer than he actually did). 6. This is the first installation of a SAGA. For one, \"saga\" is reminiscent to me of the Nordic mythos, which seems to be the most supporting of the idealized male image. It also means there are multiple volumes following our intrepid Brian. What more could you want? Why invest in Boy Scouts when you could drop a pile of Brian books in your kid's lap and turn him into a man, while saving all that time and money? Get it! So good!"

Every time the author expressed a feeling, it would always paint a realistic picture in my head, sometimes sending chills down my spine. I wondered “If I was in that situation, what would I do?” Although I think I would lose hope in these situations, I will get myself together and try my best to keep my self from negative emotions and hunger. It's in human nature to have a strong desire to survive. Reading this book reminded me of the movie \"The life of Pi.\" Surviving on a boat with a tiger for 227 days?! I would rather drown myself. What made Pi survive was faith. When you have faith, you have hope. When you have hope, you can see the light at the end of the tunnel. That's what motivates you to overcome difficulties and achieve your dream. Faith is what made me get up 6 o'clock in the morning to attend swimming lessons.

The reason as well as the divorce itself are eating away at Brian.

The book is relatively minimalist, but that in no way makes it less good. It's the story of a boy and nature and the unbreakable spirit of some people. I wish this kind of survivalist story was (still) more popular. Because neither children nor adults are generally this knowledgeable about nature anymore. Most just stand around and scream whenever anything happens. Yes, I'm one of the kids who spent a lot of time outside. I watched TV, I got a computer as a teen, my parents weren't some hippies, but I was also outside a lot and learned about making fire and finding shelter, knowing what to eat and what not when in a forest. I have colleages 10 years my senior who didn't even realize that the \"large chicken breasts\" their butcher often has aren't chicken breasts but turkey breasts and that those are two very different animals. *rolls eyes* So I really enjoyed the can-do spirit, the learning curve (that the boy was neither hysterical nor unrealistically faultless in his actions), the progression of the time spent in the wild, the Boy Scout feel of it all. I can see why so many have read this book, often in school, in the past; and why a lot of kids might dig this.

        "text":"The one thing that bothered me the most about this book was a huge error it had on swearwords, in reference to my mother tongue Finnish: (p. 210, Ch. Swearing, in my Penguin paperback:) “Some cultures don’t swear at all. (…) The Finns, lacking the sort of words you need to describe your feelings when you stub your toe getting up to answer a phone at 2.00 a.m., rather oddly adopted the word “ravintolassa.” It means ‘in the restaurant.’\" I mean, what the hell?! We Finns have probably the world's most colourful collection of swearwords. Someone pulled old Bill's leg, and did it properly too. That casts doubt on all he has written, really. And nobody says \"ravintolassa\" unless they do in fact mean \"in the restaurant.\""

        "text":"“To be fair, English is full of booby traps for the unwary foreigner. Any language where the unassuming word fly signifies an annoying insect, a means of travel, and a critical part of a gentleman’s apparel is clearly asking to be mangled.” Say what you want, Bill Bryson, but English is actually ridiculously easy. Not that I’m perfect in it, but still, compared to other languages, it’s a piece of cake. Even with those pesky indefinite and definite articles — I’ll still take those over conjugations and declensions and all that other stuff English seems to have just shrugged off to everyone’s benefit. The spelling — well, if seven-year-old Nataliya was able to get past the sheer mortification of spelling “cat” as “kat” in her first English class in school, so can everyone else. “Language, never forget, is more fashion than science, and matters of usage, spelling, and pronunciation tend to wander around like hemlines.” Languages evolve naturally, sometimes slowly and sometimes unexpectedly fast, with everything contributing to that, even misspellings and misunderstandings. Spelling can follow pronunciation, but then we also have pronunciation change due to new spelling fads (like adding “t” to “often” and “b” to “debt”). The origins of English are basically a mishmash of so many influences, and I never get tired of all the anecdotes and Bryson-style tangents. What I love is that Bryson is not a self-appointed grammarian and is quite clear about his views on the completely arbitrary grammar conventions that have no basis whatsoever other than some stuffy pedant deciding on a way to separate the elite from the plebs. After all, “Considerations of what makes for good English or bad English are to an uncomfortably large extent matters of prejudice and conditioning.” “So if there are no officially appointed guardians for the English language, who sets down all those rules that we all know about from childhood—the idea that we must never end a sentence with a preposition or begin one with a conjunction, that we must use each other for two things and one another for more than two, and that we must never use hopefully in an absolute sense, such as “Hopefully it will not rain tomorrow”? The answer, surprisingly often, is that no one does, that when you look into the background of these “rules” there is often little basis for them.” And so I will happily go on starting my sentences with “And…” and ending them with prepositions while splitting every infinitive I can possibly find. “I can think of two very good reasons for not splitting an infinitive. 1. Because you feel that the rules of English ought to conform to the grammatical precepts of a language that died a thousand years ago. 2. Because you wish to cling to a pointless affectation of usage that is without the support of any recognized authority of the last 200 years, even at the cost of composing sentences that are ambiguous, inelegant, and patently contorted.” Image borrowed from The Jenkins comic strip here: https:\/\/thejenkinscomic.wordpress.com... . I do adore reading about British and American English differences — hey, our linguistic peculiarities here in the US are because we held on to saying things like “gotten” that the Brits have since forgotten. We are charming this way, I suppose. (And those poor 18th century public US figures had to dejectedly apologize to those Brits about Americanisms. Hey, without us you’d still be using “gyratory circuses” instead of roundabouts. But sadly, despite what we’d love to think, Shakespeare - or perhaps Shakspere - did not sound like an Appalachian farmer). “Sometimes these differences in meaning take on a kind of bewildering circularity. A tramp in Britain is a bum in America, while a bum in Britain is a fanny in America, while a fanny in Britain is—well, we’ve covered that. To a foreigner it must seem sometimes as if we are being intentionally contrary.” ———— Arguably America’s single greatest gift to international discourse, O.K. is the most grammatically versatile of words, able to serve as an adjective (“Lunch was O.K.”), verb (“Can you O.K. this for me?”), noun (“I need your O.K. on this”), interjection (“O.K., I hear you”), and adverb (“We did O.K.”). It can carry shades of meaning that range from casual assent (“Shall we go?” “O.K.”), to great enthusiasm (“O.K.!”), to lukewarm endorsement (“The party was O.K.”), to a more or less meaningless filler of space (“O.K., can I have your attention please?”). Bill Bryson is funny and very enthusiastic, sometimes overwhelmingly so, but it’s very endearing. This book is not a scholarly work by any means but rather a bunch of anecdotes told in such a manner that you just can’t stop reading (or listening on a few long hikes in my case). I’m a sucker for such enthusiastic sincere humor, so it was right up my alley. And even though some things are clearly a bit dated in information and attitudes (the book was published in 1990), it didn't spoil the experience for me. “Perhaps for our last words on the subject of usage we should turn to the last words of the venerable French grammarian Dominique Bonhours, who proved on his deathbed that a grammarian’s work is never done when he turned to those gathered loyally around him and whispered: “I am about to—or I am going to—die; either expression is used.” For a more scholarly approach I do highly advise reading David Crystal ’s books, which I do plan to reread, actually, but for a fun diversion for a few hours Bryson is good. 3.5 stars."

        "text":"I know exactly a little bit about English, and a little bit less about linguistics in general. Studied a few foreign languages, took a linguistics class or two in college. I'm what you might call a big fan of language. A dabbler. Certainly not an expert. But boy, did I find this book infuriating. My problem with this book is that it gets so much right, and so much wrong. The example that really set me off was his treatment of the Welsh language. To Bryson, Welsh is \"as unpronounceable as it looks\", and Welsh pronunciations \"rarely bear much relation to their spellings.\" He then spouts off with a series of jokes that are so ethnocentric and condescending that, if you took them at face value, you couldn't help but feel sorry for the poor backward speakers of silly old Welsh. The problem is, he's completely wrong. I happened to study the phonology and orthography of Welsh for about a week in that freshman linguistics class (I know, that makes me a big authority, right?) but in that week I learned something Bryson apparently never bothered to look up: Welsh orthography is remarkably regular, about as regular as Spanish. It's not at all difficult if you bother to learn the rules, which are far simpler than those of English. (The fact that I learned them in one week, and remember them decades later, should be some indication of how easy they are.) The phoneme represented by the double-l is called a lateral fricative, and yes, it's hard to pronounce if you don't speak Welsh, but that does not mean it's sometimes pronounced \"kl\" and other times \"thl\" as Bryson suggests. It is always pronounced just like it's spelled. But Bryson's Anglo-American tin ear failed to pick that up, and he took his ignorance and turned it into a cheap joke at another culture's expense. Knowing that he got Welsh so wrong made me doubt all of the rest of the information in the book. And that's a real shame, because it covers such fascinating topics, and it's so very entertainingly written. But it's hard to enjoy Bryson's jokes when you have this nagging suspicion that he's bending the truth for the sake of a snappy punchline."

So, Bill Bryson + cheap equals insta-buy for me, apparently. Too bad even Bill Bryson couldn't make this terribly entertaining. I have a long history as \"the obscure facts guy\" at social gatherings, at least, I did when people still invited me to such things. However, even I had trouble sticking with this one at times. Old Bill is in fine form, cracking wise and still being informative at every opportunity. He didn't get much in the way of interesting material to work with in this case. The book was not without its moments, however. I did enjoy the chapter on swearing, as well as numerous tidbits, or titbits, as they were called in a less prudish era, that peppered the other chapters. Too bad the gems were scarce and some of the reading resembled the back-breaking labor involved in mining. While I found the book informative and mildly amusing, at the end of the day, it's still a book about the history of words. Even one of the funnier travel writers alive can't make chicken salad from chicken feathers in this case. 2.5 out of 5."

        "text":"Ever since I learned to read, English has been my favourite language - I took to it like a duck takes to water (at least, I guess they take to it willingly, and that baby ducks are not paddled until their feathers fly by Mamma Duck to make them). This was the cause of the eternal chagrin of my mother who, being a staunch nationalist, wanted me to prefer Hindi over English. She recited to me a famous couplet in Malayalam, which said: \"Other languages are merely nannies; For man, the native tongue is the mother.\" I replied that in that case, Malayalam is my mother, and both Hindi and English are nannies. And I just happened to prefer my English nanny over my native one. She had no answer to that! Well, I am glad I stuck to English over Hindi, because this is one crazy nanny - totally idiosyncratic and eccentric, just like me. And to tell you how eccentric, who better than Bill Bryson? If you approach this book hoping for a scholarly analysis of the English language, you are going to be sorely disappointed. For that don't come to old Bill. What he does is to throw out titbits (or tidbits in the US, as they the consider the former spelling risque - so Bryson tells me) of information, some useful, some useless, some bizarre: but all fascinating. One thing you can be sure of - you won't be disappointed. This book is a linguistic, historical and geographical romp through English wherein Bill tackles such varied subjects as 1. The origin and spread of English 2. The evolution of words 3. Pronunciation 4. Spelling 5. The varieties of English, both inside the UK and outside 6. Dictionaries and their producers 7. Where names come from 8. Profanity 9. Wordplay ... and much more. There is not a single boring sentence. You are guaranteed to be snickering throughout."

        "text":"1★ (DNF) I thought this would be fun. I love words and languages and have a passing interest in linguistics. I started this with enthusiasm and was enjoying his breezy style until it occurred to me that a lot of what he was saying seemed to be anecdotal. You know, limited or no research. Then I thought, well, it was written more than 25 years ago, so things that sounded like old stories to me may have been new stories then – like this one: “The Eskimos, as is well known, have fifty words for types of snow—though curiously no word for just plain snow. To them there is crunchy snow, soft snow, fresh snow, and old snow, but no word that just means snow.” There’s a wealth of articles about this half-truth (I’m being generous). Here’s one http:\/\/www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca... So how many grains of salt would I need to swallow the declaration that immediately followed? An unhealthy amount, I’m sure. “The Italians, as we might expect, have over 500 names for different types of macaroni.” He goes on to say these include “spaghetti and vermicelli.” He obviously means types of pasta . Then he got into some languages I have a smattering of myself – French and German—and I began questioning. Some of it just sounded wrong, like the quote from an article that says most speakers of other languages aren’t aware there is such a thing as a thesaurus. At this point, I decided I’d read some reviews to see if anyone who knows more than I do felt the same way. Sadly, there are a lot. You can check the low-rating reviews on Amazon that actually discuss the many factual errors. I stopped reading, thinking I might accidentally absorb some of the \"facts\" and perpetuate them myself! How disappointing. One star for the writing."

        "text":"November 2021: Went ahead and removed my 4 star rating for this book, which I read and reviewed in 2006. It has since been pointed out, repeatedly, that Bryson is wrong in a staggering number of places in this book, and as I went on to read more of his work, I also realized exactly how racist he is. I don't read or recommend his books anymore. Here's my original review from 2006, preserved as an artifact of how I was wrong: Published in 1990, this book is already a little out of date. In its first pages, Bryson reports OED editor Robert Burchfield's theory that American English and British English are drifting apart so rapidly that within two hundred years we won't be able to understand each other. That was a theory made back when cell phones still required a battery the size of an unabridged dictionary, long before the internet became such a large part of the way the world communicates, in a time when you couldn't imagine downloading a British Doctor Who or an American Stargate Atlantis to your iPod. We live in a new world! Unfortunately it's also a world where the Harry Potter books are \"translated\" for American readers, lest we be too confused by the lingo: \"What's this? Harry's eating a biscuit? And wearing a jumper? While battling Fizzolian Snargletoothed Whatsits?! This book is impenetrable!\" JK Rowling aside, with communication technology becoming smaller, cheaper, and more powerful, I think we'll still be able to communicate two hundred years down the line. Bryson eventually disagrees with Burchfield for many of the same reasons, though he was unable to cite the internet as a factor. In that way, this book is showing its age -- the chapter on online language use is, of course, conspicuously absent -- but it's got the history part down. Bryson spends most of his time looking at how we got where we are today. Where English came from, how it got to England, where it went from there. With its in-text references, footnotes, extensive bibliography and index, this book looks almost academic, but Bryson, an American living in England, handles it all with a cheerfully low-key sense of humor -- almost as if Terry Pratchett had turned his eye to grammar -- and even a refreshingly open approach to the word fuck in the chapter on swearing. My one complaint is that, despite being loosely hung on British and American history, for the most part the book lacks a greater structure and ends up reading like a series of interesting facts. But, hell, they got my attention, and, as it happened, the attention of everyone around me: \"Hey! Did you know the Romans had no word for grey ?\" Since English, as this book proves, is a big crazy mess, I guess Bryson can be excused for not being able to wrangle its history into a more pleasing order. Lack of structure aside, I really enjoyed reading this and will be reading more books by Bryson in the future."

For example claiming that the German preposition\/suffix \"auf\" is unusual among foreign words in that it has more than one meaning... anyone who has spent any time learning a language will tell you that all of them have words with dozens of meanings (Except maybe Esperanto?). Furthermore there is no preposition in any language that cannot be translated into at least three or four prepositions in English, nor are there any English prepositions that don't have numerous translations in the other language. That's just how prepositions are! They don't translate! The first chapter of this book has so many mistakes that I couldn't finish it. Almost every sentence has a mistake. It is a collage of newspaper clippings. If you read the credits at the back you'll see that he only consulted newspapers and magazines and did no real research. I can't go through all the mistakes, I really don't have the time, there are just too many. If it continues in this way then this is a work of complete and utter fiction. I loved \"A Short History of Nearly Everything\" and now I am frightened that if I knew anything whatsoever about \"Everything\" I would have found that that book too was filled with amusing but completely made up factoids."

The subject matter is not that hard, so I can only guess \"The Mother Tongue\" was written in such a hurry that you only consulted one or two sources, where it should have been five or six. The history of English is not something you learn from reading one textbook; there is a lot of ongoing research and debate. And most of your sources are a decade or two out of date, even for 1991. Get your facts straight and publish a revised edition is the best advice I can give you. And as for my fellow readers: buy David Crystal's The Stories of English instead. Far better researched and just as entertaining."

        "text":"I'm a longtime fan of Bill Bryson, but I had never read this early nonfiction work of his and was delighted to see that my library had a copy of the audiobook. \"The Mother Tongue\" has the expected rambling charm of a Bryson nonfiction work. When he becomes enamored on a topic (such as the history of our houses in \"At Home\" or the history of our universe in \"A Short History of Nearly Everything\") Bryson digs up all kinds of interesting facts and stories and anecdotes and puts it all together in a delightfully interesting collection of essays. In this book, he discusses the history of the English language, but also the history of languages in general, the history of dictionaries, and many of the odd pronunciations and spellings that are so peculiar to English. Knowing that \"The Mother Tongue\" was published in 1990, I had fun imagining what additions Bryson would have added to the text today, knowing how many new words have been adopted since the Internet took over our world. Overall, this was a pleasant read and is a nice complement to other books that have been written about the English language. Recommended. Opening Passage \"More than 300 million people in the world speak English and the rest, it sometimes seems, try to. It would be charitable to say that the results are sometimes mixed. Consider this hearty announcement in a Yugoslavian hotel: 'The flattening of underwear with pleasure is the job of the chambermaid. Turn to her straightaway.' Or this warning to motorists in Tokyo: 'When a passenger of the foot heave in sight, tootle the horn. Trumpet at him melodiously at first, but if he still obstacles your passage, then tootle him with vigor.' Or these instructions gracing a packet of convenience food from Italy: 'Besmear a backing pan, previously buttered with a good tomato sauce, and, after dispose the cannelloni, lightly distanced between them in a only couch.' Clearly the writer of that message was not about to let a little ignorance of English stand in the way of a good meal. In fact, it would appear that one of the beauties of the English language is that even with the most tenuous grasp you can speak volumes if you show enough enthusiasm — a willingness to tootle with vigor, as it were.\""

Published in 1990, the book was written before Internet changed the way the world communicates and hence a lot of the content regarding the spread of languages is hopelessly outdated by now. Bryson is not a linguist, neither is he a historian. Therefore his attempts to explain the popularity and status of English as the lingua franca of the modern world come off haphazard at best. Bryson's love for his native English is clear enough; so is his painfully obvious lack of knowledge of any other languages. I did not care to keep count of the times he falsely asserts some feature in English cannot be found in any other language or blatantly moves the goalposts to prove how infinitely richer English is compared to anything. For all the little anecdotes and copious bits of trivia it contains, I really want to like the book more than I do. Unfortunately once it becomes clear that many of these factoids won't stand up to closer scrutiny -- Bryson doesn't even blink as he repeats the age-old and very disputed claim that the Eskimos have 50 words for snow -- it becomes hard to believe anything the book claims. The most baffling and outrageous claim of all is the one that strikes closest to home. Bryson has the audacity to suggest we Finns have no native swear words and use the phrase \"in the restaurant\" as a curse instead. Perkele, I say."

However, I for one have generally and usually found Bryson’s general tone of narrational voice and the boastful, arrogant demeanour he constantly seems to present and yes indeed often downright spew in The Mother Tongue: English and How it Got that Way extremely off-putting and really at best massively condescending, with his claims regarding the supposed superiority of the English language both unacademic and yes, profoundly bigoted and stereotyping (and as such of course absolutely devoid of any kind of linguistic acumen and actual bona fide language based knowledge). And albeit granted that English is at present a so-called and even aptly labelled world language, the reasons why English is such, the reasons why English is so profoundly popular and globally strong at present are NOT (at least in in my humble opinion) due to any type of linguistic superiority, they are primarily and simply cultural and historic in nature and also have much to do with economics and not with English being in any manner a better and superior language linguistically speaking than French, German, Chinese, Russian and so on and so on. And quite frankly, Mr. Bryson (and if you are perhaps offended by this, sorry, but I really and truly care not), your considerations about English and that you somehow think and assume the language is somehow better, is supposedly more advanced and of higher quality than other languages, this attitude truly makes me as a person of German background cringe profoundly, as it so strongly and uncomfortably does tend to remind me of the type of rhetoric that was used in the Third Reich by Adolf Hitler and his ilk to claim and attempt to demonstrate that German (that the Germanic languages) were supposedly both linguistically and genetically superior and more advanced than other language groups and families. However, languages are simply languages and in my opinion (and actually in the opinion of many if not most academically trained linguists worth considering) NO language is thus in any manner and in any way superior and those who attempt to claim this (especially if they are categorical and unilateral in and with their philosophies) are at best profoundly naive and at worst downright and frighteningly dangerous and full of propaganda. One star (and really, with The Mother Tongue: English and How it Got that Way , I actually almost wish I could give less than one star, and I have since reading or should I say since attempting to peruse this book actively shied away from trying any more offerings from Bill Bryson's pen, his seeming general popularity notwithstanding, especially and in particular since many of the \"facts\" the author has cited to cement his claims that English as a language is supposedly somehow superior to and of better and more lasting quality than other world languages are academically wrong anyhow, are not the truth or only partially the truth, and for a non-fiction linguistic tome, this just is not in any way even remotely acceptable)."

Well, a sample of two is not enough to go on, apparently because this turned out disappointing, for two primary reasons: 1. It was first published in 1990 and it has not aged well. Some statistics are well out of date, Bryson using a figure of 56 million for the population of Britain, with 60 million more accurate at the time I write, for example. The political position has moved on, too. 2. Errors and inconsistencies. Some statements are just plain wrong. At one point Bryson says that the Irish Prime Minister's title sounds like \"tea-sack\" when rendered into phonetic English spelling. This is just incoorect; it is more like \"tea-shock\" even \"tea-shop\" if one was not listening attentively. Bryson says that the six Celtic languages arose from one predecessor called Celtic. Every other source I've read uses the term Brythonic for this extinct predecessor. It's possible that philologists have changed their terminology and don't use the term \"Brythonic\" any more (just as they don't call themselves philologists anymore) but even if that is so, later Bryson suggests that Welsh is a Gaelic language, which no authority is going to agree with. As far as inconsistencies go, two stick with me: First Bryson tacitly identifies himself with Britain in the early part of the book, then later on as American...perhaps not surprising considering his Pond hoping tendencies. The second is worse; in the chapter on American accents and dialects he starts by agreeing that the USA shows less regional variation than britain and ends suggesting that there is, in fact, one dialect per person.... The effect of these two problems is to, one way or another, call into question the validity of just about everything expressed as a statement of fact, unless one already knows of an independent authority who agrees. This is most unfortunate, as the topic is fascinating and the writing is witty, though sometimes angry; English is also emotive!"

It's an excellent book, but like so many foreigners, Bryson thinks a quick tour makes him an expert on all things Australian. WRONG!! We don't say cookie, we say biscuit. Getting that wrong is clumsy. We don't normally say \"labor\", we call it labour. The sole exception is in the name of the Australian Labor Party, which adopted that spelling in the 19th century. Bomboras are in the sea, not in rivers, a didgeridoo is not a form of trumpet, and outback is not an Aboriginal word (though bombora is), and we don't normally say \"technicolour yawn\": it was a joke put forward by Barry Humphries, not common usage. I could go on and demolish his assertions about the Australian accents (he seems to think that any one of us speaks one, only) and if somebody is going to be arch about other people's proofing, page 139, the first page of chapter 10 needs to be looked at HARD. I like the book, I just didn't appreciate the superior tone of somebody who is, like the rest of us, inclined to slip from time to time."

        "text":"English is one crazy language. As a person who is not a native speaker, this book is very insightful in terms of how the most globalized language developed (and is still developing). It is similar with how history's made, there were wars, migrations, proliferation of mass media, the making of dictionaries, public figures making their own linguistic marks (and complete fools of themselves), class and regional divisions, and so on and so forth. Bryson is a funny guy. I think I have read at least two of his works previously and he never disappoints in making me chuckled or even roaring with laughter. True, there was a stultifying effect of him becoming too enthusiastic with his many, many examples, when he already made his points. That's my biggest gripe from reading this novel. Nevertheless, the book itself is a bundle of joy of finding invariably humorous take on how word changed - even corrupted - over the course of time. It is amusing to know people made mistakes and those mistakes held on until today. It made me wonder, though, since English is very much a dynamic language co-created together by the whole world depending on the generation, how much it will change in the next 100 years? We know that the Oxford Dictionary added \"twerk\", \"derp\" and \"selfie\" back in 2013 (which caused quite a bit of uproar), and in June 2017 alone, there are at least 100 new words. With the growing invasion of foreign and urbandictionary.com words, would English become the One True Lingua Franca? As for Indonesia, English speakers should feel more at home here (at least in the urban areas) in the next decade or more, with all these millennials\/gen-zs at the malls talking rather fluent English for their daily conversation. English book fairs are always loaded with people (and bloody, thieving online shops). I just hope the rest of the country can keep up with developing their skill. But I also hope that these fluent young speakers do not forget their own language."

That when they stub their toes, they say \"ravintolassa\" (in the the restaurant). Right. I've never heard that expression, but I've sure heard a whole plethora of other fascinating swear words depicting all manner of hell, damnation, and body parts. After all, \"perkele, saatana, vittu\" are the first three words most foreigners learn and particularly the last one (female body part) is sprinkled into conversation as filler, much like the German word \"aber\". So that's when the whole book fell apart for me, because if he couldn't get this part right, what other things might he have been wrong about? Earlier I had thought it fascinating that Lithuanian is one of the oldest European languages. I doubt it now. The book is entertaining and goes a long way to explain how English is spoken in so many parts of the world, much more so than Portuguese, another colonial language. It delves into history, dialects, distribution - and the aforementioned swear words. One more thing: don't try this on audio like I did. I heard so many words spelled out that my ears are still smarting."

They can breathe and swallow at the same time. No possibility of food going down the wrong way. With Homo sapiens, food and drink must pass over the larynx on the way to the gullet. Constant risk that some of it will be inhaled. The larynx descends in humans between the age of 3 and 5 months, the exact age when Sudden Infant Death occurs. But the descended larynx explains why we can speak and our pets cannot. That ability to speak made such a difference in our evolution. The word \"pease\" in \"pease porridge hot\" was singular. But people thought it was plural, so \"pea\" back then formed as a singular. In \"Pippa Passes,\" Robert Browning uses the word \"twat,\" which meant the same thing then as it does now, but he did not realize it. He thought it was a nun's hat instead of a nun's. . . .well, you know. Although English is a Germanic language, we have borrowed fewer words from German than almost any language. No one has any idea how the word \"dog\" came to replace the word \"hound.\" Gutenberg may have gotten more credit than he deserves for inventing the printing press. He learned of the process when an apprentice of Laurens Koster ran off with some of his blocks. Well meaning people added \"b\" to \"doubt\" and \"debt\" to keep it more like the Latin. Same with the \"p\" in \"receipt.\" The last words of French grammarian Dominique Bonhours: \"I am about to--or I am going to--die; either expression is used.\" Noah Webster produced a sanitized version of the Bible. In it, men have \"peculiar members\" instead of testicles, and women do not have wombs or anything else with which to contribute to the reproductive process. Such a fear of the human body. Where does it come from? The Oxford English Dictionary insists that Shakespeare should be spelled Shakspere. They add that the commonest spelling \"is perh. Shakespeare.\" Bryson adds \"it cert. is.\" The last name Bush came from wine merchants always having a bush by the front door. Goldwater was a synonym for urine. He has a great list of place names from America, including Maggie's Nipples, Wyoming. In 1970 under test conditions, Roy Dean solved the London Times crossword puzzle in 3 minutes and 45 seconds. An unbelievable feat. Alfred Butts invented the game Scrabble in 1931. He insisted on two of each letter, so q, j, and z can be a problem. He deliberately depressed the number of s's. He increased the number of i's to encourage the use of suffixes. The highest score in 1987 was 3,881 points. It included the word psycholoanalyzing for 1,539 points. A list of anagrams: Ronald Wilson Reagan = Insane Anglo Warlord Spiro Agnew = Grow a Penis two plus eleven = one plus twelve Western Union = No Wire Unsent circumstantial evidence = can ruin a selected victim funeral = real fun The Morse Code = Here come dots mother-in-law = woman Hitler Victoria, England's Queen = governs a nice quiet land William Shakespeare = We all make his praise In Chinese, to call someone a turtle is the worst possible taunt. The Japanese have no swear words at all. The Romans had 800 swear words."

And I liked this one too, but unfortunately not as much as In a Sunburned Country . And there are several reasons for that. Including the one that it can be at least partly my fault. And that's what I will start with. I am not an English native speaker. I have never lived in any English-speaking country. I have been learning English at school. I manage pretty well, I can read books in English without too much difficulty. Which does not change the fact that there are a lot of words that I do not know (and I'm fully aware of that). I am also not particularly sensitive to differences in pronunciation between British and American English. I mean, I'm aware of these differences (I am usually able to recognize an American and a British when I hear them), but I do not think I can pronounce the word first according to one and then according to the other pronunciation. I read this book in English and I must admit that although it is very interesting, as a non-English speaker, I was not able to fully appreciate it and understand it. On the other hand, as a foreigner who had to learn English (and I’m native in non-Roman language), Bryson's insight in this area was particularly interesting and accurate for me. Especially when it comes to intricate English pronunciation. So a big plus for that. Another issue, Bryson wrote his book in the late 1980s. The world has changed a lot since then. First of all, we have internet, which, at least in my opinion, makes British and American English even closer to each other and more similar. That is why the book seemed to be slightly outdated at times. I would love to read its modernized version. The above list of imperfections does not mean that I did not like the book. Just like always, it's easier for me to specify what I was not delighted with than what I like. And I must admit that this is a very good book. However, I think that it is directed primarily to English native speakers, because they will be able to capture and better understand all the issues that the author raises. Anyway, this is definitely not my last book by Bill Bryson. I can not wait to read another of his books. This time may be travel related."

I think the lesson here is that as a linguist, I should not be reading popular writings about language. It's true that there are a thousand interesting things to encounter in the history of the English language, replete as it is with situations of language contact. I think what bothers me most is the very thinly veiled \"linguo\"centrism that turns it from a piece of enthusiastic writing about the English language into a poorly-argued case for why English is better than every other language on the planet. As a native English speaker who spends every day contemplating and studying other languages, I can't disagree strongly enough with a message like that."

His view about machine translation is way out-of-date. He talks about a giant Chinese keyboard, which in fact never caught on. The Wubi method, invented in 1986, encodes Chinese characters by the five shapes of strokes and converts them to alphabetic characters on a generic keyboard. It gained popularity before being replaced by the Intelligent Pinyin method, which facilitates the standard phonetic representation of Chinese characters. Of course, Bill Bryson couldn't have foreseen how the Internet would change English (it would be interesting to know). He certainly loves English. On the dying of Irish (as a language), he says: \"we naturally lament the decline of these languages, but it's not an altogether undiluted tragedy. Consider the loss to English literature, if Joyce, Shaw, Swift, Yeats, Wilde, and Ireland's other literary masters have written in what inescapably a fringe language, their work will be as little known to us as those poets in Iceland or Norway, and that would be a tragedy indeed. No country has given the word incomparable literature per head of population than Ireland, and for that reason alone we might be excused to a small, \"selfish\" celebration that English was the language of her greatest writers.\" This is a hindsight bias. Nevertheless, it's a fun read. I've learned a lot. Maoris of New Zealand have 35 words for dung. The Arabs have 6000 words for camels and camel equipment. The aborigines of Tasmania have a word for every type of trees but no word for the concept of tree. The word \"nice\" meant \"stupid and foolish\" in 1290. In the next 700 years, its meaning has changed so many times that it is impossible to tell what sense Jane Austen intended when she wrote to a friend: \"You scold me so much in a nice long letter which I have received from you.\" The differences between American English and British English make me laugh! The history of swear words is fascinating. \"Bloody\" was worse than the F-word? And those Victorian sensibilities! Who knew the biggest contribution of American English to the language was actually \"OK\"! I agree that the many native English speakers don't bother to learn a second language. After reading this book, I decide to be less harsh on my own accent."

        "text":"Mother Tongue: The English Language , by Bill Bryson, London: Penguin Books, 1990 (link is to a different, in-print edition). Summary: This amusing and informative book surveys the history of the English language and all its vagaries and perplexities of word origins, spellings, and pronunciations and why it has become so successful as a world language . Has it every occurred to you how many different meanings there are for the word fly ? It can be an insect, a means of travel, a verb form of \"to flee\", something a fisherman ties, one of the results of a batter hitting a baseball, or something no man wants open in public. As in so many of Bryson's books, he had me at the opening page as he explored some of the perplexities of our language that native speakers negotiate almost without thought. He had me in the first chapter as he proposed that part of the success of the language is the incredible richness of vocabulary (at the time of publication, the OED had 615,000 words), flexibility of usage, and relative simplicity, particularly in comparison to tonal languages of rendering the language in print. He surveys the history of language, the world's language families and where English is situated in the Indo-European stream, and all the other offshoots, some which are no longer living languages. He recounts the triumph of Anglo-Saxon language over Celtic (even though many of England's place names preserve their Celtic roots), the impact of the Norman invasion (of 10,000 words, approximately 3\/4ths are still in use including much of the language of nobility (duke, baron prince) and much language of jurisprudence (justice, jury, prison among others). He explores the different ways words are created, sometimes by doing nothing! His discussion of pronunciation and particularly the shifts in vowel sounds was fascinating, For example house was once pronounced hoose. You weren't born in a barn but barn in a born. Then there is the matter of spelling and the role of printing and dictionaries in bring a greater if not complete uniformity to spelling--is it ax or axe , judgment or judgement (it is fascinating that the spell check in this word processor highlighted the latter of these two, and yet both are accepted with the shortened forms preferred). Of course so much of this discussion is the concern of some to promote the good and proper use of the language, and yet what is fascinating is the shifting ideas through history of what this is, according to Bryson. Similarly, we have the divergences between New World and Old and some wonder whether American English will become a distinct language. Bryson's concluding chapters explore the origins of proper names, our propensity for wordplay, and the history of what are now considered vulgarities (although I think since Bryson wrote, what was censored in from public media in my youth is becoming more and more common). What is fascinating is that many of these were once in common parlance in Chaucer and Shakespeare. Equally fascinating are our various forms of wordplay, the ultimate of which must be the palindrome where a sentence says the same thing forwards and backwards (an example from the book: \"A man, a plan, a canal, Panama.\") Anyone who writes can understand the challenges of finding the right rather than the almost right word, and how easy it is to think you are saying one thing only to be understood by others as saying the opposite. I found Bryson's book a delightful diversion that better helped me understand both the joy of using this language and the frustrations of rendering the conceptions of mind into words that communicate."

        "text":"Mother Tongue: Essays on the Origins and Usage of English My wife was lent this book by a British friend of ours, but I decided to read it as I've heard about Bill Bryson's popular travel books like Notes from a Small Island and book A Brief History of Everything, about his travels through England before moving back to the US after a long time in his adopted home. He's an interesting guy who grew up in Des Moines, Iowa, became a popular travel writer, and was even Chancellor of prestigious Durham University in the UK. So he's very much a bicultural American-Brit who can see different aspects of both societies from the inside and outside, and also has a wide-ranging intellect and deft sense of humor. Mother Tongue is a series of essays on the origins of human language, with plenty of interesting scientific insights, then to the messy origins of English amid the various waves of invasions of the original Celtic peoples of Britain by Angles, Saxons, Jutes, Normans, Scandinavians (Vikings), and so forth, to its growing status as a global language. I enjoyed this part of the book the most, learning a lot about the origins of the language that was especially useful now that I live in England myself. I also didn't know that Latin evolved into French, Spanish, and Italian among other languages, to my embarrassment. Given the many travels we've had through Europe in the past two years, a lot of the early origins of the Celtic peoples in Europe and the migrations of various peoples across the continent and to the British isles during the Stone, Bronze, and Iron Ages is really fascinating stuff. The middle portion of the book gets very involved in examining the evolution of English spellings and pronunciations as it moved from Old English to Modern English, and the further hiving off of American English from British English. Some of this was really illuminating, but the parts discussing the minute details of spelling and grammatical shifts were slow-going unless you are truly a student of the language and I found somewhat less interesting. The chapter on swearing was quite funny, there's plenty to learn there. And throughout the book Bryson's humor makes the subject matter interesting. However, though he does make regular references to other languages, the book is by its nature extremely English-centric so many of the statements about how unique English is are almost certainly inaccurate as he is not so authoritative a linguist so much as a very well-informed enthusiast. The book's 1990 publication also betrays its age as it is hopelessly out of date when describing how absurdly impractical the computer keyboards are for Chinese and Japanese users and how that has hindered their economic development. Can't blame a book for being out of date, so it's actually somewhat amusing to see how things can change so much in just a few decades. I'm looking forward to reading A Brief History of Everything next before moving onto his well-liked travel stories."

(And I'm not even a linguist.) All of this makes me question all the other \"facts\" I don't know anything about, I simply don't know if I've learned more about them from reading this book. The Acknowledgements of the book mentions several people, but I hope for their sake that he didn't follow their advice. Otherwise they should receive a dishonorable mention and be out of work. I give it one star because Bill Bryson writes well. Review part I: Bringing science to the people, Bill Bryson style, is always funny and edcuational. However, this book is old, (it was written before the Wall came down, which is evident in the mentioning of the number of citizens of the Soviet Union who don't speak Russian) and a lot has happened in the lingustic field since then. So I'm not sure the information is always correct. Until I find out, I will simply enjoy the book as is :-) One curious thing: Norwegians supposedly \"talk about departing like an Englishman\" (p7) Eh, really? Never heard of that. Googling it, I find only quotes from this book. Update: Not sure I'll finish this book. I was worried it'd be outdated, but that's only part of the problem. There are so many inaccuracies, facts that are not facts at all and some Bryson attitude issues. I've mentioned the Norwegian example above and other Goodreads reviews mentions that, according to this book, mordern Finnish has no swear words (!) and Bryson's understanding of (to him) foreign languages like Japanese and German leads to wrong or not quite accurate conclusions. Also quotes like \"As of 1989, the Basque separatist organization ETA ... had committed 672 murders in the name of linguistic and cultural independence\" (p35) is rather particular, to say the least. His rant about funny Welsh spelling and pronounciation is silly. (p36) In some languages, like Spanish, spelling and pronounciation are almost the same, in other languages, like Danish and apparantly Welsh, they are not. Also, the pronounciation of a specific language is difficult or easy according to your own mother tongue. German to me is easy, Japanese is difficult. A book like this should acknowledge these things."

Bryson's true gift is in making the nature of linguistics both understandable and relevant. The author has fun playing with words - I laughed out loud multiple times. The best chapter is the one on what is considered obscene language, not because it feels good to curse, but because it increases your cultural awareness and empathy to think about how a conquering nation determines what words are proper and what words are vile. It might make you think twice before you correct the way someone speaks with a regional dialect. Bryson isn't about prescriptive grammar and language elitism, but about exploring the nature of human communication. Should we really isolate someone because they speak differently than we do? Language is a natural and essential aspect of the human condition and the more you know about language evolution and acquisition, the more you should appreciate the diversity of successful communications."

Any language where the unassuming word fly signifies an annoying insect, a means of travel, and a critical part of a gentleman’s apparel is clearly asking to be mangled.” Say what you want, Bill Bryson, but English is actually ridiculously easy. Not that I’m perfect in it, but still, compared to other languages, it’s a piece of cake. Even with those pesky indefinite and definite articles — I’ll still take those over conjugations and declensions and all that other stuff English seems to have just shrugged off to everyone’s benefit. The spelling — well, if seven-year-old Nataliya was able to get past the sheer mortification of spelling “cat” as “kat” in her first English class in school, so can everyone else. “Language, never forget, is more fashion than science, and matters of usage, spelling, and pronunciation tend to wander around like hemlines.” Languages evolve naturally, sometimes slowly and sometimes unexpectedly fast, with everything contributing to that, even misspellings and misunderstandings. Spelling can follow pronunciation, but then we also have pronunciation change due to new spelling fads (like adding “t” to “often” and “b” to “debt”). The origins of English are basically a mishmash of so many influences, and I never get tired of all the anecdotes and Bryson-style tangents. What I love is that Bryson is not a self-appointed grammarian and is quite clear about his views on the completely arbitrary grammar conventions that have no basis whatsoever other than some stuffy pedant deciding on a way to separate the elite from the plebs. After all, “Considerations of what makes for good English or bad English are to an uncomfortably large extent matters of prejudice and conditioning.” “So if there are no officially appointed guardians for the English language, who sets down all those rules that we all know about from childhood—the idea that we must never end a sentence with a preposition or begin one with a conjunction, that we must use each other for two things and one another for more than two, and that we must never use hopefully in an absolute sense, such as “Hopefully it will not rain tomorrow”? The answer, surprisingly often, is that no one does, that when you look into the background of these “rules” there is often little basis for them.” And so I will happily go on starting my sentences with “And…” and ending them with prepositions while splitting every infinitive I can possibly find. “I can think of two very good reasons for not splitting an infinitive. 1. Because you feel that the rules of English ought to conform to the grammatical precepts of a language that died a thousand years ago. 2. Because you wish to cling to a pointless affectation of usage that is without the support of any recognized authority of the last 200 years, even at the cost of composing sentences that are ambiguous, inelegant, and patently contorted.” Image borrowed from The Jenkins comic strip here: https:\/\/thejenkinscomic.wordpress.com... . I do adore reading about British and American English differences — hey, our linguistic peculiarities here in the US are because we held on to saying things like “gotten” that the Brits have since forgotten. We are charming this way, I suppose. (And those poor 18th century public US figures had to dejectedly apologize to those Brits about Americanisms. Hey, without us you’d still be using “gyratory circuses” instead of roundabouts. But sadly, despite what we’d love to think, Shakespeare - or perhaps Shakspere - did not sound like an Appalachian farmer). “Sometimes these differences in meaning take on a kind of bewildering circularity. A tramp in Britain is a bum in America, while a bum in Britain is a fanny in America, while a fanny in Britain is—well, we’ve covered that. To a foreigner it must seem sometimes as if we are being intentionally contrary.” ———— Arguably America’s single greatest gift to international discourse, O.K. is the most grammatically versatile of words, able to serve as an adjective (“Lunch was O.K.”), verb (“Can you O.K. this for me?”), noun (“I need your O.K. on this”), interjection (“O.K., I hear you”), and adverb (“We did O.K.”). It can carry shades of meaning that range from casual assent (“Shall we go?” “O.K.”), to great enthusiasm (“O.K.!”), to lukewarm endorsement (“The party was O.K.”), to a more or less meaningless filler of space (“O.K., can I have your attention please?”). Bill Bryson is funny and very enthusiastic, sometimes overwhelmingly so, but it’s very endearing. This book is not a scholarly work by any means but rather a bunch of anecdotes told in such a manner that you just can’t stop reading (or listening on a few long hikes in my case). I’m a sucker for such enthusiastic sincere humor, so it was right up my alley. And even though some things are clearly a bit dated in information and attitudes (the book was published in 1990), it didn't spoil the experience for me. “Perhaps for our last words on the subject of usage we should turn to the last words of the venerable French grammarian Dominique Bonhours, who proved on his deathbed that a grammarian’s work is never done when he turned to those gathered loyally around him and whispered: “I am about to—or I am going to—die; either expression is used.” For a more scholarly approach I do highly advise reading David Crystal ’s books, which I do plan to reread, actually, but for a fun diversion for a few hours Bryson is good. 3.5 stars."

I'm what you might call a big fan of language. A dabbler. Certainly not an expert. But boy, did I find this book infuriating. My problem with this book is that it gets so much right, and so much wrong. The example that really set me off was his treatment of the Welsh language. To Bryson, Welsh is \"as unpronounceable as it looks\", and Welsh pronunciations \"rarely bear much relation to their spellings.\" He then spouts off with a series of jokes that are so ethnocentric and condescending that, if you took them at face value, you couldn't help but feel sorry for the poor backward speakers of silly old Welsh. The problem is, he's completely wrong. I happened to study the phonology and orthography of Welsh for about a week in that freshman linguistics class (I know, that makes me a big authority, right?) but in that week I learned something Bryson apparently never bothered to look up: Welsh orthography is remarkably regular, about as regular as Spanish. It's not at all difficult if you bother to learn the rules, which are far simpler than those of English. (The fact that I learned them in one week, and remember them decades later, should be some indication of how easy they are.) The phoneme represented by the double-l is called a lateral fricative, and yes, it's hard to pronounce if you don't speak Welsh, but that does not mean it's sometimes pronounced \"kl\" and other times \"thl\" as Bryson suggests. It is always pronounced just like it's spelled. But Bryson's Anglo-American tin ear failed to pick that up, and he took his ignorance and turned it into a cheap joke at another culture's expense. Knowing that he got Welsh so wrong made me doubt all of the rest of the information in the book. And that's a real shame, because it covers such fascinating topics, and it's so very entertainingly written. But it's hard to enjoy Bryson's jokes when you have this nagging suspicion that he's bending the truth for the sake of a snappy punchline."

So, Bill Bryson + cheap equals insta-buy for me, apparently. Too bad even Bill Bryson couldn't make this terribly entertaining. I have a long history as \"the obscure facts guy\" at social gatherings, at least, I did when people still invited me to such things. However, even I had trouble sticking with this one at times. Old Bill is in fine form, cracking wise and still being informative at every opportunity. He didn't get much in the way of interesting material to work with in this case. The book was not without its moments, however. I did enjoy the chapter on swearing, as well as numerous tidbits, or titbits, as they were called in a less prudish era, that peppered the other chapters. Too bad the gems were scarce and some of the reading resembled the back-breaking labor involved in mining. While I found the book informative and mildly amusing, at the end of the day, it's still a book about the history of words. Even one of the funnier travel writers alive can't make chicken salad from chicken feathers in this case. 2.5 out of 5."

        "text":"Ever since I learned to read, English has been my favourite language - I took to it like a duck takes to water (at least, I guess they take to it willingly, and that baby ducks are not paddled until their feathers fly by Mamma Duck to make them). This was the cause of the eternal chagrin of my mother who, being a staunch nationalist, wanted me to prefer Hindi over English. She recited to me a famous couplet in Malayalam, which said: \"Other languages are merely nannies; For man, the native tongue is the mother.\" I replied that in that case, Malayalam is my mother, and both Hindi and English are nannies. And I just happened to prefer my English nanny over my native one. She had no answer to that! Well, I am glad I stuck to English over Hindi, because this is one crazy nanny - totally idiosyncratic and eccentric, just like me. And to tell you how eccentric, who better than Bill Bryson? If you approach this book hoping for a scholarly analysis of the English language, you are going to be sorely disappointed. For that don't come to old Bill. What he does is to throw out titbits (or tidbits in the US, as they the consider the former spelling risque - so Bryson tells me) of information, some useful, some useless, some bizarre: but all fascinating. One thing you can be sure of - you won't be disappointed. This book is a linguistic, historical and geographical romp through English wherein Bill tackles such varied subjects as 1. The origin and spread of English 2. The evolution of words 3. Pronunciation 4. Spelling 5. The varieties of English, both inside the UK and outside 6. Dictionaries and their producers 7. Where names come from 8. Profanity 9. Wordplay ... and much more. There is not a single boring sentence. You are guaranteed to be snickering throughout."

I started this with enthusiasm and was enjoying his breezy style until it occurred to me that a lot of what he was saying seemed to be anecdotal. You know, limited or no research. Then I thought, well, it was written more than 25 years ago, so things that sounded like old stories to me may have been new stories then – like this one: “The Eskimos, as is well known, have fifty words for types of snow—though curiously no word for just plain snow. To them there is crunchy snow, soft snow, fresh snow, and old snow, but no word that just means snow.” There’s a wealth of articles about this half-truth (I’m being generous). Here’s one http:\/\/www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca... So how many grains of salt would I need to swallow the declaration that immediately followed? An unhealthy amount, I’m sure. “The Italians, as we might expect, have over 500 names for different types of macaroni.” He goes on to say these include “spaghetti and vermicelli.” He obviously means types of pasta . Then he got into some languages I have a smattering of myself – French and German—and I began questioning. Some of it just sounded wrong, like the quote from an article that says most speakers of other languages aren’t aware there is such a thing as a thesaurus. At this point, I decided I’d read some reviews to see if anyone who knows more than I do felt the same way. Sadly, there are a lot. You can check the low-rating reviews on Amazon that actually discuss the many factual errors. I stopped reading, thinking I might accidentally absorb some of the \"facts\" and perpetuate them myself! How disappointing. One star for the writing."

It has since been pointed out, repeatedly, that Bryson is wrong in a staggering number of places in this book, and as I went on to read more of his work, I also realized exactly how racist he is. I don't read or recommend his books anymore. Here's my original review from 2006, preserved as an artifact of how I was wrong: Published in 1990, this book is already a little out of date. In its first pages, Bryson reports OED editor Robert Burchfield's theory that American English and British English are drifting apart so rapidly that within two hundred years we won't be able to understand each other. That was a theory made back when cell phones still required a battery the size of an unabridged dictionary, long before the internet became such a large part of the way the world communicates, in a time when you couldn't imagine downloading a British Doctor Who or an American Stargate Atlantis to your iPod. We live in a new world! Unfortunately it's also a world where the Harry Potter books are \"translated\" for American readers, lest we be too confused by the lingo: \"What's this? Harry's eating a biscuit? And wearing a jumper? While battling Fizzolian Snargletoothed Whatsits?! This book is impenetrable!\" JK Rowling aside, with communication technology becoming smaller, cheaper, and more powerful, I think we'll still be able to communicate two hundred years down the line. Bryson eventually disagrees with Burchfield for many of the same reasons, though he was unable to cite the internet as a factor. In that way, this book is showing its age -- the chapter on online language use is, of course, conspicuously absent -- but it's got the history part down. Bryson spends most of his time looking at how we got where we are today. Where English came from, how it got to England, where it went from there. With its in-text references, footnotes, extensive bibliography and index, this book looks almost academic, but Bryson, an American living in England, handles it all with a cheerfully low-key sense of humor -- almost as if Terry Pratchett had turned his eye to grammar -- and even a refreshingly open approach to the word fuck in the chapter on swearing. My one complaint is that, despite being loosely hung on British and American history, for the most part the book lacks a greater structure and ends up reading like a series of interesting facts. But, hell, they got my attention, and, as it happened, the attention of everyone around me: \"Hey! Did you know the Romans had no word for grey ?\" Since English, as this book proves, is a big crazy mess, I guess Bryson can be excused for not being able to wrangle its history into a more pleasing order. Lack of structure aside, I really enjoyed reading this and will be reading more books by Bryson in the future."

Furthermore there is no preposition in any language that cannot be translated into at least three or four prepositions in English, nor are there any English prepositions that don't have numerous translations in the other language. That's just how prepositions are! They don't translate! The first chapter of this book has so many mistakes that I couldn't finish it. Almost every sentence has a mistake. It is a collage of newspaper clippings. If you read the credits at the back you'll see that he only consulted newspapers and magazines and did no real research. I can't go through all the mistakes, I really don't have the time, there are just too many. If it continues in this way then this is a work of complete and utter fiction.

The subject matter is not that hard, so I can only guess \"The Mother Tongue\" was written in such a hurry that you only consulted one or two sources, where it should have been five or six. The history of English is not something you learn from reading one textbook; there is a lot of ongoing research and debate. And most of your sources are a decade or two out of date, even for 1991. Get your facts straight and publish a revised edition is the best advice I can give you. And as for my fellow readers: buy David Crystal's The Stories of English instead.

        "text":"I'm a longtime fan of Bill Bryson, but I had never read this early nonfiction work of his and was delighted to see that my library had a copy of the audiobook. \"The Mother Tongue\" has the expected rambling charm of a Bryson nonfiction work. When he becomes enamored on a topic (such as the history of our houses in \"At Home\" or the history of our universe in \"A Short History of Nearly Everything\") Bryson digs up all kinds of interesting facts and stories and anecdotes and puts it all together in a delightfully interesting collection of essays. In this book, he discusses the history of the English language, but also the history of languages in general, the history of dictionaries, and many of the odd pronunciations and spellings that are so peculiar to English. Knowing that \"The Mother Tongue\" was published in 1990, I had fun imagining what additions Bryson would have added to the text today, knowing how many new words have been adopted since the Internet took over our world. Overall, this was a pleasant read and is a nice complement to other books that have been written about the English language. Recommended. Opening Passage \"More than 300 million people in the world speak English and the rest, it sometimes seems, try to. It would be charitable to say that the results are sometimes mixed. Consider this hearty announcement in a Yugoslavian hotel: 'The flattening of underwear with pleasure is the job of the chambermaid. Turn to her straightaway.' Or this warning to motorists in Tokyo: 'When a passenger of the foot heave in sight, tootle the horn. Trumpet at him melodiously at first, but if he still obstacles your passage, then tootle him with vigor.' Or these instructions gracing a packet of convenience food from Italy: 'Besmear a backing pan, previously buttered with a good tomato sauce, and, after dispose the cannelloni, lightly distanced between them in a only couch.' Clearly the writer of that message was not about to let a little ignorance of English stand in the way of a good meal. In fact, it would appear that one of the beauties of the English language is that even with the most tenuous grasp you can speak volumes if you show enough enthusiasm — a willingness to tootle with vigor, as it were.\""

Published in 1990, the book was written before Internet changed the way the world communicates and hence a lot of the content regarding the spread of languages is hopelessly outdated by now. Bryson is not a linguist, neither is he a historian. Therefore his attempts to explain the popularity and status of English as the lingua franca of the modern world come off haphazard at best. Bryson's love for his native English is clear enough; so is his painfully obvious lack of knowledge of any other languages. I did not care to keep count of the times he falsely asserts some feature in English cannot be found in any other language or blatantly moves the goalposts to prove how infinitely richer English is compared to anything. For all the little anecdotes and copious bits of trivia it contains, I really want to like the book more than I do. Unfortunately once it becomes clear that many of these factoids won't stand up to closer scrutiny -- Bryson doesn't even blink as he repeats the age-old and very disputed claim that the Eskimos have 50 words for snow -- it becomes hard to believe anything the book claims. The most baffling and outrageous claim of all is the one that strikes closest to home. Bryson has the audacity to suggest we Finns have no native swear words and use the phrase \"in the restaurant\" as a curse instead. Perkele, I say."

However, I for one have generally and usually found Bryson’s general tone of narrational voice and the boastful, arrogant demeanour he constantly seems to present and yes indeed often downright spew in The Mother Tongue: English and How it Got that Way extremely off-putting and really at best massively condescending, with his claims regarding the supposed superiority of the English language both unacademic and yes, profoundly bigoted and stereotyping (and as such of course absolutely devoid of any kind of linguistic acumen and actual bona fide language based knowledge). And albeit granted that English is at present a so-called and even aptly labelled world language, the reasons why English is such, the reasons why English is so profoundly popular and globally strong at present are NOT (at least in in my humble opinion) due to any type of linguistic superiority, they are primarily and simply cultural and historic in nature and also have much to do with economics and not with English being in any manner a better and superior language linguistically speaking than French, German, Chinese, Russian and so on and so on. And quite frankly, Mr. Bryson (and if you are perhaps offended by this, sorry, but I really and truly care not), your considerations about English and that you somehow think and assume the language is somehow better, is supposedly more advanced and of higher quality than other languages, this attitude truly makes me as a person of German background cringe profoundly, as it so strongly and uncomfortably does tend to remind me of the type of rhetoric that was used in the Third Reich by Adolf Hitler and his ilk to claim and attempt to demonstrate that German (that the Germanic languages) were supposedly both linguistically and genetically superior and more advanced than other language groups and families. However, languages are simply languages and in my opinion (and actually in the opinion of many if not most academically trained linguists worth considering) NO language is thus in any manner and in any way superior and those who attempt to claim this (especially if they are categorical and unilateral in and with their philosophies) are at best profoundly naive and at worst downright and frighteningly dangerous and full of propaganda. One star (and really, with The Mother Tongue: English and How it Got that Way , I actually almost wish I could give less than one star, and I have since reading or should I say since attempting to peruse this book actively shied away from trying any more offerings from Bill Bryson's pen, his seeming general popularity notwithstanding, especially and in particular since many of the \"facts\" the author has cited to cement his claims that English as a language is supposedly somehow superior to and of better and more lasting quality than other world languages are academically wrong anyhow, are not the truth or only partially the truth, and for a non-fiction linguistic tome, this just is not in any way even remotely acceptable)."

Well, a sample of two is not enough to go on, apparently because this turned out disappointing, for two primary reasons: 1. It was first published in 1990 and it has not aged well. Some statistics are well out of date, Bryson using a figure of 56 million for the population of Britain, with 60 million more accurate at the time I write, for example. The political position has moved on, too. 2. Errors and inconsistencies. Some statements are just plain wrong. At one point Bryson says that the Irish Prime Minister's title sounds like \"tea-sack\" when rendered into phonetic English spelling. This is just incoorect; it is more like \"tea-shock\" even \"tea-shop\" if one was not listening attentively. Bryson says that the six Celtic languages arose from one predecessor called Celtic. Every other source I've read uses the term Brythonic for this extinct predecessor. It's possible that philologists have changed their terminology and don't use the term \"Brythonic\" any more (just as they don't call themselves philologists anymore) but even if that is so, later Bryson suggests that Welsh is a Gaelic language, which no authority is going to agree with. As far as inconsistencies go, two stick with me: First Bryson tacitly identifies himself with Britain in the early part of the book, then later on as American...perhaps not surprising considering his Pond hoping tendencies. The second is worse; in the chapter on American accents and dialects he starts by agreeing that the USA shows less regional variation than britain and ends suggesting that there is, in fact, one dialect per person.... The effect of these two problems is to, one way or another, call into question the validity of just about everything expressed as a statement of fact, unless one already knows of an independent authority who agrees. This is most unfortunate, as the topic is fascinating and the writing is witty, though sometimes angry; English is also emotive!"

It is similar with how history's made, there were wars, migrations, proliferation of mass media, the making of dictionaries, public figures making their own linguistic marks (and complete fools of themselves), class and regional divisions, and so on and so forth. Bryson is a funny guy. I think I have read at least two of his works previously and he never disappoints in making me chuckled or even roaring with laughter. True, there was a stultifying effect of him becoming too enthusiastic with his many, many examples, when he already made his points. That's my biggest gripe from reading this novel. Nevertheless, the book itself is a bundle of joy of finding invariably humorous take on how word changed - even corrupted - over the course of time. It is amusing to know people made mistakes and those mistakes held on until today. It made me wonder, though, since English is very much a dynamic language co-created together by the whole world depending on the generation, how much it will change in the next 100 years? We know that the Oxford Dictionary added \"twerk\", \"derp\" and \"selfie\" back in 2013 (which caused quite a bit of uproar), and in June 2017 alone, there are at least 100 new words. With the growing invasion of foreign and urbandictionary.com words, would English become the One True Lingua Franca? As for Indonesia, English speakers should feel more at home here (at least in the urban areas) in the next decade or more, with all these millennials\/gen-zs at the malls talking rather fluent English for their daily conversation. English book fairs are always loaded with people (and bloody, thieving online shops). I just hope the rest of the country can keep up with developing their skill.

After all, \"perkele, saatana, vittu\" are the first three words most foreigners learn and particularly the last one (female body part) is sprinkled into conversation as filler, much like the German word \"aber\".

Earlier I had thought it fascinating that Lithuanian is one of the oldest European languages. I doubt it now.

Constant risk that some of it will be inhaled. The larynx descends in humans between the age of 3 and 5 months, the exact age when Sudden Infant Death occurs. But the descended larynx explains why we can speak and our pets cannot. That ability to speak made such a difference in our evolution. The word \"pease\" in \"pease porridge hot\" was singular. But people thought it was plural, so \"pea\" back then formed as a singular. In \"Pippa Passes,\" Robert Browning uses the word \"twat,\" which meant the same thing then as it does now, but he did not realize it. He thought it was a nun's hat instead of a nun's. . . .well, you know. Although English is a Germanic language, we have borrowed fewer words from German than almost any language. No one has any idea how the word \"dog\" came to replace the word \"hound.\" Gutenberg may have gotten more credit than he deserves for inventing the printing press. He learned of the process when an apprentice of Laurens Koster ran off with some of his blocks. Well meaning people added \"b\" to \"doubt\" and \"debt\" to keep it more like the Latin. Same with the \"p\" in \"receipt.\" The last words of French grammarian Dominique Bonhours: \"I am about to--or I am going to--die; either expression is used.\" Noah Webster produced a sanitized version of the Bible. In it, men have \"peculiar members\" instead of testicles, and women do not have wombs or anything else with which to contribute to the reproductive process. Such a fear of the human body. Where does it come from? The Oxford English Dictionary insists that Shakespeare should be spelled Shakspere. They add that the commonest spelling \"is perh. Shakespeare.\" Bryson adds \"it cert. is.\" The last name Bush came from wine merchants always having a bush by the front door. Goldwater was a synonym for urine.

        "text":"I found Bill Bryson about a month ago when I read hilarious In a Sunburned Country . I liked that one a lot and decided to try out his other book. And I liked this one too, but unfortunately not as much as In a Sunburned Country . And there are several reasons for that. Including the one that it can be at least partly my fault. And that's what I will start with. I am not an English native speaker. I have never lived in any English-speaking country. I have been learning English at school. I manage pretty well, I can read books in English without too much difficulty. Which does not change the fact that there are a lot of words that I do not know (and I'm fully aware of that). I am also not particularly sensitive to differences in pronunciation between British and American English. I mean, I'm aware of these differences (I am usually able to recognize an American and a British when I hear them), but I do not think I can pronounce the word first according to one and then according to the other pronunciation. I read this book in English and I must admit that although it is very interesting, as a non-English speaker, I was not able to fully appreciate it and understand it. On the other hand, as a foreigner who had to learn English (and I’m native in non-Roman language), Bryson's insight in this area was particularly interesting and accurate for me. Especially when it comes to intricate English pronunciation. So a big plus for that. Another issue, Bryson wrote his book in the late 1980s. The world has changed a lot since then. First of all, we have internet, which, at least in my opinion, makes British and American English even closer to each other and more similar. That is why the book seemed to be slightly outdated at times. I would love to read its modernized version. The above list of imperfections does not mean that I did not like the book. Just like always, it's easier for me to specify what I was not delighted with than what I like. And I must admit that this is a very good book. However, I think that it is directed primarily to English native speakers, because they will be able to capture and better understand all the issues that the author raises. Anyway, this is definitely not my last book by Bill Bryson. I can not wait to read another of his books. This time may be travel related."

Some of the stories are interesting, and even reasonably factual, but at other times the failed fact-checking is glaringly obvious--and come on, the perpetuation of the \"Eskimo Snow Myth\"? I think the lesson here is that as a linguist, I should not be reading popular writings about language. It's true that there are a thousand interesting things to encounter in the history of the English language, replete as it is with situations of language contact. I think what bothers me most is the very thinly veiled \"linguo\"centrism that turns it from a piece of enthusiastic writing about the English language into a poorly-argued case for why English is better than every other language on the planet. As a native English speaker who spends every day contemplating and studying other languages, I can't disagree strongly enough with a message like that."

        "text":"The Mother Tongue is somewhat dated. I did not realize it was published in 1990 until hearing \"Soviet Union\" mentioned in the present tense. His view about machine translation is way out-of-date. He talks about a giant Chinese keyboard, which in fact never caught on. The Wubi method, invented in 1986, encodes Chinese characters by the five shapes of strokes and converts them to alphabetic characters on a generic keyboard. It gained popularity before being replaced by the Intelligent Pinyin method, which facilitates the standard phonetic representation of Chinese characters. Of course, Bill Bryson couldn't have foreseen how the Internet would change English (it would be interesting to know). He certainly loves English. On the dying of Irish (as a language), he says: \"we naturally lament the decline of these languages, but it's not an altogether undiluted tragedy. Consider the loss to English literature, if Joyce, Shaw, Swift, Yeats, Wilde, and Ireland's other literary masters have written in what inescapably a fringe language, their work will be as little known to us as those poets in Iceland or Norway, and that would be a tragedy indeed. No country has given the word incomparable literature per head of population than Ireland, and for that reason alone we might be excused to a small, \"selfish\" celebration that English was the language of her greatest writers.\" This is a hindsight bias. Nevertheless, it's a fun read. I've learned a lot. Maoris of New Zealand have 35 words for dung. The Arabs have 6000 words for camels and camel equipment. The aborigines of Tasmania have a word for every type of trees but no word for the concept of tree. The word \"nice\" meant \"stupid and foolish\" in 1290. In the next 700 years, its meaning has changed so many times that it is impossible to tell what sense Jane Austen intended when she wrote to a friend: \"You scold me so much in a nice long letter which I have received from you.\" The differences between American English and British English make me laugh! The history of swear words is fascinating. \"Bloody\" was worse than the F-word? And those Victorian sensibilities! Who knew the biggest contribution of American English to the language was actually \"OK\"! I agree that the many native English speakers don't bother to learn a second language. After reading this book, I decide to be less harsh on my own accent."

        "text":"Mother Tongue: The English Language , by Bill Bryson, London: Penguin Books, 1990 (link is to a different, in-print edition). Summary: This amusing and informative book surveys the history of the English language and all its vagaries and perplexities of word origins, spellings, and pronunciations and why it has become so successful as a world language . Has it every occurred to you how many different meanings there are for the word fly ? It can be an insect, a means of travel, a verb form of \"to flee\", something a fisherman ties, one of the results of a batter hitting a baseball, or something no man wants open in public. As in so many of Bryson's books, he had me at the opening page as he explored some of the perplexities of our language that native speakers negotiate almost without thought. He had me in the first chapter as he proposed that part of the success of the language is the incredible richness of vocabulary (at the time of publication, the OED had 615,000 words), flexibility of usage, and relative simplicity, particularly in comparison to tonal languages of rendering the language in print. He surveys the history of language, the world's language families and where English is situated in the Indo-European stream, and all the other offshoots, some which are no longer living languages. He recounts the triumph of Anglo-Saxon language over Celtic (even though many of England's place names preserve their Celtic roots), the impact of the Norman invasion (of 10,000 words, approximately 3\/4ths are still in use including much of the language of nobility (duke, baron prince) and much language of jurisprudence (justice, jury, prison among others). He explores the different ways words are created, sometimes by doing nothing! His discussion of pronunciation and particularly the shifts in vowel sounds was fascinating, For example house was once pronounced hoose. You weren't born in a barn but barn in a born. Then there is the matter of spelling and the role of printing and dictionaries in bring a greater if not complete uniformity to spelling--is it ax or axe , judgment or judgement (it is fascinating that the spell check in this word processor highlighted the latter of these two, and yet both are accepted with the shortened forms preferred). Of course so much of this discussion is the concern of some to promote the good and proper use of the language, and yet what is fascinating is the shifting ideas through history of what this is, according to Bryson. Similarly, we have the divergences between New World and Old and some wonder whether American English will become a distinct language. Bryson's concluding chapters explore the origins of proper names, our propensity for wordplay, and the history of what are now considered vulgarities (although I think since Bryson wrote, what was censored in from public media in my youth is becoming more and more common). What is fascinating is that many of these were once in common parlance in Chaucer and Shakespeare. Equally fascinating are our various forms of wordplay, the ultimate of which must be the palindrome where a sentence says the same thing forwards and backwards (an example from the book: \"A man, a plan, a canal, Panama.\") Anyone who writes can understand the challenges of finding the right rather than the almost right word, and how easy it is to think you are saying one thing only to be understood by others as saying the opposite. I found Bryson's book a delightful diversion that better helped me understand both the joy of using this language and the frustrations of rendering the conceptions of mind into words that communicate."

        "text":"Mother Tongue: Essays on the Origins and Usage of English My wife was lent this book by a British friend of ours, but I decided to read it as I've heard about Bill Bryson's popular travel books like Notes from a Small Island and book A Brief History of Everything, about his travels through England before moving back to the US after a long time in his adopted home. He's an interesting guy who grew up in Des Moines, Iowa, became a popular travel writer, and was even Chancellor of prestigious Durham University in the UK. So he's very much a bicultural American-Brit who can see different aspects of both societies from the inside and outside, and also has a wide-ranging intellect and deft sense of humor. Mother Tongue is a series of essays on the origins of human language, with plenty of interesting scientific insights, then to the messy origins of English amid the various waves of invasions of the original Celtic peoples of Britain by Angles, Saxons, Jutes, Normans, Scandinavians (Vikings), and so forth, to its growing status as a global language. I enjoyed this part of the book the most, learning a lot about the origins of the language that was especially useful now that I live in England myself. I also didn't know that Latin evolved into French, Spanish, and Italian among other languages, to my embarrassment. Given the many travels we've had through Europe in the past two years, a lot of the early origins of the Celtic peoples in Europe and the migrations of various peoples across the continent and to the British isles during the Stone, Bronze, and Iron Ages is really fascinating stuff. The middle portion of the book gets very involved in examining the evolution of English spellings and pronunciations as it moved from Old English to Modern English, and the further hiving off of American English from British English. Some of this was really illuminating, but the parts discussing the minute details of spelling and grammatical shifts were slow-going unless you are truly a student of the language and I found somewhat less interesting. The chapter on swearing was quite funny, there's plenty to learn there. And throughout the book Bryson's humor makes the subject matter interesting. However, though he does make regular references to other languages, the book is by its nature extremely English-centric so many of the statements about how unique English is are almost certainly inaccurate as he is not so authoritative a linguist so much as a very well-informed enthusiast. The book's 1990 publication also betrays its age as it is hopelessly out of date when describing how absurdly impractical the computer keyboards are for Chinese and Japanese users and how that has hindered their economic development. Can't blame a book for being out of date, so it's actually somewhat amusing to see how things can change so much in just a few decades. I'm looking forward to reading A Brief History of Everything next before moving onto his well-liked travel stories."

        "text":"Why was this book even published? There are so many errors, inaccuracies, misconceptions, misunderstandings and whatnot, I don't even know where to begin. (And I'm not even a linguist.) All of this makes me question all the other \"facts\" I don't know anything about, I simply don't know if I've learned more about them from reading this book. The Acknowledgements of the book mentions several people, but I hope for their sake that he didn't follow their advice. Otherwise they should receive a dishonorable mention and be out of work. I give it one star because Bill Bryson writes well. Review part I: Bringing science to the people, Bill Bryson style, is always funny and edcuational. However, this book is old, (it was written before the Wall came down, which is evident in the mentioning of the number of citizens of the Soviet Union who don't speak Russian) and a lot has happened in the lingustic field since then. So I'm not sure the information is always correct. Until I find out, I will simply enjoy the book as is :-) One curious thing: Norwegians supposedly \"talk about departing like an Englishman\" (p7) Eh, really? Never heard of that. Googling it, I find only quotes from this book. Update: Not sure I'll finish this book. I was worried it'd be outdated, but that's only part of the problem. There are so many inaccuracies, facts that are not facts at all and some Bryson attitude issues. I've mentioned the Norwegian example above and other Goodreads reviews mentions that, according to this book, mordern Finnish has no swear words (!) and Bryson's understanding of (to him) foreign languages like Japanese and German leads to wrong or not quite accurate conclusions. Also quotes like \"As of 1989, the Basque separatist organization ETA ... had committed 672 murders in the name of linguistic and cultural independence\" (p35) is rather particular, to say the least. His rant about funny Welsh spelling and pronounciation is silly. (p36) In some languages, like Spanish, spelling and pronounciation are almost the same, in other languages, like Danish and apparantly Welsh, they are not. Also, the pronounciation of a specific language is difficult or easy according to your own mother tongue. German to me is easy, Japanese is difficult. A book like this should acknowledge these things."

I read this for my college rhetoric class, and fell in love with the enjoyable read with knowledge worthy of an upper level college English class. Bryson's true gift is in making the nature of linguistics both understandable and relevant. The author has fun playing with words - I laughed out loud multiple times. The best chapter is the one on what is considered obscene language, not because it feels good to curse, but because it increases your cultural awareness and empathy to think about how a conquering nation determines what words are proper and what words are vile. It might make you think twice before you correct the way someone speaks with a regional dialect. Bryson isn't about prescriptive grammar and language elitism, but about exploring the nature of human communication. Should we really isolate someone because they speak differently than we do? Language is a natural and essential aspect of the human condition and the more you know about language evolution and acquisition, the more you should appreciate the diversity of successful communications."

Any language where the unassuming word fly signifies an annoying insect, a means of travel, and a critical part of a gentleman’s apparel is clearly asking to be mangled.” Say what you want, Bill Bryson, but English is actually ridiculously easy. Not that I’m perfect in it, but still, compared to other languages, it’s a piece of cake. Even with those pesky indefinite and definite articles — I’ll still take those over conjugations and declensions and all that other stuff English seems to have just shrugged off to everyone’s benefit. The spelling — well, if seven-year-old Nataliya was able to get past the sheer mortification of spelling “cat” as “kat” in her first English class in school, so can everyone else. “Language, never forget, is more fashion than science, and matters of usage, spelling, and pronunciation tend to wander around like hemlines.” Languages evolve naturally, sometimes slowly and sometimes unexpectedly fast, with everything contributing to that, even misspellings and misunderstandings. Spelling can follow pronunciation, but then we also have pronunciation change due to new spelling fads (like adding “t” to “often” and “b” to “debt”). The origins of English are basically a mishmash of so many influences, and I never get tired of all the anecdotes and Bryson-style tangents. What I love is that Bryson is not a self-appointed grammarian and is quite clear about his views on the completely arbitrary grammar conventions that have no basis whatsoever other than some stuffy pedant deciding on a way to separate the elite from the plebs. After all, “Considerations of what makes for good English or bad English are to an uncomfortably large extent matters of prejudice and conditioning.” “So if there are no officially appointed guardians for the English language, who sets down all those rules that we all know about from childhood—the idea that we must never end a sentence with a preposition or begin one with a conjunction, that we must use each other for two things and one another for more than two, and that we must never use hopefully in an absolute sense, such as “Hopefully it will not rain tomorrow”? The answer, surprisingly often, is that no one does, that when you look into the background of these “rules” there is often little basis for them.” And so I will happily go on starting my sentences with “And…” and ending them with prepositions while splitting every infinitive I can possibly find. “I can think of two very good reasons for not splitting an infinitive. 1. Because you feel that the rules of English ought to conform to the grammatical precepts of a language that died a thousand years ago. 2. Because you wish to cling to a pointless affectation of usage that is without the support of any recognized authority of the last 200 years, even at the cost of composing sentences that are ambiguous, inelegant, and patently contorted.” Image borrowed from The Jenkins comic strip here: https:\/\/thejenkinscomic.wordpress.com... . I do adore reading about British and American English differences — hey, our linguistic peculiarities here in the US are because we held on to saying things like “gotten” that the Brits have since forgotten. We are charming this way, I suppose. (And those poor 18th century public US figures had to dejectedly apologize to those Brits about Americanisms. Hey, without us you’d still be using “gyratory circuses” instead of roundabouts. But sadly, despite what we’d love to think, Shakespeare - or perhaps Shakspere - did not sound like an Appalachian farmer). “Sometimes these differences in meaning take on a kind of bewildering circularity. A tramp in Britain is a bum in America, while a bum in Britain is a fanny in America, while a fanny in Britain is—well, we’ve covered that. To a foreigner it must seem sometimes as if we are being intentionally contrary.” ———— Arguably America’s single greatest gift to international discourse, O.K. is the most grammatically versatile of words, able to serve as an adjective (“Lunch was O.K.”), verb (“Can you O.K. this for me?”), noun (“I need your O.K. on this”), interjection (“O.K., I hear you”), and adverb (“We did O.K.”). It can carry shades of meaning that range from casual assent (“Shall we go?” “O.K.”), to great enthusiasm (“O.K.!”), to lukewarm endorsement (“The party was O.K.”), to a more or less meaningless filler of space (“O.K., can I have your attention please?”). Bill Bryson is funny and very enthusiastic, sometimes overwhelmingly so, but it’s very endearing. This book is not a scholarly work by any means but rather a bunch of anecdotes told in such a manner that you just can’t stop reading (or listening on a few long hikes in my case). I’m a sucker for such enthusiastic sincere humor, so it was right up my alley. And even though some things are clearly a bit dated in information and attitudes (the book was published in 1990), it didn't spoil the experience for me. “Perhaps for our last words on the subject of usage we should turn to the last words of the venerable French grammarian Dominique Bonhours, who proved on his deathbed that a grammarian’s work is never done when he turned to those gathered loyally around him and whispered: “I am about to—or I am going to—die; either expression is used.” For a more scholarly approach I do highly advise reading David Crystal ’s books, which I do plan to reread, actually, but for a fun diversion for a few hours Bryson is good. 3.5 stars."

I'm what you might call a big fan of language. A dabbler. Certainly not an expert. But boy, did I find this book infuriating. My problem with this book is that it gets so much right, and so much wrong. The example that really set me off was his treatment of the Welsh language. To Bryson, Welsh is \"as unpronounceable as it looks\", and Welsh pronunciations \"rarely bear much relation to their spellings.\" He then spouts off with a series of jokes that are so ethnocentric and condescending that, if you took them at face value, you couldn't help but feel sorry for the poor backward speakers of silly old Welsh. The problem is, he's completely wrong. I happened to study the phonology and orthography of Welsh for about a week in that freshman linguistics class (I know, that makes me a big authority, right?) but in that week I learned something Bryson apparently never bothered to look up: Welsh orthography is remarkably regular, about as regular as Spanish. It's not at all difficult if you bother to learn the rules, which are far simpler than those of English. (The fact that I learned them in one week, and remember them decades later, should be some indication of how easy they are.) The phoneme represented by the double-l is called a lateral fricative, and yes, it's hard to pronounce if you don't speak Welsh, but that does not mean it's sometimes pronounced \"kl\" and other times \"thl\" as Bryson suggests. It is always pronounced just like it's spelled. But Bryson's Anglo-American tin ear failed to pick that up, and he took his ignorance and turned it into a cheap joke at another culture's expense. Knowing that he got Welsh so wrong made me doubt all of the rest of the information in the book. And that's a real shame, because it covers such fascinating topics, and it's so very entertainingly written. But it's hard to enjoy Bryson's jokes when you have this nagging suspicion that he's bending the truth for the sake of a snappy punchline."

This was the cause of the eternal chagrin of my mother who, being a staunch nationalist, wanted me to prefer Hindi over English. She recited to me a famous couplet in Malayalam, which said: \"Other languages are merely nannies; For man, the native tongue is the mother.\" I replied that in that case, Malayalam is my mother, and both Hindi and English are nannies. And I just happened to prefer my English nanny over my native one. She had no answer to that! Well, I am glad I stuck to English over Hindi, because this is one crazy nanny - totally idiosyncratic and eccentric, just like me. And to tell you how eccentric, who better than Bill Bryson? If you approach this book hoping for a scholarly analysis of the English language, you are going to be sorely disappointed. For that don't come to old Bill.

The origin and spread of English 2. The evolution of words 3. Pronunciation 4. Spelling 5. The varieties of English, both inside the UK and outside 6. Dictionaries and their producers 7. Where names come from 8. Profanity 9. Wordplay ... and much more. There is not a single boring sentence. You are guaranteed to be snickering throughout."

I started this with enthusiasm and was enjoying his breezy style until it occurred to me that a lot of what he was saying seemed to be anecdotal. You know, limited or no research. Then I thought, well, it was written more than 25 years ago, so things that sounded like old stories to me may have been new stories then – like this one: “The Eskimos, as is well known, have fifty words for types of snow—though curiously no word for just plain snow. To them there is crunchy snow, soft snow, fresh snow, and old snow, but no word that just means snow.” There’s a wealth of articles about this half-truth (I’m being generous). Here’s one http:\/\/www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca... So how many grains of salt would I need to swallow the declaration that immediately followed? An unhealthy amount, I’m sure. “The Italians, as we might expect, have over 500 names for different types of macaroni.” He goes on to say these include “spaghetti and vermicelli.” He obviously means types of pasta . Then he got into some languages I have a smattering of myself – French and German—and I began questioning. Some of it just sounded wrong, like the quote from an article that says most speakers of other languages aren’t aware there is such a thing as a thesaurus. At this point, I decided I’d read some reviews to see if anyone who knows more than I do felt the same way. Sadly, there are a lot. You can check the low-rating reviews on Amazon that actually discuss the many factual errors. I stopped reading, thinking I might accidentally absorb some of the \"facts\" and perpetuate them myself!

It has since been pointed out, repeatedly, that Bryson is wrong in a staggering number of places in this book, and as I went on to read more of his work, I also realized exactly how racist he is. I don't read or recommend his books anymore. Here's my original review from 2006, preserved as an artifact of how I was wrong: Published in 1990, this book is already a little out of date. In its first pages, Bryson reports OED editor Robert Burchfield's theory that American English and British English are drifting apart so rapidly that within two hundred years we won't be able to understand each other. That was a theory made back when cell phones still required a battery the size of an unabridged dictionary, long before the internet became such a large part of the way the world communicates, in a time when you couldn't imagine downloading a British Doctor Who or an American Stargate Atlantis to your iPod. We live in a new world! Unfortunately it's also a world where the Harry Potter books are \"translated\" for American readers, lest we be too confused by the lingo: \"What's this? Harry's eating a biscuit? And wearing a jumper? While battling Fizzolian Snargletoothed Whatsits?! This book is impenetrable!\" JK Rowling aside, with communication technology becoming smaller, cheaper, and more powerful, I think we'll still be able to communicate two hundred years down the line. Bryson eventually disagrees with Burchfield for many of the same reasons, though he was unable to cite the internet as a factor. In that way, this book is showing its age -- the chapter on online language use is, of course, conspicuously absent -- but it's got the history part down. Bryson spends most of his time looking at how we got where we are today. Where English came from, how it got to England, where it went from there. With its in-text references, footnotes, extensive bibliography and index, this book looks almost academic, but Bryson, an American living in England, handles it all with a cheerfully low-key sense of humor -- almost as if Terry Pratchett had turned his eye to grammar -- and even a refreshingly open approach to the word fuck in the chapter on swearing. My one complaint is that, despite being loosely hung on British and American history, for the most part the book lacks a greater structure and ends up reading like a series of interesting facts. But, hell, they got my attention, and, as it happened, the attention of everyone around me: \"Hey! Did you know the Romans had no word for grey ?\" Since English, as this book proves, is a big crazy mess, I guess Bryson can be excused for not being able to wrangle its history into a more pleasing order. Lack of structure aside, I really enjoyed reading this and will be reading more books by Bryson in the future."

For example claiming that the German preposition\/suffix \"auf\" is unusual among foreign words in that it has more than one meaning... anyone who has spent any time learning a language will tell you that all of them have words with dozens of meanings (Except maybe Esperanto?). Furthermore there is no preposition in any language that cannot be translated into at least three or four prepositions in English, nor are there any English prepositions that don't have numerous translations in the other language. That's just how prepositions are! They don't translate! The first chapter of this book has so many mistakes that I couldn't finish it. Almost every sentence has a mistake. It is a collage of newspaper clippings. If you read the credits at the back you'll see that he only consulted newspapers and magazines and did no real research. I can't go through all the mistakes, I really don't have the time, there are just too many. If it continues in this way then this is a work of complete and utter fiction. I loved \"A Short History of Nearly Everything\" and now I am frightened that if I knew anything whatsoever about \"Everything\" I would have found that that book too was filled with amusing but completely made up factoids."

The subject matter is not that hard, so I can only guess \"The Mother Tongue\" was written in such a hurry that you only consulted one or two sources, where it should have been five or six. The history of English is not something you learn from reading one textbook; there is a lot of ongoing research and debate. And most of your sources are a decade or two out of date, even for 1991. Get your facts straight and publish a revised edition is the best advice I can give you. And as for my fellow readers: buy David Crystal's The Stories of English instead. Far better researched and just as entertaining."

        "text":"I'm a longtime fan of Bill Bryson, but I had never read this early nonfiction work of his and was delighted to see that my library had a copy of the audiobook. \"The Mother Tongue\" has the expected rambling charm of a Bryson nonfiction work. When he becomes enamored on a topic (such as the history of our houses in \"At Home\" or the history of our universe in \"A Short History of Nearly Everything\") Bryson digs up all kinds of interesting facts and stories and anecdotes and puts it all together in a delightfully interesting collection of essays. In this book, he discusses the history of the English language, but also the history of languages in general, the history of dictionaries, and many of the odd pronunciations and spellings that are so peculiar to English. Knowing that \"The Mother Tongue\" was published in 1990, I had fun imagining what additions Bryson would have added to the text today, knowing how many new words have been adopted since the Internet took over our world. Overall, this was a pleasant read and is a nice complement to other books that have been written about the English language. Recommended. Opening Passage \"More than 300 million people in the world speak English and the rest, it sometimes seems, try to. It would be charitable to say that the results are sometimes mixed. Consider this hearty announcement in a Yugoslavian hotel: 'The flattening of underwear with pleasure is the job of the chambermaid. Turn to her straightaway.' Or this warning to motorists in Tokyo: 'When a passenger of the foot heave in sight, tootle the horn. Trumpet at him melodiously at first, but if he still obstacles your passage, then tootle him with vigor.' Or these instructions gracing a packet of convenience food from Italy: 'Besmear a backing pan, previously buttered with a good tomato sauce, and, after dispose the cannelloni, lightly distanced between them in a only couch.' Clearly the writer of that message was not about to let a little ignorance of English stand in the way of a good meal. In fact, it would appear that one of the beauties of the English language is that even with the most tenuous grasp you can speak volumes if you show enough enthusiasm — a willingness to tootle with vigor, as it were.\""

Published in 1990, the book was written before Internet changed the way the world communicates and hence a lot of the content regarding the spread of languages is hopelessly outdated by now. Bryson is not a linguist, neither is he a historian. Therefore his attempts to explain the popularity and status of English as the lingua franca of the modern world come off haphazard at best. Bryson's love for his native English is clear enough; so is his painfully obvious lack of knowledge of any other languages. I did not care to keep count of the times he falsely asserts some feature in English cannot be found in any other language or blatantly moves the goalposts to prove how infinitely richer English is compared to anything. For all the little anecdotes and copious bits of trivia it contains, I really want to like the book more than I do. Unfortunately once it becomes clear that many of these factoids won't stand up to closer scrutiny -- Bryson doesn't even blink as he repeats the age-old and very disputed claim that the Eskimos have 50 words for snow -- it becomes hard to believe anything the book claims. The most baffling and outrageous claim of all is the one that strikes closest to home. Bryson has the audacity to suggest we Finns have no native swear words and use the phrase \"in the restaurant\" as a curse instead. Perkele, I say."

However, I for one have generally and usually found Bryson’s general tone of narrational voice and the boastful, arrogant demeanour he constantly seems to present and yes indeed often downright spew in The Mother Tongue: English and How it Got that Way extremely off-putting and really at best massively condescending, with his claims regarding the supposed superiority of the English language both unacademic and yes, profoundly bigoted and stereotyping (and as such of course absolutely devoid of any kind of linguistic acumen and actual bona fide language based knowledge). And albeit granted that English is at present a so-called and even aptly labelled world language, the reasons why English is such, the reasons why English is so profoundly popular and globally strong at present are NOT (at least in in my humble opinion) due to any type of linguistic superiority, they are primarily and simply cultural and historic in nature and also have much to do with economics and not with English being in any manner a better and superior language linguistically speaking than French, German, Chinese, Russian and so on and so on. And quite frankly, Mr. Bryson (and if you are perhaps offended by this, sorry, but I really and truly care not), your considerations about English and that you somehow think and assume the language is somehow better, is supposedly more advanced and of higher quality than other languages, this attitude truly makes me as a person of German background cringe profoundly, as it so strongly and uncomfortably does tend to remind me of the type of rhetoric that was used in the Third Reich by Adolf Hitler and his ilk to claim and attempt to demonstrate that German (that the Germanic languages) were supposedly both linguistically and genetically superior and more advanced than other language groups and families. However, languages are simply languages and in my opinion (and actually in the opinion of many if not most academically trained linguists worth considering) NO language is thus in any manner and in any way superior and those who attempt to claim this (especially if they are categorical and unilateral in and with their philosophies) are at best profoundly naive and at worst downright and frighteningly dangerous and full of propaganda. One star (and really, with The Mother Tongue: English and How it Got that Way , I actually almost wish I could give less than one star, and I have since reading or should I say since attempting to peruse this book actively shied away from trying any more offerings from Bill Bryson's pen, his seeming general popularity notwithstanding, especially and in particular since many of the \"facts\" the author has cited to cement his claims that English as a language is supposedly somehow superior to and of better and more lasting quality than other world languages are academically wrong anyhow, are not the truth or only partially the truth, and for a non-fiction linguistic tome, this just is not in any way even remotely acceptable)."

Well, a sample of two is not enough to go on, apparently because this turned out disappointing, for two primary reasons: 1. It was first published in 1990 and it has not aged well. Some statistics are well out of date, Bryson using a figure of 56 million for the population of Britain, with 60 million more accurate at the time I write, for example. The political position has moved on, too. 2. Errors and inconsistencies. Some statements are just plain wrong. At one point Bryson says that the Irish Prime Minister's title sounds like \"tea-sack\" when rendered into phonetic English spelling. This is just incoorect; it is more like \"tea-shock\" even \"tea-shop\" if one was not listening attentively. Bryson says that the six Celtic languages arose from one predecessor called Celtic. Every other source I've read uses the term Brythonic for this extinct predecessor. It's possible that philologists have changed their terminology and don't use the term \"Brythonic\" any more (just as they don't call themselves philologists anymore) but even if that is so, later Bryson suggests that Welsh is a Gaelic language, which no authority is going to agree with. As far as inconsistencies go, two stick with me: First Bryson tacitly identifies himself with Britain in the early part of the book, then later on as American...perhaps not surprising considering his Pond hoping tendencies. The second is worse; in the chapter on American accents and dialects he starts by agreeing that the USA shows less regional variation than britain and ends suggesting that there is, in fact, one dialect per person.... The effect of these two problems is to, one way or another, call into question the validity of just about everything expressed as a statement of fact, unless one already knows of an independent authority who agrees. This is most unfortunate, as the topic is fascinating and the writing is witty, though sometimes angry; English is also emotive!"

It is similar with how history's made, there were wars, migrations, proliferation of mass media, the making of dictionaries, public figures making their own linguistic marks (and complete fools of themselves), class and regional divisions, and so on and so forth. Bryson is a funny guy. I think I have read at least two of his works previously and he never disappoints in making me chuckled or even roaring with laughter. True, there was a stultifying effect of him becoming too enthusiastic with his many, many examples, when he already made his points. That's my biggest gripe from reading this novel. Nevertheless, the book itself is a bundle of joy of finding invariably humorous take on how word changed - even corrupted - over the course of time. It is amusing to know people made mistakes and those mistakes held on until today. It made me wonder, though, since English is very much a dynamic language co-created together by the whole world depending on the generation, how much it will change in the next 100 years? We know that the Oxford Dictionary added \"twerk\", \"derp\" and \"selfie\" back in 2013 (which caused quite a bit of uproar), and in June 2017 alone, there are at least 100 new words. With the growing invasion of foreign and urbandictionary.com words, would English become the One True Lingua Franca? As for Indonesia, English speakers should feel more at home here (at least in the urban areas) in the next decade or more, with all these millennials\/gen-zs at the malls talking rather fluent English for their daily conversation. English book fairs are always loaded with people (and bloody, thieving online shops). I just hope the rest of the country can keep up with developing their skill. But I also hope that these fluent young speakers do not forget their own language."

I've never heard that expression, but I've sure heard a whole plethora of other fascinating swear words depicting all manner of hell, damnation, and body parts. After all, \"perkele, saatana, vittu\" are the first three words most foreigners learn and particularly the last one (female body part) is sprinkled into conversation as filler, much like the German word \"aber\". So that's when the whole book fell apart for me, because if he couldn't get this part right, what other things might he have been wrong about? Earlier I had thought it fascinating that Lithuanian is one of the oldest European languages. I doubt it now. The book is entertaining and goes a long way to explain how English is spoken in so many parts of the world, much more so than Portuguese, another colonial language.

They can breathe and swallow at the same time. No possibility of food going down the wrong way. With Homo sapiens, food and drink must pass over the larynx on the way to the gullet. Constant risk that some of it will be inhaled. The larynx descends in humans between the age of 3 and 5 months, the exact age when Sudden Infant Death occurs. But the descended larynx explains why we can speak and our pets cannot. That ability to speak made such a difference in our evolution. The word \"pease\" in \"pease porridge hot\" was singular. But people thought it was plural, so \"pea\" back then formed as a singular. In \"Pippa Passes,\" Robert Browning uses the word \"twat,\" which meant the same thing then as it does now, but he did not realize it. He thought it was a nun's hat instead of a nun's. . . .well, you know. Although English is a Germanic language, we have borrowed fewer words from German than almost any language. No one has any idea how the word \"dog\" came to replace the word \"hound.\" Gutenberg may have gotten more credit than he deserves for inventing the printing press. He learned of the process when an apprentice of Laurens Koster ran off with some of his blocks. Well meaning people added \"b\" to \"doubt\" and \"debt\" to keep it more like the Latin. Same with the \"p\" in \"receipt.\" The last words of French grammarian Dominique Bonhours: \"I am about to--or I am going to--die; either expression is used.\" Noah Webster produced a sanitized version of the Bible. In it, men have \"peculiar members\" instead of testicles, and women do not have wombs or anything else with which to contribute to the reproductive process. Such a fear of the human body. Where does it come from? The Oxford English Dictionary insists that Shakespeare should be spelled Shakspere. They add that the commonest spelling \"is perh. Shakespeare.\" Bryson adds \"it cert. is.\" The last name Bush came from wine merchants always having a bush by the front door. Goldwater was a synonym for urine. He has a great list of place names from America, including Maggie's Nipples, Wyoming. In 1970 under test conditions, Roy Dean solved the London Times crossword puzzle in 3 minutes and 45 seconds. An unbelievable feat. Alfred Butts invented the game Scrabble in 1931. He insisted on two of each letter, so q, j, and z can be a problem. He deliberately depressed the number of s's. He increased the number of i's to encourage the use of suffixes. The highest score in 1987 was 3,881 points. It included the word psycholoanalyzing for 1,539 points. A list of anagrams: Ronald Wilson Reagan = Insane Anglo Warlord Spiro Agnew = Grow a Penis two plus eleven = one plus twelve Western Union = No Wire Unsent circumstantial evidence = can ruin a selected victim funeral = real fun The Morse Code = Here come dots mother-in-law = woman Hitler Victoria, England's Queen = governs a nice quiet land William Shakespeare = We all make his praise In Chinese, to call someone a turtle is the worst possible taunt.

And I liked this one too, but unfortunately not as much as In a Sunburned Country . And there are several reasons for that. Including the one that it can be at least partly my fault. And that's what I will start with. I am not an English native speaker. I have never lived in any English-speaking country. I have been learning English at school. I manage pretty well, I can read books in English without too much difficulty. Which does not change the fact that there are a lot of words that I do not know (and I'm fully aware of that). I am also not particularly sensitive to differences in pronunciation between British and American English. I mean, I'm aware of these differences (I am usually able to recognize an American and a British when I hear them), but I do not think I can pronounce the word first according to one and then according to the other pronunciation. I read this book in English and I must admit that although it is very interesting, as a non-English speaker, I was not able to fully appreciate it and understand it. On the other hand, as a foreigner who had to learn English (and I’m native in non-Roman language), Bryson's insight in this area was particularly interesting and accurate for me. Especially when it comes to intricate English pronunciation. So a big plus for that. Another issue, Bryson wrote his book in the late 1980s. The world has changed a lot since then. First of all, we have internet, which, at least in my opinion, makes British and American English even closer to each other and more similar. That is why the book seemed to be slightly outdated at times. I would love to read its modernized version. The above list of imperfections does not mean that I did not like the book. Just like always, it's easier for me to specify what I was not delighted with than what I like. And I must admit that this is a very good book. However, I think that it is directed primarily to English native speakers, because they will be able to capture and better understand all the issues that the author raises. Anyway, this is definitely not my last book by Bill Bryson. I can not wait to read another of his books. This time may be travel related."

It's true that there are a thousand interesting things to encounter in the history of the English language, replete as it is with situations of language contact. I think what bothers me most is the very thinly veiled \"linguo\"centrism that turns it from a piece of enthusiastic writing about the English language into a poorly-argued case for why English is better than every other language on the planet.

His view about machine translation is way out-of-date. He talks about a giant Chinese keyboard, which in fact never caught on. The Wubi method, invented in 1986, encodes Chinese characters by the five shapes of strokes and converts them to alphabetic characters on a generic keyboard. It gained popularity before being replaced by the Intelligent Pinyin method, which facilitates the standard phonetic representation of Chinese characters. Of course, Bill Bryson couldn't have foreseen how the Internet would change English (it would be interesting to know). He certainly loves English. On the dying of Irish (as a language), he says: \"we naturally lament the decline of these languages, but it's not an altogether undiluted tragedy. Consider the loss to English literature, if Joyce, Shaw, Swift, Yeats, Wilde, and Ireland's other literary masters have written in what inescapably a fringe language, their work will be as little known to us as those poets in Iceland or Norway, and that would be a tragedy indeed. No country has given the word incomparable literature per head of population than Ireland, and for that reason alone we might be excused to a small, \"selfish\" celebration that English was the language of her greatest writers.\" This is a hindsight bias. Nevertheless, it's a fun read. I've learned a lot. Maoris of New Zealand have 35 words for dung. The Arabs have 6000 words for camels and camel equipment. The aborigines of Tasmania have a word for every type of trees but no word for the concept of tree. The word \"nice\" meant \"stupid and foolish\" in 1290. In the next 700 years, its meaning has changed so many times that it is impossible to tell what sense Jane Austen intended when she wrote to a friend: \"You scold me so much in a nice long letter which I have received from you.\" The differences between American English and British English make me laugh! The history of swear words is fascinating. \"Bloody\" was worse than the F-word? And those Victorian sensibilities! Who knew the biggest contribution of American English to the language was actually \"OK\"! I agree that the many native English speakers don't bother to learn a second language. After reading this book, I decide to be less harsh on my own accent."

        "text":"Mother Tongue: The English Language , by Bill Bryson, London: Penguin Books, 1990 (link is to a different, in-print edition). Summary: This amusing and informative book surveys the history of the English language and all its vagaries and perplexities of word origins, spellings, and pronunciations and why it has become so successful as a world language . Has it every occurred to you how many different meanings there are for the word fly ? It can be an insect, a means of travel, a verb form of \"to flee\", something a fisherman ties, one of the results of a batter hitting a baseball, or something no man wants open in public. As in so many of Bryson's books, he had me at the opening page as he explored some of the perplexities of our language that native speakers negotiate almost without thought. He had me in the first chapter as he proposed that part of the success of the language is the incredible richness of vocabulary (at the time of publication, the OED had 615,000 words), flexibility of usage, and relative simplicity, particularly in comparison to tonal languages of rendering the language in print. He surveys the history of language, the world's language families and where English is situated in the Indo-European stream, and all the other offshoots, some which are no longer living languages. He recounts the triumph of Anglo-Saxon language over Celtic (even though many of England's place names preserve their Celtic roots), the impact of the Norman invasion (of 10,000 words, approximately 3\/4ths are still in use including much of the language of nobility (duke, baron prince) and much language of jurisprudence (justice, jury, prison among others). He explores the different ways words are created, sometimes by doing nothing! His discussion of pronunciation and particularly the shifts in vowel sounds was fascinating, For example house was once pronounced hoose. You weren't born in a barn but barn in a born. Then there is the matter of spelling and the role of printing and dictionaries in bring a greater if not complete uniformity to spelling--is it ax or axe , judgment or judgement (it is fascinating that the spell check in this word processor highlighted the latter of these two, and yet both are accepted with the shortened forms preferred). Of course so much of this discussion is the concern of some to promote the good and proper use of the language, and yet what is fascinating is the shifting ideas through history of what this is, according to Bryson. Similarly, we have the divergences between New World and Old and some wonder whether American English will become a distinct language. Bryson's concluding chapters explore the origins of proper names, our propensity for wordplay, and the history of what are now considered vulgarities (although I think since Bryson wrote, what was censored in from public media in my youth is becoming more and more common). What is fascinating is that many of these were once in common parlance in Chaucer and Shakespeare. Equally fascinating are our various forms of wordplay, the ultimate of which must be the palindrome where a sentence says the same thing forwards and backwards (an example from the book: \"A man, a plan, a canal, Panama.\") Anyone who writes can understand the challenges of finding the right rather than the almost right word, and how easy it is to think you are saying one thing only to be understood by others as saying the opposite. I found Bryson's book a delightful diversion that better helped me understand both the joy of using this language and the frustrations of rendering the conceptions of mind into words that communicate."

        "text":"Mother Tongue: Essays on the Origins and Usage of English My wife was lent this book by a British friend of ours, but I decided to read it as I've heard about Bill Bryson's popular travel books like Notes from a Small Island and book A Brief History of Everything, about his travels through England before moving back to the US after a long time in his adopted home. He's an interesting guy who grew up in Des Moines, Iowa, became a popular travel writer, and was even Chancellor of prestigious Durham University in the UK. So he's very much a bicultural American-Brit who can see different aspects of both societies from the inside and outside, and also has a wide-ranging intellect and deft sense of humor. Mother Tongue is a series of essays on the origins of human language, with plenty of interesting scientific insights, then to the messy origins of English amid the various waves of invasions of the original Celtic peoples of Britain by Angles, Saxons, Jutes, Normans, Scandinavians (Vikings), and so forth, to its growing status as a global language. I enjoyed this part of the book the most, learning a lot about the origins of the language that was especially useful now that I live in England myself. I also didn't know that Latin evolved into French, Spanish, and Italian among other languages, to my embarrassment. Given the many travels we've had through Europe in the past two years, a lot of the early origins of the Celtic peoples in Europe and the migrations of various peoples across the continent and to the British isles during the Stone, Bronze, and Iron Ages is really fascinating stuff. The middle portion of the book gets very involved in examining the evolution of English spellings and pronunciations as it moved from Old English to Modern English, and the further hiving off of American English from British English. Some of this was really illuminating, but the parts discussing the minute details of spelling and grammatical shifts were slow-going unless you are truly a student of the language and I found somewhat less interesting. The chapter on swearing was quite funny, there's plenty to learn there. And throughout the book Bryson's humor makes the subject matter interesting. However, though he does make regular references to other languages, the book is by its nature extremely English-centric so many of the statements about how unique English is are almost certainly inaccurate as he is not so authoritative a linguist so much as a very well-informed enthusiast. The book's 1990 publication also betrays its age as it is hopelessly out of date when describing how absurdly impractical the computer keyboards are for Chinese and Japanese users and how that has hindered their economic development. Can't blame a book for being out of date, so it's actually somewhat amusing to see how things can change so much in just a few decades. I'm looking forward to reading A Brief History of Everything next before moving onto his well-liked travel stories."

        "text":"Why was this book even published? There are so many errors, inaccuracies, misconceptions, misunderstandings and whatnot, I don't even know where to begin. (And I'm not even a linguist.) All of this makes me question all the other \"facts\" I don't know anything about, I simply don't know if I've learned more about them from reading this book. The Acknowledgements of the book mentions several people, but I hope for their sake that he didn't follow their advice. Otherwise they should receive a dishonorable mention and be out of work. I give it one star because Bill Bryson writes well. Review part I: Bringing science to the people, Bill Bryson style, is always funny and edcuational. However, this book is old, (it was written before the Wall came down, which is evident in the mentioning of the number of citizens of the Soviet Union who don't speak Russian) and a lot has happened in the lingustic field since then. So I'm not sure the information is always correct. Until I find out, I will simply enjoy the book as is :-) One curious thing: Norwegians supposedly \"talk about departing like an Englishman\" (p7) Eh, really? Never heard of that. Googling it, I find only quotes from this book. Update: Not sure I'll finish this book. I was worried it'd be outdated, but that's only part of the problem. There are so many inaccuracies, facts that are not facts at all and some Bryson attitude issues. I've mentioned the Norwegian example above and other Goodreads reviews mentions that, according to this book, mordern Finnish has no swear words (!) and Bryson's understanding of (to him) foreign languages like Japanese and German leads to wrong or not quite accurate conclusions. Also quotes like \"As of 1989, the Basque separatist organization ETA ... had committed 672 murders in the name of linguistic and cultural independence\" (p35) is rather particular, to say the least. His rant about funny Welsh spelling and pronounciation is silly. (p36) In some languages, like Spanish, spelling and pronounciation are almost the same, in other languages, like Danish and apparantly Welsh, they are not. Also, the pronounciation of a specific language is difficult or easy according to your own mother tongue. German to me is easy, Japanese is difficult. A book like this should acknowledge these things."

        "text":"As a language lover, The Mother Tongue is fun and informative. I read this for my college rhetoric class, and fell in love with the enjoyable read with knowledge worthy of an upper level college English class. Bryson's true gift is in making the nature of linguistics both understandable and relevant. The author has fun playing with words - I laughed out loud multiple times. The best chapter is the one on what is considered obscene language, not because it feels good to curse, but because it increases your cultural awareness and empathy to think about how a conquering nation determines what words are proper and what words are vile. It might make you think twice before you correct the way someone speaks with a regional dialect. Bryson isn't about prescriptive grammar and language elitism, but about exploring the nature of human communication. Should we really isolate someone because they speak differently than we do? Language is a natural and essential aspect of the human condition and the more you know about language evolution and acquisition, the more you should appreciate the diversity of successful communications."

Bryson is a funny man and a witty writer and this book ranges from the first recorded sentence in English - \"This she-wolf is a reward to my kinsman\" - to Cockney rhyming slang, though palindromes, anagrams and the politics of spelling. Recommended to anyone with any interest in our weird, wonderful, ever-evolving mother tongue."

        "text":"With ten stories from various authors and genres I'm betting you'll find at least something you like in A Changeling For All Seasons, and may even discover a few things you didn’t realize you enjoyed until now. I know I did. Angela Knight - A Vampire Christmas Picture walking into your home feeling on top of the world knowing your sexy fiancé is waiting with open arms. Only you open the door and instead of the loving man you expected you get a bloodthirsty creature. This is exactly what happens to Amelia. She had no idea what happened, she only knew was that life would never be normal again. I really did enjoy this story because you frequently read about falling in love with a supernatural, but it is rare to read about a character having someone they love changing and having to choose whether to leave them or accept them. One thing I did wish I got more of was David's POV. It was hard to follow the relationship development because I just didn’t know enough about his character to understand his actions. In the end though everything worked itself out and Amelia may not have ended up with the life she dreamed of, but she got one equally rewarding. Sahara Kelly - A Christmas Pageant Joey and Marty sitting in a tree... but they are doing way more that kissing. I really enjoyed this story. It played nicely off of a schoolboy fantasy, which most readers can appreciate. Marty desperately needed change to get past the rut in his life, and Joey definitely changed things for him. All he has to do is get her out of that skimpy outfit and into his bed. Judy Mays - Jingle Balls With a name like Jingle Balls this story has got to be good! Then I started reading it and thought to myself “Uh oh, this is some cheesy play off of Christmas”. Well I should have gone with my original thought because turns out it was good. By the time they made it to the club scene I was sold. The relationship development while a little slow to start but after a while really drew me in. Richard and Jessica definitely do complement each other well including both of their tempers. It seems both characters can go off at any given moment so I know their relationship will be one interesting ride. And yes I even enjoyed the cheesy play off of Christmas. Marteeka Karland - Sealed With A Kiss We have moved from Christmas to Valentine’s Day. I have to admit I have mix feeling about this story. The relationship develop for me was good, but the overall plot of the story just seemed as if it was missing something. I would have liked just a little more excitement or conflict. I prefer a more complex plot, but the relationship itself was good. I liked that it was almost a competition between Marie and Daxon on who could seduce who first. Plus in this relationship you can see the emotional development without being told about it, which I liked. All-in-all it was a story I enjoyed reading. Kate Douglas - My Valentine Ginny is my favorite character within this anthology so far. She suffered greatly in her life and deserved a shot at happiness. Her happiness is in the form of St. Valentine and, as appropriate to the holiday, he sweeps her off her feet and warms her heart and soul in an attempt to show her what life and living should be. This is a short story I can see myself reading over again and still getting that warm fuzzy feeling in my heart every time. Shelby Morgen – Changeling Now it's time for St. Patrick’s day and where better to celebrate than Ireland! This story was an interesting one since we start with Michael, a none believer in all things magical, but drunk enough to explore anyway. I liked the way the relationship between Arien and Michael unraveled especially the twist of them being together. One thing I was disappointed by was the end of the story. I would have liked to have seen a more definitive conclusion, but regardless, I consider this another lovely story. Willa Okati - Elven Enchantment I absolutely adored this story. Ciara had some crappy luck with men until she walks into a bar. Even though there was a band the real show was the two guys who couldn’t keep their hands off each other -- a far better show, and Ciara thought so, too. Even more fun was when Seanan and Ardal invite Ciara for a night of unimaginable pleasure. Who wouldn't jump at the change to join Blondie and Dark & Delicious? Everything about this story was perfect from beginning to end, and I would love to see more of these lovable characters. Kate Hill - Jolene's Pooka Another great story riveted with myth and lore. Larkin is really the stand out character in this story. Athough he came off a little too arrogant and dominant for me, knowing what he is really helps me understand why he acts that way. Apparently it is just what Jolene needs because she falls into his bed, and refuses to leave once she realized how much fun it was. I don't know if the legend of the pooka is true, but I'm sold and would love for one to show up at in front of my house. I wonder if they travel to the city? Lacey Savage - Chemistry to Burn While the beginning of this story confused me a bit I quickly figured out what was going on. Some men will go to any length to get a girl's attention. Griffin is no exception; he refused to play second fiddle to Angelina’s research so he came up with an infallible plan to fix that problem. But he soon realized he may have made a big mistake. I actually liked Griffin once I got to know him, he isn’t as bad of a guy that Angelina thought he was. Griffin, go get your girl and refuse to accept no for an answer! Shelby Morgen - Troll Under The Bridge This story was short enough the characters were able to be fairly anonymous, only going by Troll and Cop. I think this was a nice little encounter at the end of this anthology. The twist at the end made it interesting. This was the shortest story within the anthology so there really wasn’t room for error and the author made sure there were none. All in all I would have to say this was good anthology. I think that it had a nice theme that it continued from beginning to end and while each story was different they complemented each other. As a paranormal erotica fan I was able to read about fairies, shifters, trolls, vampires and other creatures. I discovered some new authors that I would love to read more stories by, which is always a plus and one of the reasons I have always enjoyed anthologies. So I would say, go ahead and read this anthology -- you might be surprised by the creatures you bump into. Originally posted at http:\/\/whippedcream2.blogspot.com\/201..."

This is a short story I can see myself reading over again and still getting that warm fuzzy feeling in my heart every time. Shelby Morgen – Changeling Now it's time for St. Patrick’s day and where better to celebrate than Ireland! This story was an interesting one since we start with Michael, a none believer in all things magical, but drunk enough to explore anyway. I liked the way the relationship between Arien and Michael unraveled especially the twist of them being together. One thing I was disappointed by was the end of the story. I would have liked to have seen a more definitive conclusion, but regardless, I consider this another lovely story. Willa Okati - Elven Enchantment I absolutely adored this story. Ciara had some crappy luck with men until she walks into a bar. Even though there was a band the real show was the two guys who couldn’t keep their hands off each other -- a far better show, and Ciara thought so, too. Even more fun was when Seanan and Ardal invite Ciara for a night of unimaginable pleasure. Who wouldn't jump at the change to join Blondie and Dark & Delicious? Everything about this story was perfect from beginning to end, and I would love to see more of these lovable characters. Kate Hill - Jolene's Pooka Another great story riveted with myth and lore. Larkin is really the stand out character in this story. Athough he came off a little too arrogant and dominant for me, knowing what he is really helps me understand why he acts that way. Apparently it is just what Jolene needs because she falls into his bed, and refuses to leave once she realized how much fun it was. I don't know if the legend of the pooka is true, but I'm sold and would love for one to show up at in front of my house. I wonder if they travel to the city? Lacey Savage - Chemistry to Burn While the beginning of this story confused me a bit I quickly figured out what was going on. Some men will go to any length to get a girl's attention. Griffin is no exception; he refused to play second fiddle to Angelina’s research so he came up with an infallible plan to fix that problem. But he soon realized he may have made a big mistake. I actually liked Griffin once I got to know him, he isn’t as bad of a guy that Angelina thought he was. Griffin, go get your girl and refuse to accept no for an answer! Shelby Morgen - Troll Under The Bridge This story was short enough the characters were able to be fairly anonymous, only going by Troll and Cop. I think this was a nice little encounter at the end of this anthology. The twist at the end made it interesting. This was the shortest story within the anthology so there really wasn’t room for error and the author made sure there were none. All in all I would have to say this was good anthology. I think that it had a nice theme that it continued from beginning to end and while each story was different they complemented each other. As a paranormal erotica fan I was able to read about fairies, shifters, trolls, vampires and other creatures. I discovered some new authors that I would love to read more stories by, which is always a plus and one of the reasons I have always enjoyed anthologies. So I would say, go ahead and read this anthology -- you might be surprised by the creatures you bump into. Originally posted at http:\/\/whippedcream2.blogspot.com\/201..."

    "desc":"Warren Buffett once memorably described derivatives as \"financial weapons of mass destruction\". Read this sensational and controversial account of the often dazzling business of derivatives trading, and see if you agree. No money is ever really made in financial markets. Markets merely transfer wealth. As to how to make money? Well, it is basically theft, misrepresentation, lies, cheating, deception or force. It is impossible to make the staggering amounts made in derivatives in good years honestly. Traders, Guns & Money is a wry and wickedly comic exposé of the culture, games, and pure deceptions played out every day in trading rooms around the world, usually with other people's money. Whether you move in the financial world yourself, know people who do, or have money invested in stocks, shares or derivatives, this is a fascinating read guaranteed to make you think.",

        "text":"All but a few financial storytellers fall short in comparison with Michael Lewis. Satyajit Dasis is no exception. Like the others who failed, he was not Lewis-like enough to carry the narrative. On the plus side, I give Das credit for his clear explanations of the many derivative products that are out there today. Let’s award points, too, for his title, even though the book couldn’t quite live up to the humor it was meant to project. As for the shortcomings, the worst, I thought, was the short shrift he gave to the more human elements. Lewis can get you involved with the people – smart or naïve, honest or corrupt, successful or beaten to a pulp. You want to know what happens to them in the unfolding story. Your understanding is helped by the fact that whole messy business has been personalized. With Das, it’s more just a laundry list of the financial products and recycled press accounts of famous meltdowns. Whenever he does involve people, they’re either fictitious stick figures or categories of investment subspecies lumped together a little too conveniently into bins of disrepute. I’m sure he has a point when he says many of today’s financial instruments can postpone tax bills, shift risks to less savvy clients, and obfuscate product deliverables, but in my mind he overplayed his cynicism and lost credibility in the process. Not all M&A activity is cannibalism, not all derivatives were created to dupe someone, and not all people in the industry are crooked. He weakens his case when he implies as much."

        "text":"Das, a derivatives and risk expert, takes a very snarky look at these complex products that exploded the financial world in 2008 (though he is writing in 2006). Few people understand them, but whenever investors are flush with cash, money has to end up somewhere, and it's often seeking the highest return. The quants who create them may understand the equations, but not the real world consequences. The salespeople who sell them don't really understand them, and the buyers - in a system ruled by asymmetric information, where the seller always knows more than the buyer - rarely ever do. Although not as dull or abstruse as a textbook, which Das also writes, this book does go into the weeds, and readers who have no knowledge whatsoever of derivatives will find themselves floating on a sea of mysterious acronyms, coupled with diagrams and flow charts. Das keeps it punchy with chapterette headings such as \"Rough Trade,\" \"Bondage,\" \"Dukes of Hazard,\" and \"Tranche Warfare.\" He tells us that heading into a trial preparation as a plaintiff's expert witness, where an Indonesian noodle company that had been snookered on some derivatives was suing the issuer, he had looked up Portia's \"quality of mercy\" speech from The Merchant of Venice as a precaution. The book is plagued by typos: missing apostrophes and quotation marks, and astonishingly, a consistent misspelling of Warren Buffett's name. Former Salomon head John Gutfreund is repeatedly referred to as \"John Gutenfreund.\""

        "text":"And you thought a book on derivatives and option trading would be boring. WRONG! How can wiping out the global economy ever be boring? Oh sure, Option Trading is a wonky subject, and I’ve read many a dry book on the subject, but this one breaks the mold. It really does help you understand the mechanics of the derivative world as well as show you real world applications in a hilarious manner. Well, hilarious if you weren’t the one losing all your money in the deal. Or if somehow you weren’t part of the global economy within the last decade. Let me step back at this point. Options. Basically, they’re for farmers. You plant a crop, spend all year tending to it, and need to be certain of a profit. Rather than relying on the weather and gods, you enter a contract. You limit your maximum profit, but put a floor on the downside. The baker does the same… he needs to ensure the price of flour stays low enough to keep his business going down the line. He enters into a buy contract for the farmer’s goods. Simple enough. And sure, why not scale that concept into new industries as well? Think fuel costs for a transportation company… now you’re getting the idea. But here’s the thing. Why shouldn’t Wall Street take advantage of such a simple thing? I mean, little risk and profits from the sale of the contracts. How could these masters of the universe fuck that up? Just like everything else they touch, it’s gotta turn to gold for them. And that’s why this book shines. When you seriously get to the causes behind all the messes caused by these guys, you’ll laugh so hard that you’ll cry. Mostly because a little part of you died on the inside and you were already crying to begin with. But you’ll laugh too! Now, I work on the ass end of this machine, but I’m still an insider. The book made me look around my office and laugh. Then cry. You see, the formula is the same no matter where you go in this industry. A bunch of young know nothings running around selling crap that even their PhD financial quant engineers can’t understand. It’s perfect, the kids, most all who are in their 20s, peddle weapons of mass destruction to anyone dumb enough to buy their bomb. I see it every day at work. Kids ruining client’s people’s retirements because they’re just too stupid to…. Nah, wait, not stupid. They just don’t care. Either way, the stupid\/not caring allows them rack in major paychecks. Wealth is not created by the financial industry, it is simply moved about. Now you’re thinking, “Hey, great idea… let’s get smart people in there instead?” Wrong again, my friend. See, knowing ‘stuff’ in this industry is a bad thing. If you know stuff, you make the salesman feel bad about what they’re doing. This goes up the chain of command too. The author points out how management is based on hitting sales goals instead of skill or experience, because obviously this is a way to run the global economy. But it is. Sure, not everyone is horrid asshole when it comes to this industry, but we’ll never get far enough in this corporate climate to change things. Given the fact that this book was written pre Great Recession, one could almost say it serves as a witty warning of things to come. Too bad that I’m writing this follow up in 2014… because I can tell you first hand that nothing has changed. And it’s not the industries fault. It’s yours. Yep, you know that boring guy you ignored when you tried to talk finance…? Remember how you brought all your money over to the 20 year old who kept blowing smoke up your ass instead?"

(Zero coupon bond worth 106%, call option on my portfolio purchases, they keep a percentage for themselves.) I also learned that I was a sucker for buying into this annuity - except that I was lucky and did it a year before the market drop of 2008. Now if I can just get my 106% out... I was a big fan of Frank Portnoy's Fiasco and this is the geekier version with more finance than most people want to read. The author, Das, also includes stories of derivatives deals which drive home how outmatched most purchasers, no matter how sophisticated they think they are (Fortune 500 CFO's et al), compared to the folks who spend their entire days thinking of novel financial vehicles."

        "text":"A long walk for a medium sized drink that gets warm by the end. This is no Michael Lewis book, which is what I thing most readers desperately want it to be. The reader will be challenged which is good and bad. I have to admit this was one of the hardest books I've ever read as the material is pretty thick. The depth of the subject covered in this book not for a casual audience. I probably now know more than I'll ever want to about derivatives, and more than I probably should about the internal dealings of Wall Street. I agree with the Financial Times assessment from the cover that this is fascinating reading, but only for those who are deeply, deeply interested in the topic. I was pulled in by the title's inclusion of the word \"guns\" as I was hoping for a book similar to \"Confessions of an Economic Hit Man\" by John Perkins. I was looking for more adventure and explosions or something with at least hit of espionage, in fact I don't think a gun ever made an appearance, so I felt suckered by the title. This book really was closer to a text book study of derivatives or at least one man's life story of working in derivative markets on Wall Street, than anything having to do with guns. Though perhaps I just didn't go all in on the metaphor the author was trying to push on the reader. I prefer the analogy that derivatives are closer to WMD's, not guns. The book is a bit more interesting reading in 2015, as it was published in 2006 before the big crash. The author makes many points that you cringe reading in hindsight about just how out of hand things had gotten during the era of his authorship. Many \"shame on us\" moments, but when has that ever stopped us (the American public) before, and doubtful it will stop us in the future. If you are the right audience for this, dive right in, other wise pass on by as it's going to be a long journey."

        "text":"I did learn a few things about derivatives from this book. For example, I had not previously realized how mark to market accounting can be used to inflate profits and traders' bonuses and can lead to margin calls on illiquid top level CDO tranches when the failure of lower tranches causes a ratings downgrade in upper level tranches that would probably actually pay full value if held to maturity, so even if the models were right in predicting tiny risks of default, the accounting rules helped to accelerate the financial crisis. The book does a good job in showing how derivatives can create an economic house of cards rather than having positive value in increasing liquidity and stability. But in trying to be light and humorous, the author frequently becomes too cynical and snarky. And he could have gone a bit deeper than he did in explaining the math and the modeling. Surely it can't all be as much of a shell game as the author suggests, or if it is, I wish that he would have given me a little more substance to reach that conclusion on my own."

I still stand by what I said about the book's tone -- from the punchy three-word title you could recognise it for the way it reads, sort of a stand up comic routine on the derivative markets. The first half wasn't especially compelling, as the castigation of financial professionals is so generalised. You have to be offensive to be funny, I guess. Once you get past that, the second half rocks -- perhaps because I don't take any personal offense, not being involved in derivatives. It's a great insider's view of how and why derivatives evolved, with great and simple (and cynical) explanations of why various structures were created (generally, to evade taxes, get around trading regulations, and other ways to give investors more yield and earn banks more fees). The anecdotes and narrative read like a late-night drink confessional -- probably exaggerated but sounding true enough in essence, and deeply educational. As mentioned previously, it doesn't claim to be a rigorous, comprehensive risk management textbook (which Das has written) so it won't be that sort of educational if that's what you're looking for. But through anecdotes it gives a sharp sense of the culture of the people involved, something you could never find even in very good textbooks."

You probably need a basic understanding of finance and derivatives to enjoy this book because it can get a little technical. I certainly learned a lot more about derivatives after reading this. Some chapters get a little repetitive but overall the book is really interesting. The examples of companies using derivatives to inflate their balances sheets or to comply with EU regulations before a merger just go to show how much craftiness and deception can come from the finance industry.

It is about a trader who worked in the British banking system and his attempt to defend an Indonesian company that blew itself up with derivatives and leverage. The fake names (Nero and Neverfail) that he gives people are just a little too ridiculous. Most of the math that he is trying to explain is excellent. Off-hand, the only numerical error I noticed in this book was a point where I am pretty sure that a number that was supposed to be $1,000 million was written as $1,000 billion. The book does explain things like derivatives and CDOs, but a lot of that went flying over my head. His cynical view of the fail states of various business practices described in either chapter 2 or chapter 3 were hilarious."

Nearly everything banking related that would go wrong in the great recession is talked about in this book, and that makes it an asset.

The Good: First off, the fact that this was written right before the global financial crisis makes it extra interesting. As you read the stories all I could think about is how the derivatives for the GFC were being created. I think The Big Short may have gotten some inspiration from this book. Overall the book is a good read. The stories are humorous, the material is digestible, and it sheds a lot of light on a sector that is often super confusing. Laughed out loud more than I expected for sure. The Bad: You will need some passing familiarity with derivatives to appreciate it properly but most concepts are explained well enough to follow, although you will still get confused here and there. Some parts are certainly more interesting than others. Too many gosh darn grammar and typos."

        "text":"A REVEALING PRE-2008 FINANCIAL CRISIS PORTRAIT OF DERIVATIVES, AND THE INDUSTRY THAT SELLS THEM Sanyajit Das is a financial analyst who had written many books on derivatives and related topics, such as 'Extreme Money: Masters of the Universe and the Cult of Risk,' 'Risk Management and Financial Derivatives,' 'Credit Derivatives, Swap and Derivative Financing,' etc. He has also revised this 2006 book... He wrote in the Preface, \"[This book] is the record of my time in the derivatives industry. It is a collection of tales about the products, the people and the strange goings-on in the business... There is almost no literature that explains the industry in an accessible way. There is also little that sets out the practices, some of which are insane, of this mysterious area of finance. [The book] explains the industry, how it operates and what it does. The book does not attempt to make a case for and against derivatives, it just shows what REALLY goes on every day in the dealing rooms in major financial centers, the real life dramas and rational madness that shape modern markets. [The book] is intended for two audiences. People in banking and finance ... will find it a wry and entertaining read... This book is also for those who want an accessible introduction to this weird and wonderful world. It will perhaps confirm their worst fears and prejudices about these strange instruments, what they are used for and the people who trade them.\" (Pg. xiii) He recalls, \"Many of today's traders hadn't been born when I stumbled accidently into derivatives trading. I had spent over 25 years in this world of traders, guns and money. The traders and money were clear enough. And you couldn't have financial weapons more powerful than derivatives---they were the big guns of the trade... How did I get there? I had followed the money... I had not known very much about derivatives when I started. How did I get here? ... This is that story. It is also coincidentally the story of the rise and rules of derivative trading---its 'knowns' and its 'unknowns.'\" (Pg. 18) He points out, \"The major defender of derivatives was Alan Greenspan, Chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York... The head of the central bank's role as cheerleader for the derivatives lobby was curious.\" (Pg. 20) He recalls, \"We needed 'innovation,' we were told. We created increasingly odd products. These obscure structures allowed us to earn higher margins than the cutthroat vanilla business... New structures that clients actually wanted were not that easy to create... The truth was that we weren't very creative but by golly, we were good at plagiarism. We chased our tails some more.\" (Pg. 41) Later, he adds, \"Survival requires keeping your head down. There was no point in resisting the latest fad. I just nodded and kept doing what I always did---trying to make money. No management fad lasted long. Before you know it, we would have a new 'business model' and would be entering a 'new paradigm.'\" (Pg. 74) He observes, \"Greenspan had been right---risk had truly been unbundled. We had just packaged it right back up and shoved it down the eager throats of the wealthy taxpayers of Orange County. Warren Buffett was also right---when the tide did finally go out, as it did rapidly in 1994, we learnt that Orange County was swimming naked.\" (Pg. 50) Later, he notes, \"Some dealers warned Orange County about the risks they were running. At the time, Robert Citron regarded himself as a genius, encouraged in this belief by the dealers who were cashing in on his brilliance... Dealers love sophisticated investors. They are easy pickings.\" (Pg. 127) He concludes, \"Who was paying for the party? It turned out to be Orange County taxpayers.\" (Pg. 214) He comments, \"Traders become locked into a life that is focuses exclusively on work and making money. They dress well and live well. Their reading consists of work materials, an occasional business book... and the odd pulp fiction or spy novel at airports... They exist in an isolated world of premium class business travel, limo transfers and five-star hotels. Butlers, valets, maids, cooks, lifestyle assistants and personal trainers surround them. This becomes the reality of existence. Others perform the simple acts of living for them. They cease to be capable of doing anything for themselves.\" (Pg. 78) He observes, \"There is a lot of activity around bonus time, very little of which has anything to do with trading... the day after the cheque clears there is frequently a glut of personnel announcements... Bonuses also drive spending. Luxury car dealers' fortunes are closely tied to the level of bonuses in banking...\" (Pg. 147) He recounts that \"a mathematician, had taught at the university and, tired of seeing his students earn far more than he did, joined the migration to banking. From time to time he visited his former academic colleagues to discuss the latest research. They were derisive about his job: they were involved in interesting work. The maths he used to model derivatives was trivial, undergraduate stuff. He consoled himself with the fact that he took home, in a good year, ten times what they made. He was a POW---a prisoner of Wall Street. It was about the money.\" (Pg. 183-184) The book can be somewhat disconcerting, in how it flits from one topic to another, interspersed with Das's personal recollections. Nevertheless, this is a fascinating (and somewhat prescient!) view of the derivatives and financial services industry, originally written just before the financial collapse of 2007-2009. It will be very welcome reading for anyone studying this era."

Like the others who failed, he was not Lewis-like enough to carry the narrative. On the plus side, I give Das credit for his clear explanations of the many derivative products that are out there today. Let’s award points, too, for his title, even though the book couldn’t quite live up to the humor it was meant to project. As for the shortcomings, the worst, I thought, was the short shrift he gave to the more human elements. Lewis can get you involved with the people – smart or naïve, honest or corrupt, successful or beaten to a pulp. You want to know what happens to them in the unfolding story. Your understanding is helped by the fact that whole messy business has been personalized. With Das, it’s more just a laundry list of the financial products and recycled press accounts of famous meltdowns. Whenever he does involve people, they’re either fictitious stick figures or categories of investment subspecies lumped together a little too conveniently into bins of disrepute. I’m sure he has a point when he says many of today’s financial instruments can postpone tax bills, shift risks to less savvy clients, and obfuscate product deliverables, but in my mind he overplayed his cynicism and lost credibility in the process. Not all M&A activity is cannibalism, not all derivatives were created to dupe someone, and not all people in the industry are crooked. He weakens his case when he implies as much."

        "text":"Das, a derivatives and risk expert, takes a very snarky look at these complex products that exploded the financial world in 2008 (though he is writing in 2006). Few people understand them, but whenever investors are flush with cash, money has to end up somewhere, and it's often seeking the highest return. The quants who create them may understand the equations, but not the real world consequences. The salespeople who sell them don't really understand them, and the buyers - in a system ruled by asymmetric information, where the seller always knows more than the buyer - rarely ever do. Although not as dull or abstruse as a textbook, which Das also writes, this book does go into the weeds, and readers who have no knowledge whatsoever of derivatives will find themselves floating on a sea of mysterious acronyms, coupled with diagrams and flow charts. Das keeps it punchy with chapterette headings such as \"Rough Trade,\" \"Bondage,\" \"Dukes of Hazard,\" and \"Tranche Warfare.\" He tells us that heading into a trial preparation as a plaintiff's expert witness, where an Indonesian noodle company that had been snookered on some derivatives was suing the issuer, he had looked up Portia's \"quality of mercy\" speech from The Merchant of Venice as a precaution. The book is plagued by typos: missing apostrophes and quotation marks, and astonishingly, a consistent misspelling of Warren Buffett's name. Former Salomon head John Gutfreund is repeatedly referred to as \"John Gutenfreund.\""

        "text":"And you thought a book on derivatives and option trading would be boring. WRONG! How can wiping out the global economy ever be boring? Oh sure, Option Trading is a wonky subject, and I’ve read many a dry book on the subject, but this one breaks the mold. It really does help you understand the mechanics of the derivative world as well as show you real world applications in a hilarious manner. Well, hilarious if you weren’t the one losing all your money in the deal. Or if somehow you weren’t part of the global economy within the last decade. Let me step back at this point. Options. Basically, they’re for farmers. You plant a crop, spend all year tending to it, and need to be certain of a profit. Rather than relying on the weather and gods, you enter a contract. You limit your maximum profit, but put a floor on the downside. The baker does the same… he needs to ensure the price of flour stays low enough to keep his business going down the line. He enters into a buy contract for the farmer’s goods. Simple enough. And sure, why not scale that concept into new industries as well? Think fuel costs for a transportation company… now you’re getting the idea. But here’s the thing. Why shouldn’t Wall Street take advantage of such a simple thing? I mean, little risk and profits from the sale of the contracts. How could these masters of the universe fuck that up? Just like everything else they touch, it’s gotta turn to gold for them. And that’s why this book shines. When you seriously get to the causes behind all the messes caused by these guys, you’ll laugh so hard that you’ll cry. Mostly because a little part of you died on the inside and you were already crying to begin with. But you’ll laugh too! Now, I work on the ass end of this machine, but I’m still an insider. The book made me look around my office and laugh. Then cry. You see, the formula is the same no matter where you go in this industry. A bunch of young know nothings running around selling crap that even their PhD financial quant engineers can’t understand. It’s perfect, the kids, most all who are in their 20s, peddle weapons of mass destruction to anyone dumb enough to buy their bomb. I see it every day at work. Kids ruining client’s people’s retirements because they’re just too stupid to…. Nah, wait, not stupid. They just don’t care. Either way, the stupid\/not caring allows them rack in major paychecks. Wealth is not created by the financial industry, it is simply moved about. Now you’re thinking, “Hey, great idea… let’s get smart people in there instead?” Wrong again, my friend. See, knowing ‘stuff’ in this industry is a bad thing. If you know stuff, you make the salesman feel bad about what they’re doing. This goes up the chain of command too. The author points out how management is based on hitting sales goals instead of skill or experience, because obviously this is a way to run the global economy. But it is. Sure, not everyone is horrid asshole when it comes to this industry, but we’ll never get far enough in this corporate climate to change things. Given the fact that this book was written pre Great Recession, one could almost say it serves as a witty warning of things to come. Too bad that I’m writing this follow up in 2014… because I can tell you first hand that nothing has changed. And it’s not the industries fault. It’s yours. Yep, you know that boring guy you ignored when you tried to talk finance…? Remember how you brought all your money over to the 20 year old who kept blowing smoke up your ass instead?"

The reader will be challenged which is good and bad. I have to admit this was one of the hardest books I've ever read as the material is pretty thick. The depth of the subject covered in this book not for a casual audience. I probably now know more than I'll ever want to about derivatives, and more than I probably should about the internal dealings of Wall Street. I agree with the Financial Times assessment from the cover that this is fascinating reading, but only for those who are deeply, deeply interested in the topic. I was pulled in by the title's inclusion of the word \"guns\" as I was hoping for a book similar to \"Confessions of an Economic Hit Man\" by John Perkins. I was looking for more adventure and explosions or something with at least hit of espionage, in fact I don't think a gun ever made an appearance, so I felt suckered by the title. This book really was closer to a text book study of derivatives or at least one man's life story of working in derivative markets on Wall Street, than anything having to do with guns. Though perhaps I just didn't go all in on the metaphor the author was trying to push on the reader. I prefer the analogy that derivatives are closer to WMD's, not guns. The book is a bit more interesting reading in 2015, as it was published in 2006 before the big crash. The author makes many points that you cringe reading in hindsight about just how out of hand things had gotten during the era of his authorship. Many \"shame on us\" moments, but when has that ever stopped us (the American public) before, and doubtful it will stop us in the future. If you are the right audience for this, dive right in, other wise pass on by as it's going to be a long journey."

For example, I had not previously realized how mark to market accounting can be used to inflate profits and traders' bonuses and can lead to margin calls on illiquid top level CDO tranches when the failure of lower tranches causes a ratings downgrade in upper level tranches that would probably actually pay full value if held to maturity, so even if the models were right in predicting tiny risks of default, the accounting rules helped to accelerate the financial crisis. The book does a good job in showing how derivatives can create an economic house of cards rather than having positive value in increasing liquidity and stability. But in trying to be light and humorous, the author frequently becomes too cynical and snarky. And he could have gone a bit deeper than he did in explaining the math and the modeling. Surely it can't all be as much of a shell game as the author suggests, or if it is, I wish that he would have given me a little more substance to reach that conclusion on my own."

I still stand by what I said about the book's tone -- from the punchy three-word title you could recognise it for the way it reads, sort of a stand up comic routine on the derivative markets. The first half wasn't especially compelling, as the castigation of financial professionals is so generalised. You have to be offensive to be funny, I guess. Once you get past that, the second half rocks -- perhaps because I don't take any personal offense, not being involved in derivatives. It's a great insider's view of how and why derivatives evolved, with great and simple (and cynical) explanations of why various structures were created (generally, to evade taxes, get around trading regulations, and other ways to give investors more yield and earn banks more fees). The anecdotes and narrative read like a late-night drink confessional -- probably exaggerated but sounding true enough in essence, and deeply educational. As mentioned previously, it doesn't claim to be a rigorous, comprehensive risk management textbook (which Das has written) so it won't be that sort of educational if that's what you're looking for. But through anecdotes it gives a sharp sense of the culture of the people involved, something you could never find even in very good textbooks."

You probably need a basic understanding of finance and derivatives to enjoy this book because it can get a little technical. I certainly learned a lot more about derivatives after reading this. Some chapters get a little repetitive but overall the book is really interesting. The examples of companies using derivatives to inflate their balances sheets or to comply with EU regulations before a merger just go to show how much craftiness and deception can come from the finance industry.

        "text":"The Skinny: Fun, fast read about the wild world of derivatives. Essentially a series of mini stories through which different derivatives are explained. The Good: First off, the fact that this was written right before the global financial crisis makes it extra interesting. As you read the stories all I could think about is how the derivatives for the GFC were being created. I think The Big Short may have gotten some inspiration from this book. Overall the book is a good read. The stories are humorous, the material is digestible, and it sheds a lot of light on a sector that is often super confusing. Laughed out loud more than I expected for sure. The Bad: You will need some passing familiarity with derivatives to appreciate it properly but most concepts are explained well enough to follow, although you will still get confused here and there. Some parts are certainly more interesting than others. Too many gosh darn grammar and typos."

        "text":"A REVEALING PRE-2008 FINANCIAL CRISIS PORTRAIT OF DERIVATIVES, AND THE INDUSTRY THAT SELLS THEM Sanyajit Das is a financial analyst who had written many books on derivatives and related topics, such as 'Extreme Money: Masters of the Universe and the Cult of Risk,' 'Risk Management and Financial Derivatives,' 'Credit Derivatives, Swap and Derivative Financing,' etc. He has also revised this 2006 book... He wrote in the Preface, \"[This book] is the record of my time in the derivatives industry. It is a collection of tales about the products, the people and the strange goings-on in the business... There is almost no literature that explains the industry in an accessible way. There is also little that sets out the practices, some of which are insane, of this mysterious area of finance. [The book] explains the industry, how it operates and what it does. The book does not attempt to make a case for and against derivatives, it just shows what REALLY goes on every day in the dealing rooms in major financial centers, the real life dramas and rational madness that shape modern markets. [The book] is intended for two audiences. People in banking and finance ... will find it a wry and entertaining read... This book is also for those who want an accessible introduction to this weird and wonderful world. It will perhaps confirm their worst fears and prejudices about these strange instruments, what they are used for and the people who trade them.\" (Pg. xiii) He recalls, \"Many of today's traders hadn't been born when I stumbled accidently into derivatives trading. I had spent over 25 years in this world of traders, guns and money. The traders and money were clear enough. And you couldn't have financial weapons more powerful than derivatives---they were the big guns of the trade... How did I get there? I had followed the money... I had not known very much about derivatives when I started. How did I get here? ... This is that story. It is also coincidentally the story of the rise and rules of derivative trading---its 'knowns' and its 'unknowns.'\" (Pg. 18) He points out, \"The major defender of derivatives was Alan Greenspan, Chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York... The head of the central bank's role as cheerleader for the derivatives lobby was curious.\" (Pg. 20) He recalls, \"We needed 'innovation,' we were told. We created increasingly odd products. These obscure structures allowed us to earn higher margins than the cutthroat vanilla business... New structures that clients actually wanted were not that easy to create... The truth was that we weren't very creative but by golly, we were good at plagiarism. We chased our tails some more.\" (Pg. 41) Later, he adds, \"Survival requires keeping your head down. There was no point in resisting the latest fad. I just nodded and kept doing what I always did---trying to make money. No management fad lasted long. Before you know it, we would have a new 'business model' and would be entering a 'new paradigm.'\" (Pg. 74) He observes, \"Greenspan had been right---risk had truly been unbundled. We had just packaged it right back up and shoved it down the eager throats of the wealthy taxpayers of Orange County. Warren Buffett was also right---when the tide did finally go out, as it did rapidly in 1994, we learnt that Orange County was swimming naked.\" (Pg. 50) Later, he notes, \"Some dealers warned Orange County about the risks they were running. At the time, Robert Citron regarded himself as a genius, encouraged in this belief by the dealers who were cashing in on his brilliance... Dealers love sophisticated investors. They are easy pickings.\" (Pg. 127) He concludes, \"Who was paying for the party? It turned out to be Orange County taxpayers.\" (Pg. 214) He comments, \"Traders become locked into a life that is focuses exclusively on work and making money. They dress well and live well. Their reading consists of work materials, an occasional business book... and the odd pulp fiction or spy novel at airports... They exist in an isolated world of premium class business travel, limo transfers and five-star hotels. Butlers, valets, maids, cooks, lifestyle assistants and personal trainers surround them. This becomes the reality of existence. Others perform the simple acts of living for them. They cease to be capable of doing anything for themselves.\" (Pg. 78) He observes, \"There is a lot of activity around bonus time, very little of which has anything to do with trading... the day after the cheque clears there is frequently a glut of personnel announcements... Bonuses also drive spending. Luxury car dealers' fortunes are closely tied to the level of bonuses in banking...\" (Pg. 147) He recounts that \"a mathematician, had taught at the university and, tired of seeing his students earn far more than he did, joined the migration to banking. From time to time he visited his former academic colleagues to discuss the latest research. They were derisive about his job: they were involved in interesting work. The maths he used to model derivatives was trivial, undergraduate stuff. He consoled himself with the fact that he took home, in a good year, ten times what they made. He was a POW---a prisoner of Wall Street. It was about the money.\" (Pg. 183-184) The book can be somewhat disconcerting, in how it flits from one topic to another, interspersed with Das's personal recollections. Nevertheless, this is a fascinating (and somewhat prescient!) view of the derivatives and financial services industry, originally written just before the financial collapse of 2007-2009. It will be very welcome reading for anyone studying this era."

Like the others who failed, he was not Lewis-like enough to carry the narrative. On the plus side, I give Das credit for his clear explanations of the many derivative products that are out there today. Let’s award points, too, for his title, even though the book couldn’t quite live up to the humor it was meant to project. As for the shortcomings, the worst, I thought, was the short shrift he gave to the more human elements. Lewis can get you involved with the people – smart or naïve, honest or corrupt, successful or beaten to a pulp. You want to know what happens to them in the unfolding story. Your understanding is helped by the fact that whole messy business has been personalized. With Das, it’s more just a laundry list of the financial products and recycled press accounts of famous meltdowns. Whenever he does involve people, they’re either fictitious stick figures or categories of investment subspecies lumped together a little too conveniently into bins of disrepute. I’m sure he has a point when he says many of today’s financial instruments can postpone tax bills, shift risks to less savvy clients, and obfuscate product deliverables, but in my mind he overplayed his cynicism and lost credibility in the process. Not all M&A activity is cannibalism, not all derivatives were created to dupe someone, and not all people in the industry are crooked. He weakens his case when he implies as much."

        "text":"Das, a derivatives and risk expert, takes a very snarky look at these complex products that exploded the financial world in 2008 (though he is writing in 2006). Few people understand them, but whenever investors are flush with cash, money has to end up somewhere, and it's often seeking the highest return. The quants who create them may understand the equations, but not the real world consequences. The salespeople who sell them don't really understand them, and the buyers - in a system ruled by asymmetric information, where the seller always knows more than the buyer - rarely ever do. Although not as dull or abstruse as a textbook, which Das also writes, this book does go into the weeds, and readers who have no knowledge whatsoever of derivatives will find themselves floating on a sea of mysterious acronyms, coupled with diagrams and flow charts. Das keeps it punchy with chapterette headings such as \"Rough Trade,\" \"Bondage,\" \"Dukes of Hazard,\" and \"Tranche Warfare.\" He tells us that heading into a trial preparation as a plaintiff's expert witness, where an Indonesian noodle company that had been snookered on some derivatives was suing the issuer, he had looked up Portia's \"quality of mercy\" speech from The Merchant of Venice as a precaution. The book is plagued by typos: missing apostrophes and quotation marks, and astonishingly, a consistent misspelling of Warren Buffett's name. Former Salomon head John Gutfreund is repeatedly referred to as \"John Gutenfreund.\""

Oh sure, Option Trading is a wonky subject, and I’ve read many a dry book on the subject, but this one breaks the mold. It really does help you understand the mechanics of the derivative world as well as show you real world applications in a hilarious manner. Well, hilarious if you weren’t the one losing all your money in the deal. Or if somehow you weren’t part of the global economy within the last decade. Let me step back at this point. Options. Basically, they’re for farmers. You plant a crop, spend all year tending to it, and need to be certain of a profit. Rather than relying on the weather and gods, you enter a contract. You limit your maximum profit, but put a floor on the downside. The baker does the same… he needs to ensure the price of flour stays low enough to keep his business going down the line. He enters into a buy contract for the farmer’s goods. Simple enough. And sure, why not scale that concept into new industries as well? Think fuel costs for a transportation company… now you’re getting the idea. But here’s the thing. Why shouldn’t Wall Street take advantage of such a simple thing? I mean, little risk and profits from the sale of the contracts. How could these masters of the universe fuck that up? Just like everything else they touch, it’s gotta turn to gold for them. And that’s why this book shines. When you seriously get to the causes behind all the messes caused by these guys, you’ll laugh so hard that you’ll cry. Mostly because a little part of you died on the inside and you were already crying to begin with. But you’ll laugh too! Now, I work on the ass end of this machine, but I’m still an insider. The book made me look around my office and laugh. Then cry. You see, the formula is the same no matter where you go in this industry. A bunch of young know nothings running around selling crap that even their PhD financial quant engineers can’t understand. It’s perfect, the kids, most all who are in their 20s, peddle weapons of mass destruction to anyone dumb enough to buy their bomb. I see it every day at work. Kids ruining client’s people’s retirements because they’re just too stupid to…. Nah, wait, not stupid. They just don’t care. Either way, the stupid\/not caring allows them rack in major paychecks. Wealth is not created by the financial industry, it is simply moved about. Now you’re thinking, “Hey, great idea… let’s get smart people in there instead?” Wrong again, my friend. See, knowing ‘stuff’ in this industry is a bad thing. If you know stuff, you make the salesman feel bad about what they’re doing. This goes up the chain of command too. The author points out how management is based on hitting sales goals instead of skill or experience, because obviously this is a way to run the global economy. But it is. Sure, not everyone is horrid asshole when it comes to this industry, but we’ll never get far enough in this corporate climate to change things. Given the fact that this book was written pre Great Recession, one could almost say it serves as a witty warning of things to come. Too bad that I’m writing this follow up in 2014… because I can tell you first hand that nothing has changed. And it’s not the industries fault. It’s yours. Yep, you know that boring guy you ignored when you tried to talk finance…? Remember how you brought all your money over to the 20 year old who kept blowing smoke up your ass instead?"

The reader will be challenged which is good and bad. I have to admit this was one of the hardest books I've ever read as the material is pretty thick. The depth of the subject covered in this book not for a casual audience. I probably now know more than I'll ever want to about derivatives, and more than I probably should about the internal dealings of Wall Street. I agree with the Financial Times assessment from the cover that this is fascinating reading, but only for those who are deeply, deeply interested in the topic. I was pulled in by the title's inclusion of the word \"guns\" as I was hoping for a book similar to \"Confessions of an Economic Hit Man\" by John Perkins. I was looking for more adventure and explosions or something with at least hit of espionage, in fact I don't think a gun ever made an appearance, so I felt suckered by the title. This book really was closer to a text book study of derivatives or at least one man's life story of working in derivative markets on Wall Street, than anything having to do with guns. Though perhaps I just didn't go all in on the metaphor the author was trying to push on the reader. I prefer the analogy that derivatives are closer to WMD's, not guns. The book is a bit more interesting reading in 2015, as it was published in 2006 before the big crash. The author makes many points that you cringe reading in hindsight about just how out of hand things had gotten during the era of his authorship. Many \"shame on us\" moments, but when has that ever stopped us (the American public) before, and doubtful it will stop us in the future. If you are the right audience for this, dive right in, other wise pass on by as it's going to be a long journey."

For example, I had not previously realized how mark to market accounting can be used to inflate profits and traders' bonuses and can lead to margin calls on illiquid top level CDO tranches when the failure of lower tranches causes a ratings downgrade in upper level tranches that would probably actually pay full value if held to maturity, so even if the models were right in predicting tiny risks of default, the accounting rules helped to accelerate the financial crisis. The book does a good job in showing how derivatives can create an economic house of cards rather than having positive value in increasing liquidity and stability. But in trying to be light and humorous, the author frequently becomes too cynical and snarky. And he could have gone a bit deeper than he did in explaining the math and the modeling. Surely it can't all be as much of a shell game as the author suggests, or if it is, I wish that he would have given me a little more substance to reach that conclusion on my own."

I still stand by what I said about the book's tone -- from the punchy three-word title you could recognise it for the way it reads, sort of a stand up comic routine on the derivative markets. The first half wasn't especially compelling, as the castigation of financial professionals is so generalised. You have to be offensive to be funny, I guess. Once you get past that, the second half rocks -- perhaps because I don't take any personal offense, not being involved in derivatives. It's a great insider's view of how and why derivatives evolved, with great and simple (and cynical) explanations of why various structures were created (generally, to evade taxes, get around trading regulations, and other ways to give investors more yield and earn banks more fees). The anecdotes and narrative read like a late-night drink confessional -- probably exaggerated but sounding true enough in essence, and deeply educational. As mentioned previously, it doesn't claim to be a rigorous, comprehensive risk management textbook (which Das has written) so it won't be that sort of educational if that's what you're looking for. But through anecdotes it gives a sharp sense of the culture of the people involved, something you could never find even in very good textbooks."

You probably need a basic understanding of finance and derivatives to enjoy this book because it can get a little technical. I certainly learned a lot more about derivatives after reading this. Some chapters get a little repetitive but overall the book is really interesting. The examples of companies using derivatives to inflate their balances sheets or to comply with EU regulations before a merger just go to show how much craftiness and deception can come from the finance industry.

        "text":"The Skinny: Fun, fast read about the wild world of derivatives. Essentially a series of mini stories through which different derivatives are explained. The Good: First off, the fact that this was written right before the global financial crisis makes it extra interesting. As you read the stories all I could think about is how the derivatives for the GFC were being created. I think The Big Short may have gotten some inspiration from this book. Overall the book is a good read. The stories are humorous, the material is digestible, and it sheds a lot of light on a sector that is often super confusing. Laughed out loud more than I expected for sure. The Bad: You will need some passing familiarity with derivatives to appreciate it properly but most concepts are explained well enough to follow, although you will still get confused here and there. Some parts are certainly more interesting than others. Too many gosh darn grammar and typos."

        "text":"A REVEALING PRE-2008 FINANCIAL CRISIS PORTRAIT OF DERIVATIVES, AND THE INDUSTRY THAT SELLS THEM Sanyajit Das is a financial analyst who had written many books on derivatives and related topics, such as 'Extreme Money: Masters of the Universe and the Cult of Risk,' 'Risk Management and Financial Derivatives,' 'Credit Derivatives, Swap and Derivative Financing,' etc. He has also revised this 2006 book... He wrote in the Preface, \"[This book] is the record of my time in the derivatives industry. It is a collection of tales about the products, the people and the strange goings-on in the business... There is almost no literature that explains the industry in an accessible way. There is also little that sets out the practices, some of which are insane, of this mysterious area of finance. [The book] explains the industry, how it operates and what it does. The book does not attempt to make a case for and against derivatives, it just shows what REALLY goes on every day in the dealing rooms in major financial centers, the real life dramas and rational madness that shape modern markets. [The book] is intended for two audiences. People in banking and finance ... will find it a wry and entertaining read... This book is also for those who want an accessible introduction to this weird and wonderful world. It will perhaps confirm their worst fears and prejudices about these strange instruments, what they are used for and the people who trade them.\" (Pg. xiii) He recalls, \"Many of today's traders hadn't been born when I stumbled accidently into derivatives trading. I had spent over 25 years in this world of traders, guns and money. The traders and money were clear enough. And you couldn't have financial weapons more powerful than derivatives---they were the big guns of the trade... How did I get there? I had followed the money... I had not known very much about derivatives when I started. How did I get here? ... This is that story. It is also coincidentally the story of the rise and rules of derivative trading---its 'knowns' and its 'unknowns.'\" (Pg. 18) He points out, \"The major defender of derivatives was Alan Greenspan, Chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York... The head of the central bank's role as cheerleader for the derivatives lobby was curious.\" (Pg. 20) He recalls, \"We needed 'innovation,' we were told. We created increasingly odd products. These obscure structures allowed us to earn higher margins than the cutthroat vanilla business... New structures that clients actually wanted were not that easy to create... The truth was that we weren't very creative but by golly, we were good at plagiarism. We chased our tails some more.\" (Pg. 41) Later, he adds, \"Survival requires keeping your head down. There was no point in resisting the latest fad. I just nodded and kept doing what I always did---trying to make money. No management fad lasted long. Before you know it, we would have a new 'business model' and would be entering a 'new paradigm.'\" (Pg. 74) He observes, \"Greenspan had been right---risk had truly been unbundled. We had just packaged it right back up and shoved it down the eager throats of the wealthy taxpayers of Orange County. Warren Buffett was also right---when the tide did finally go out, as it did rapidly in 1994, we learnt that Orange County was swimming naked.\" (Pg. 50) Later, he notes, \"Some dealers warned Orange County about the risks they were running. At the time, Robert Citron regarded himself as a genius, encouraged in this belief by the dealers who were cashing in on his brilliance... Dealers love sophisticated investors. They are easy pickings.\" (Pg. 127) He concludes, \"Who was paying for the party? It turned out to be Orange County taxpayers.\" (Pg. 214) He comments, \"Traders become locked into a life that is focuses exclusively on work and making money. They dress well and live well. Their reading consists of work materials, an occasional business book... and the odd pulp fiction or spy novel at airports... They exist in an isolated world of premium class business travel, limo transfers and five-star hotels. Butlers, valets, maids, cooks, lifestyle assistants and personal trainers surround them. This becomes the reality of existence. Others perform the simple acts of living for them. They cease to be capable of doing anything for themselves.\" (Pg. 78) He observes, \"There is a lot of activity around bonus time, very little of which has anything to do with trading... the day after the cheque clears there is frequently a glut of personnel announcements... Bonuses also drive spending. Luxury car dealers' fortunes are closely tied to the level of bonuses in banking...\" (Pg. 147) He recounts that \"a mathematician, had taught at the university and, tired of seeing his students earn far more than he did, joined the migration to banking. From time to time he visited his former academic colleagues to discuss the latest research. They were derisive about his job: they were involved in interesting work. The maths he used to model derivatives was trivial, undergraduate stuff. He consoled himself with the fact that he took home, in a good year, ten times what they made. He was a POW---a prisoner of Wall Street. It was about the money.\" (Pg. 183-184) The book can be somewhat disconcerting, in how it flits from one topic to another, interspersed with Das's personal recollections. Nevertheless, this is a fascinating (and somewhat prescient!) view of the derivatives and financial services industry, originally written just before the financial collapse of 2007-2009. It will be very welcome reading for anyone studying this era."

The structure of the book never changed, but its breadth caused him to complete it in stages, under the overall title Annals of the Former World . Like the terrain it covers, Annals of the Former World tells a multilayered tale, and the reader may choose one of many paths through it.

My favorite parts are where McPhee weaves place and people, or people and ideas together and establishes the grand metaphor for his book. McPhee picks up pieces of conversation with geologists and their satelites that might get missed by most other writers, but manages to find, keep and eventually place these nuggets into his book (written over 20 years) in a way that works to support his big themes. Seriously, this book is one of my favorite nonfiction works of all time. You can see the mark McPhee left on his students' writing if you've ever read Robert Wright , Richard Preston or New Yorker editor David Remnick . Some consider McPhee to be the godfather of New New Journalism, but he is much more than that. IMHO, he is the godfather of modern nonfiction writing, period."

Layer by layer, McPhee sediments one's grasp of deep time, and of the geologists who study it. A little too accessible to be called \"magisterial\", but it still evokes that feeling.

In gloomy Victorian halls and on sunny limestone outcrops we tried to get siltstones and schists and garnets to sing to us, to reveal their secrets. Sadly, as in all the sciences, many geologists aren't very good storytellers. That's why we have John McPhee. Through his prose, mountains tell their stories. While the stories collected in Annals of the Former World, don't compare to his masterful The Control of Nature, their still pretty wonderful. Geology is the centerpiece, but it's also biography, human history, and aesthetics. Landscape is no longer two-dimensional, but four-dimensional and visionary."

        "text":"\"Geologists, in their all but closed conversation, inhabit scenes that no one ever saw, scenes of global sweep, gone and gone again, including seas, mountains, rivers, forests, and archipelagoes of aching beauty rising in volcanic violence to settle down quietly and then forever disappear—almost disappear.” “If by some fiat I had to restrict all this writing to one sentence, this is the one I would choose: The summit of Mt. Everest is marine limestone.” My first review will be in Annals and then I will review the rest in the individual books. I may be cheating by doing it this way, but in this reread I have a lot I want to talk about and there are restrictions on characters in these reviews and I am running up against them. I found that out with Annie Dillard’s Pilgrim at Tinker Creek, where I tried to not only immortalize her words, but talk about how they made me feel and think and ran out of room. So, I am rereading the whole canon, Annals of the Former World, but reviewing each book separately, which they are technically separate books, so technically not cheating by claiming each one separately. And I feel that I am writing the way Mr. McPhee writes, in grand sentences, and with grand ideas, and with caveats and humor, and must apologize for the copycatting. I also think that talking, reading, and thinking about geology does this to me. Mr. McPhee is credited with opening a huge new interest in geology in us laypeople. I have to credit it more emphatically to Annie Dillard, who has 2 examples of “big picture” geology and deep time, one like a lyrical waking dream, and the other an artist’s interpretation of time: “Mountains burst up, jutting, and dull and soften before your eyes, clothed in forests like felt. The ice rolls up, grinding green land under water forever; the ice rolls back.\" I have never been the same, always attuned to the geopoetry of this way of looking at the world, and seeing the links between Dillard and McPhee in my worldview. An example of what it does goes like this: I read a sentence such as “There was glaciation in the Southern Hemisphere at the time.” And my mind is blown, why in the Ice Ages was there so little glaciation in the Southern Hemisphere? Antarctica is obviously a fertile field for glaciers, how have I never though of this? Why was there in this period he is talking about? McPhee drops information like this often, and sometimes answers the question I have, sometimes not, this being a throw away sentence, so I have to pause and start googling. What a world we live in, to have this information at our fingertips, literally. This is the type of thinking that makes kids into scientists, so I am first, thrilled I can have that innocence of wonder and awe, and secondly, that also makes poets, and that is why this is such a source of joy for me. ”The poles of the earth have wandered. The equator has apparently moved. The continents, perched on their plates, are thought to have been carried so very far and to be going in so many directions that it seems an act of almost pure hubris to assert that some landmark of our world is fixed at 73 degrees 57 minutes and 53 seconds west longitude and 40 degrees 51 minutes and 14 seconds north latitude—a temporary description, at any rate, as if for a boat on the sea.” This opening is so similar to Annie Dillard’s style that I was hooked from the minute I picked up the 734 page book. I don’t think he is copying her, he just has that sense of what hooks a reader and how to plant a thought that all of us wanderers and armchair wanderers muse about from time to time; where is this place we have been set down? There is a new interactive map ( https:\/\/dinosaurpictures.org\/ancient-... ) that will demonstrate where whatever place you are interested in has been in the past 20 million, 75 million, 400 million, etc. years you are interested in, and it is like McPhee got that in his head from his travels over 20 years with geologists. ” You are in central Nevada, about four hundred miles east of San Francisco, and after you have climbed these mountains you look out upon (as it appears in present theory) open sea. You drop swiftly to the coast, and then move on across moderately profound water full of pelagic squid, water that is quietly accumulating the sediments which—ages in the future—will become the roof rock of the rising Sierra. Tall volcanoes are standing in the sea. Then, at roughly the point where the Sierran foothills will end and the Great Valley will begin—at Auburn, California—you move beyond the shelf and over deep ocean. There are probably some islands out there somewhere, but fundamentally you are crossing above ocean crustal floor that reaches to the China Sea. Below you there is no hint of North America, no hint of the valley or the hills where Sacramento and San Francisco will be.” These passages are one of the main hooks for me, as I travelled across the country several times, only a few by I80 but it is not necessary for the idea, the inspiration. McPhee places the geology in my sense of place and on the land instead of a theoretical or obscure science. I love long distance driving, I love being so close to the land and looking up at the sky; I feel as close to flying on the ground as you can be, and McPhee’s descriptions do nearly the same thing. Land and mountains seem so sure, so permanent, but we know they are not. They become sand. And after that, they sink and are piled upon by sediment to become rock again, and then sand again. So the basic building block of our planet is a grain of sand. Annie Dillard does an thought experiment of looking at a bird, and trying to visualize it becoming defeathered and de-evolved into a lizard and then back again; my favorite is while in a talus filed, or a sand dune field under mountains, to visualize them building up into mountains and then dissolving again in time; and that is why geology is the “music of the earth,” per Hans Cloos. Or as the author describes why he chose I80, it “avoids melodrama, avoids the Grand Canyons, the Jackson Holes, the geologic operas of the country, but it would surely be a sound experience of the big picture, of the history, the construction, the components of the continent. And in all likelihood it would display in its roadcuts rock from every epoch and era.” ”Slowly disassemble the Rocky Mountains and carry the material in small fragments to the Mississippi Delta. The delta builds down. It presses ever deeper on the mantle. Its depth at the moment exceeds twenty-five thousand feet. The heat and the pressure are so great down there that the silt is turning into siltstone, the sand into sandstone, the mud into shale. The Gulf of Mexico was a good example of a geosyncline, with a large part of the Rocky Mountains sitting in it as more than twenty-five thousand feet of silt, sand, and mud, siltstone, sandstone, and shale.” I hiked in the Mount Evans Wilderness recently, along a creek that was carving out the basement rock of the fourteener, and came across a rock outcrop that had an alcove below and a hanging garden above, and it was a wall of the trail, essentially and again, was drawn into a meditation of the mountain crumbling into these giant rocks who live with us for a while and then crumble into smaller stones, and then sand. It is a way of seeing I love. At the same time, beneath my feet, the sand and dirt I walk upon is putting pressure on the detritus of the mountains below us, and rock is being born. McPhee is a translator of sorts, as he says and then alchemizes it: “Geologists, in their all but closed conversation, inhabit scenes that no one ever saw, scenes of global sweep, gone and gone again, including seas, mountains, rivers, forests, and archipelagoes of aching beauty rising in volcanic violence to settle down quietly and then forever disappear—almost disappear.” This book is one of my favorite of the series, and contains the narrative description of what McPhee coined as “deep time.” He writes about the history of geology in an alive, engaging way I wish all historians could try; and as he describes James Hutton, the Scottish father of modern geology, Hutton “had no way of knowing that there were seventy million years just in the line that separated the two kinds of rock, and many millions more in the story of each formation—but he sensed something like it, sensed the awesome truth, and as he stood there staring at the riverbank he was seeing it for all humankind.” If you don’t get chills from that visual, I am sorry. To see something, to sense it, based on your eyes and mind, for all of humankind is a holy moment. “It was at some moment in the Pleistocene that humanity crossed what the geologist-theologian Pierre Teilhard de Chardin called the Threshold of Reflection, when something in people “turned back on itself and so to speak took an infinite leap forward. Outwardly, almost nothing in the organs had changed. But in depth, a great revolution had taken place: consciousness was now leaping and boiling in a space of super-sensory relationships and representations; and simultaneously consciousness was capable of perceiving itself in the concentrated simplicity of its faculties. And all this happened for the first time.” Annie Dillard wrote in 1974 and then in 1990 in more depth, about Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, so I was delighted he is in Basin and Range. Teilhard was a paleontologist, priest and philosopher and my main mantra in life is attributed to him: : \"Throughout my whole life, during every minute of it, the world has been gradually lighting up and blazing before my eyes until it has come to surround me, entirely lit up from within.\" When I read about the Threshold of Reflection, I wished I was there. In my mind, it links to the immortalized footsteps found in Tanzania where Mary Leakey found a trail of hominid footprints, as Dillard writes in For the Time Being: “They walked on moist volcanic tuff and ash. We have a record of those few seconds from a day about 3.6 million years ago—More ash covered the footprints and hardened like plaster. Ash also preserved the pockmarks of the raindrops that fell beside the three who walked: it was a rainy day. We do not know why the woman paused and turned left, briefly, before continuing. “A remote ancestor,” Leakey said, “experienced a moment of doubt.” Possibly they watched the Sadiman volcano erupting, or they took a last look back before they left. We do know we cannot make anything so lasting as these three barefoot ones did.” Perhaps they became conscious of themselves as conscious beings in that moment, meaning, perhaps, we were all there. McPhee writes, “The mind seemed to grow giddy by looking so far into the abyss of time.” Why yes, yes it did, and it still does, maybe always. Some deep time analogies: ”Geologists will sometimes use the calendar year as a unit to represent the time scale, and in such terms the Precambrian runs from New Year’s Day until well after Halloween. Dinosaurs appear in the middle of December and are gone the day after Christmas. The last ice sheet melts on December 31st at one minute before midnight, and the Roman Empire lasts five seconds.” “With your arms spread wide again to represent all time on earth, look at one hand with its line of life. The Cambrian begins in the wrist, and the Permian Extinction is at the outer end of the palm. All of the Cenozoic is in a fingerprint, and in a single stroke with a medium-grained nail file you could eradicate human history.” “The human consciousness may have begun to leap and boil some sunny day in the Pleistocene, but the race by and large has retained the essence of its animal sense of time. People think in five generations—two ahead, two behind—with heavy concentration on the one in the middle. Possibly that is tragic, and possibly there is no choice. The human mind may not have evolved enough to be able to comprehend deep time. It may only be able to measure it.” Going into the deep time meditation a little differently, about the spans of time in either direction, I loved these imageries: “There is no younger rock in the United States than the travertine that is forming in Thermopolis, Wyoming. A 2.7-billion-year-old outcrop of the core of the continent is at the head of Wind River Canyon, twenty miles away.” “And in the deep shadow below the Cambrian were seven years for everyone in all subsequent time. There were four billion years back there—since the earliest beginnings of the world.” “In six thousand years, you could never grow wings on a reptile. With sixty million, however, you could have feathers, too.” “On the geologic time scale, a human lifetime is reduced to a brevity that is too inhibiting to think about. The mind blocks the information. Geologists, dealing always with deep time, find that it seeps into their beings and affects them in various ways: “Mammalian species last, typically, two million years. We’ve about used up ours. Every time Leakey finds something older, I say, ‘Oh! We’re overdue.’ We will be handing the dominant-species-on-earth position to some other group. We’ll have to be clever not to.” “If you free yourself from the conventional reaction to a quantity like a million years, you free yourself a bit from the boundaries of human time. And then in a way you do not live at all, but in another way you live forever.”"

        "text":"This book has a rhythm unlike anything else I've read, just like geology has a timescale that takes some time to wrap your head around. It's like an opera. Geology and opera both have a reputation of being long and boring, but they are also majestic and complex. This book is long, but it's not boring! For a while, when I first started this book, my three-year-old wanted me to read every other page to her--the words were like poetry. You can't read it quickly. Reading out loud helped me settle down to the book's pace. There are lots of big words: some of the geology geek persuasion, others of the English major nerd variety...but I wasn't constantly reaching for a dictionary. McPhee throws a new geology term at you, repeats it in multiple contexts so that you get a sense of the thing, and then offers a more complete definition, just in case you still need help. It's engaging. At first I was a little bothered by the lack of photographs of everything. McPhee uses a thousand words to make a picture, but I still wouldn't recognize welded tuff if it was right in front of me. I wanted a modernized, six minute YouTube clip series complete with reality TV interviews with the geologists right at the road cut...I'm not sure I would have savored that as much though. And also, the ideas still get through. I don't want to be a geologist, and I don't need to memorize what all the rocks look like. But I have a much better picture of the complexities of the idea of plate tectonics, what it explains, what it doesn't. And while I'm sure some of the ideas presented in the book are dated, the big picture of geology hasn't changed too much from the public's perspective in the last twenty some-odd years. Each book described some section of geology along Interstate 80, as well as the background of the geologist that McPhee accompanies during that stretch of land. (You really don't have to read the books in order, if you don't want to.) Rising from the Plains was my favorite. The geologist, David Love, had a childhood much like Ralph Moody (who wrote the Little Britches series), and Love's story is woven into the geology of Wyoming beautifully. What an adventure!"

        "text":"This entire book is an artifact from another era, an era when scientific writing for the general reader was undergoing some necessary upgrades. Unfortunately, that is exactly how it reads—as a stylistically interstitial relic. In recent years, science writing has largely eschewed jargon, verbiage, and writerly flourishes—focusing instead on comprehension and simplicity. This book is not simple. It does not eschew verbiage, flourishes, or scientific nomenclature. Furthermore, it is cavalierly uninterested in aiding reader comprehension. After reading 660 pages on the geology of North America, my ignorance of the subject is undiminished. I studied a little geology in college (in Wyoming, no less). I have traveled extensively throughout North America, and the terrain covered in the book (I-80 and environs, principally) is quite familiar to me. Yet I often could not picture in my mind’s eye what McPhee was describing. For whatever reason, this book was published with almost no visual aids. That is inexcusable for a deeply complex book about geology, let alone one ostensibly written for the general reader. Wikipedia entries on lithospheric phenomena are pure pleasure reading by comparison. There were, to be sure, portions of text that were smooth, enlightening, and easy to follow. Such section were rare. Midway through the book, I switched from a paperback to a Kindle version because the ability to look up obscure terms became essential. Why? Because McPhee does nothing whatsoever to ensure the reader understands what he’s talking about. He just throws scientific terms at you as if they are in everyday use and moves on. He says that something “inclines” but doesn’t tell you what he’s referring to, where it is, or what the “incline” is inclined toward. This book (which is really five books in one) has many fans and it has won many prizes. Well done. I found it exhausting."

In an attempt to remedy that, I did some brief research and came up with this book. I got the book for the Geology, I stayed for the writing. This book could be measured in pounds. The premise: seven hundred pages of nonfiction geology in United States. It sounded only slightly drier than dust, and I approached it warily. I was delightfully wrong. John McPhee's craft reminds me most of Steinbeck. (Side note, this may be the nudge up get me to finally read Steinbeck's nonfiction that's been on my shelf for years.) His book is a tapestry of character sketches and history, storytelling and journalism. I wanted to meet old geologists, and drive in a pickup truck across I-80 and drink coffee and look at rocks. Although it's technically scientific journalism, this book moved me like a story. Actually, it had more flavors and savors than much of the fiction I read. As the quote on the back cover by A O Scott says \"a deep philology of the continent... surely a classic.\" I agree. I'm delighted that this book won a pulitzer prize, and I will this again."

Its a compilation of all of McPhee's writings about American continental Geology. I know, sounds dull, but he uses the lives and characters of the Geologists whose work he is describing along with the massive narrative arc of plate tectonics and the history of the science itself. The story of America's westward expansion along with the Romantic era of northeastern America all seem to blend into a text that can miraculously also explain geomorphology and other remarkably dry topics. Gives the vast expanses of time a tiny human scale which we can then wonder at how our ancestors saw these places as well as the painstaking detective work that was critical to our understanding of how they formed, where these places came from and how in something as seemingly stolid as the ground beneath our feet is a plastic and still changing skin manipulated by forces beyond human comprehension. Utterly beautiful work–I know of nothing else like it."

        "text":"One of the geologist-contacts of John McPhee explains the impact his professional life has on his perspective: \"You care less about civilization. Half of me gets upset with civilization. The other half does not get upset. I shrug and think, So let the cockroaches take over.\" This, in a nutshell, is the escapism offered by this particular Pulitzer-winning magnum opus. Yeah, that CO2 buildup and our plastic debris will leave a permanent mark, but four billion years of rocks don't care about your pandemic anxiety. The volume is a collection of five books written by McPhee between 1978 and 1999 aimed at describing not only the rock exposed in roadcuts across the United States but also the geologists with whom he traveled. Because I borrowed the e-book from the library, I confess I had no idea I was delving into such a massive volume until I was probably 30 pages in. But at that point, I was hooked. Not that I always knew what McPhee was talking about. There was fatigued rock and incompetent rock and inequigranular fabric in rock. If you bent or folded rock, the inside of the curve was in a state of compression, the outside of the curve was under great tension, and somewhere in the middle was the surface of no strain -- the two sides were active in every fault. The inclination of a slope on which boulders would stay put was the angle of repose. Jargon can be poetic. There were festooned crossbeds and limestone sinks, pillow lavas and petrified trees, incised meanders and defeated streams. There were dike swarms and slickensides, explosion pits, volcanic bombs. Pulsating glaciers. Hogbacks. Radiolarian ooze. And while I probably read the word batholith fifty times without ever bothering to look it up, through all the texture McPhee imparts wonderfully not only five books' worth of geological knowledge, he builds throughout the volume, offering deeper perspectives in the later books. The setup is far from linear. You don't start in the east and end up in California. You jump around. But you do benefit from the fact that in the 20-year period McPhee wrote these books, his understanding of the evolution of the field as the plate tectonics revolution unfolded also grew. Plate tectonics became universally accepted in the '60s, only a few years before the first volume was written. By the '90s, a flourishing of understanding based on technology including isotopes and gravity fields and magnetic fields had brought to light so much more than when he started. One aspect of the writing that makes it come alive is the fact that it's about geologists as much as it's about geology. McPhee describes the geology only in the context of the dedicated men and women who live for the study. \"We are blind men feeling the elephant,\" David Love, of the Geological Survey, has said to me at least fifty times, he writes, referencing the Hindu fable of the blind men touching only one small piece of the creature while trying to infer the whole of it. The foremost problem with the Picture is that ninety-nine per cent of it is missing -- melted or dissolved, torn down, washed away, broken to bits, to become something else in the Picture. The geologist discovers lingering remains, and connects them with dotted lines. Geologists \"try to put the petals back on the flower.\" The ideal scenario for reading this book would be during a cross-country trip across I-80. But absent that real field experience, I found myself pulling up countless YouTube videos to accompany my reading, which enabled me to better visualize a lot of what McPhee describes. Plate tectonics is the star of the show, the framework around which everything else occurs. But the whole of the story is much more complex. Specific geologies are complex and messy. The Appalachians, for example, weren't simply formed the way the Himalayas are today, by two plates violently colliding. They were more the result of a schedule of arrivals of incoming exotic terranes – multiple collisions – over a long spread of time. \"Hotspots\" determine new island arcs and may even help cause continents to split. A thin crust and upraised mantle facilitate basin-and-range formation in Nevada today. Ice sheets set up and started Niagara Falls, moved the Ohio River, dug the Great Lakes. There was continental rifting below Nebraska and Iowa 1.1 billion years ago that stopped before it could turn to ocean. Pokagon State Park, Indiana is made of Canadian rocks, red jasper conglomerates from the north shore of Lake Huron, banded gray gneisses from central Ontario. Boston is African rock and the north of Ireland is American. Some other morsels: In any rock column, more time is missing than present, because erosion is a bigger driving force than orogeny (the building of mountains). And rock columns are more likely to commemorate a moment – a flood, an eruption – than to report a millennium. Like a news broadcast, it is more often a montage of disasters than a cumulative record of time. I visited the Grand Canyon at the age of thirteen. The park is uniquely suited to hitting visitors over the head with what McPhee calls its \"layer-cake\" geology, a gorgeous and linear time scale. But geology is rarely so accommodating. Rock isn't just laid down. It is turned on its side or upside-down. It metamorphosizes and gets moved thousands of miles. It melds with other rocks. The complexity is staggering. The whole Appalachian system continually fed upon itself. There are Precambrian pebbles, in Silurian rock. You'll see Silurian pebbles in Devonian rock, Devonian pebbles in Mississippian rock. Geology repeats itself. Even the wind can play an outsized role in favor of erosion. McPhee describes how a substantial amount of erosion from the Rocky mountains might end up as dust blown by storms into the North Atlantic Ocean. Oil deposits are correlated with conodont fossils of a particular hue. The presence of conodonts in the rock is an indicator of their being the right age, and the color of the fossils is in indication of the level of compression the rocks have undergone, a determinant of oil formation from carbon deposits. California is in large part a collection and compactation of oceanic islands. The \"Smartville arc\" brought gold to California. Toward the end of the middle Jurassic – in the high noon of the dinosaurs, about a hundred and sixty-five million years ago – an island arc like the Aleutians or Japan had moved in from the western ocean and docked here. This was the third terrane at this latitude: the one that followed Sonomia and smashed into it with crumpling, mountain-building effects that propogated eastward turning soils into phyllites, sandstones into quartzites, siltstones into slates – the metamorphics we had seen up the road. In aggregate, the three terranes extended the continent by at least four hundred miles. The third one, suturing here, had doubled the width of what is now California. … If the story of California sounds fantastic, with all its accreting arcs and melanges coming up from the western sea, just look at a map of the southwest Pacific – look at the relationship between Australia and Indonesia right now. [Hot spots] Great Meteor and Cape Verde seem to have lifted New England's high mountains, Bermuda the Smokies. Uplift accelerates erosion. The rock of the Permian period – the last chapter in the Appalachian mountain building story – has been removed everywhere in eastern America except in West Virginia and nearby parts of Ohio and Pennsylvania, halfway between the hot-spot tracks, halfway between New Hampshire and North Carolina. An ophiolite is a section of the Earth's oceanic crust and the underlying upper mantle that has been uplifted and exposed above sea level and often emplaced onto continental crustal rocks. The presence of ophiolites – which we see in California, among other places – is a consequence of continental collisions with oceanic plates. One geologist likened the ophiolite to a cow on a cowcatcher in front of an old western train. The earth as a whole is producing progressively less heat from radioactive decay, and that, at some point, is going to have a profound effect. In the future, the profound effect is going to be that the plates will stop moving. The plate tectonics revolution isn't the only recent revolution in geology. The ability to identify the age of rocks is significantly more advanced than it was in the day when the presence of fossils were the main yardstick. Iron minerals line up like compasses, pointing toward the changing magnetic poles. Isotope decay rates are known and constant. Rock types can be identified by their magnetic signatures. The magnetic field is sampling the shallow crust, the upper few thousand feet. The gravity field is averaging, basically, the whole lithosphere. When you look at a gravity map you are seeing deeper features of the crust. One problem with writing about science is that as any book is written, it immediately is threatened with obsolescence. McPhee observed, The thought occurs to me, not for the first time, that I am following a science as it lurches forward from error to discovery and back to error. But this is actually as much an asset of the writing as it is a detraction. I expect this volume will be worth reading even a hundred years from now because it is not just a textbook. It's written in the form of journeys, set pieces, flashbacks, biographical sketches, and histories of the human and lithic kind . And at the same time, it offers discovery and insight."

For the average joe to pick this up and read through it would be a battle - especially if the subject doesn't interest him. But as Dennis Hopper said to Chris Walken in True Romance \"this shit fascinates me.\" Different subject matter - same principle. I've always liked rocks and the thought of what went on before we got here - why things are the way they are - and what is going to continue long after we are gone has a certain appeal. There's a certain comfort that comes in reading about something that doesn't give a shit about the Dow Jones, ISIS, Obama, American Idol and the Superbowl. It's a planet doing it's thing and there's nothing you can do to stop it. It's not a predictive science. The geologic history in this book is interwoven with man's history in this country as it relates to the areas across a specific latitude of the US. Though there is a lot of rocks to wade through I really enjoyed the book. I probably didn't absorb much of the various delineations of geologic time aside from Precambrian and everything that came after - but in context to how long people have been around - it really puts things in perspective. The the history of earth were the length of \"Stairway to Heaven\" we would be part of of one of the syllables of Plant's last utterance of the word Heaven as the song ends - maybe not even that much. There were some very eye opening things that I never knew about as well as far as how North America came together. I was always under the impression that we just sort of floated away from Pangeia or the first continent and that was it - apparently not. The chapter on California was really interesting as well regarding faults and earthquakes, the gold rush, etc. It was just a really cool book if you like earth sciences. If you don't? stick with a novel because this will be some work for you."

I really enjoyed the science and the storytelling, but the book often spent too much time using words it hadn't defined and too little time telling stories about processes. My favorite parts were the vignettes connecting geology to history - the gold miners in the Sierra Nevadas, the cowboys in Wyoming, even the vacationers in the Delaware Water Gap. (I was disappointed that this vignette was missing from the final \"book,\" Crossing the Craton .) Each book also introduced a new geological phenomenon, which were the parts I suspect I'll remember best. Other parts were tougher to finish. I often struggled to follow the long passages describing how specific geographical places came to be - describing rocks being shoved up, eroding, being covered, flipping, and deformed by other rocks. I get that this is how geology works, but it doesn't always translate to the written page. Also, as I said in my review for \"Assembling California,\" I'd love to see more pictures and maps. However, for all my complaints, I am now a geology fan and have a much deeper appreciation for the earth around me. I'd guess that's what John McPhee would have wanted me to get out of it."

John McPhee began to wonder about these roadcuts and over several years compiled a geologic history of the United States through interviews and feild trips with geology professors from New York to San Francisco. His epic adventure immerses readers in deep deep time, a complex poetry of terminology, and a fascinating array of personal stories. He continually reconnects the geology of the narrative to the reader through frequent references to history and periodic sprinklings of wry humor. And it's not all geology; You'll be amazed by Geologist David Love's family history and thrilled and appalled at the rapid-fire recounts of experiences of the Loma Prieta earthquake of 1988, when slabs of double-decker highway dropped onto commuter vehicles and Candlestick Park shook duriing the world Series. This is not a strictly layman's book. The language is dense, the concepts unfamiliar, and the few illustrations, diagrams and maps insufficient to clarify much of the text. However, McPhee possesses the sensibilities of both journalist and poet. While the reader may have to soldier through ignornance and inexperience at times, the 660 page journey creates a satisfying understanding of the precepts and questions posed by geologists and geology and a grounding sense of the theory of geological time and the formation of the surface of our planet. Overall, it makes me feel small and ephemeral."

My favorite parts are where McPhee weaves place and people, or people and ideas together and establishes the grand metaphor for his book.

        "text":"Once upon a time I was a geology student. In gloomy Victorian halls and on sunny limestone outcrops we tried to get siltstones and schists and garnets to sing to us, to reveal their secrets. Sadly, as in all the sciences, many geologists aren't very good storytellers. That's why we have John McPhee. Through his prose, mountains tell their stories. While the stories collected in Annals of the Former World, don't compare to his masterful The Control of Nature, their still pretty wonderful. Geology is the centerpiece, but it's also biography, human history, and aesthetics. Landscape is no longer two-dimensional, but four-dimensional and visionary."

        "text":"\"Geologists, in their all but closed conversation, inhabit scenes that no one ever saw, scenes of global sweep, gone and gone again, including seas, mountains, rivers, forests, and archipelagoes of aching beauty rising in volcanic violence to settle down quietly and then forever disappear—almost disappear.” “If by some fiat I had to restrict all this writing to one sentence, this is the one I would choose: The summit of Mt. Everest is marine limestone.” My first review will be in Annals and then I will review the rest in the individual books. I may be cheating by doing it this way, but in this reread I have a lot I want to talk about and there are restrictions on characters in these reviews and I am running up against them. I found that out with Annie Dillard’s Pilgrim at Tinker Creek, where I tried to not only immortalize her words, but talk about how they made me feel and think and ran out of room. So, I am rereading the whole canon, Annals of the Former World, but reviewing each book separately, which they are technically separate books, so technically not cheating by claiming each one separately. And I feel that I am writing the way Mr. McPhee writes, in grand sentences, and with grand ideas, and with caveats and humor, and must apologize for the copycatting. I also think that talking, reading, and thinking about geology does this to me. Mr. McPhee is credited with opening a huge new interest in geology in us laypeople. I have to credit it more emphatically to Annie Dillard, who has 2 examples of “big picture” geology and deep time, one like a lyrical waking dream, and the other an artist’s interpretation of time: “Mountains burst up, jutting, and dull and soften before your eyes, clothed in forests like felt. The ice rolls up, grinding green land under water forever; the ice rolls back.\" I have never been the same, always attuned to the geopoetry of this way of looking at the world, and seeing the links between Dillard and McPhee in my worldview. An example of what it does goes like this: I read a sentence such as “There was glaciation in the Southern Hemisphere at the time.” And my mind is blown, why in the Ice Ages was there so little glaciation in the Southern Hemisphere? Antarctica is obviously a fertile field for glaciers, how have I never though of this? Why was there in this period he is talking about? McPhee drops information like this often, and sometimes answers the question I have, sometimes not, this being a throw away sentence, so I have to pause and start googling. What a world we live in, to have this information at our fingertips, literally. This is the type of thinking that makes kids into scientists, so I am first, thrilled I can have that innocence of wonder and awe, and secondly, that also makes poets, and that is why this is such a source of joy for me. ”The poles of the earth have wandered. The equator has apparently moved. The continents, perched on their plates, are thought to have been carried so very far and to be going in so many directions that it seems an act of almost pure hubris to assert that some landmark of our world is fixed at 73 degrees 57 minutes and 53 seconds west longitude and 40 degrees 51 minutes and 14 seconds north latitude—a temporary description, at any rate, as if for a boat on the sea.” This opening is so similar to Annie Dillard’s style that I was hooked from the minute I picked up the 734 page book. I don’t think he is copying her, he just has that sense of what hooks a reader and how to plant a thought that all of us wanderers and armchair wanderers muse about from time to time; where is this place we have been set down? There is a new interactive map ( https:\/\/dinosaurpictures.org\/ancient-... ) that will demonstrate where whatever place you are interested in has been in the past 20 million, 75 million, 400 million, etc. years you are interested in, and it is like McPhee got that in his head from his travels over 20 years with geologists. ” You are in central Nevada, about four hundred miles east of San Francisco, and after you have climbed these mountains you look out upon (as it appears in present theory) open sea. You drop swiftly to the coast, and then move on across moderately profound water full of pelagic squid, water that is quietly accumulating the sediments which—ages in the future—will become the roof rock of the rising Sierra. Tall volcanoes are standing in the sea. Then, at roughly the point where the Sierran foothills will end and the Great Valley will begin—at Auburn, California—you move beyond the shelf and over deep ocean. There are probably some islands out there somewhere, but fundamentally you are crossing above ocean crustal floor that reaches to the China Sea. Below you there is no hint of North America, no hint of the valley or the hills where Sacramento and San Francisco will be.” These passages are one of the main hooks for me, as I travelled across the country several times, only a few by I80 but it is not necessary for the idea, the inspiration. McPhee places the geology in my sense of place and on the land instead of a theoretical or obscure science. I love long distance driving, I love being so close to the land and looking up at the sky; I feel as close to flying on the ground as you can be, and McPhee’s descriptions do nearly the same thing. Land and mountains seem so sure, so permanent, but we know they are not. They become sand. And after that, they sink and are piled upon by sediment to become rock again, and then sand again. So the basic building block of our planet is a grain of sand. Annie Dillard does an thought experiment of looking at a bird, and trying to visualize it becoming defeathered and de-evolved into a lizard and then back again; my favorite is while in a talus filed, or a sand dune field under mountains, to visualize them building up into mountains and then dissolving again in time; and that is why geology is the “music of the earth,” per Hans Cloos. Or as the author describes why he chose I80, it “avoids melodrama, avoids the Grand Canyons, the Jackson Holes, the geologic operas of the country, but it would surely be a sound experience of the big picture, of the history, the construction, the components of the continent. And in all likelihood it would display in its roadcuts rock from every epoch and era.” ”Slowly disassemble the Rocky Mountains and carry the material in small fragments to the Mississippi Delta. The delta builds down. It presses ever deeper on the mantle. Its depth at the moment exceeds twenty-five thousand feet. The heat and the pressure are so great down there that the silt is turning into siltstone, the sand into sandstone, the mud into shale. The Gulf of Mexico was a good example of a geosyncline, with a large part of the Rocky Mountains sitting in it as more than twenty-five thousand feet of silt, sand, and mud, siltstone, sandstone, and shale.” I hiked in the Mount Evans Wilderness recently, along a creek that was carving out the basement rock of the fourteener, and came across a rock outcrop that had an alcove below and a hanging garden above, and it was a wall of the trail, essentially and again, was drawn into a meditation of the mountain crumbling into these giant rocks who live with us for a while and then crumble into smaller stones, and then sand. It is a way of seeing I love. At the same time, beneath my feet, the sand and dirt I walk upon is putting pressure on the detritus of the mountains below us, and rock is being born. McPhee is a translator of sorts, as he says and then alchemizes it: “Geologists, in their all but closed conversation, inhabit scenes that no one ever saw, scenes of global sweep, gone and gone again, including seas, mountains, rivers, forests, and archipelagoes of aching beauty rising in volcanic violence to settle down quietly and then forever disappear—almost disappear.” This book is one of my favorite of the series, and contains the narrative description of what McPhee coined as “deep time.” He writes about the history of geology in an alive, engaging way I wish all historians could try; and as he describes James Hutton, the Scottish father of modern geology, Hutton “had no way of knowing that there were seventy million years just in the line that separated the two kinds of rock, and many millions more in the story of each formation—but he sensed something like it, sensed the awesome truth, and as he stood there staring at the riverbank he was seeing it for all humankind.” If you don’t get chills from that visual, I am sorry. To see something, to sense it, based on your eyes and mind, for all of humankind is a holy moment. “It was at some moment in the Pleistocene that humanity crossed what the geologist-theologian Pierre Teilhard de Chardin called the Threshold of Reflection, when something in people “turned back on itself and so to speak took an infinite leap forward. Outwardly, almost nothing in the organs had changed. But in depth, a great revolution had taken place: consciousness was now leaping and boiling in a space of super-sensory relationships and representations; and simultaneously consciousness was capable of perceiving itself in the concentrated simplicity of its faculties. And all this happened for the first time.” Annie Dillard wrote in 1974 and then in 1990 in more depth, about Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, so I was delighted he is in Basin and Range. Teilhard was a paleontologist, priest and philosopher and my main mantra in life is attributed to him: : \"Throughout my whole life, during every minute of it, the world has been gradually lighting up and blazing before my eyes until it has come to surround me, entirely lit up from within.\" When I read about the Threshold of Reflection, I wished I was there. In my mind, it links to the immortalized footsteps found in Tanzania where Mary Leakey found a trail of hominid footprints, as Dillard writes in For the Time Being: “They walked on moist volcanic tuff and ash. We have a record of those few seconds from a day about 3.6 million years ago—More ash covered the footprints and hardened like plaster. Ash also preserved the pockmarks of the raindrops that fell beside the three who walked: it was a rainy day. We do not know why the woman paused and turned left, briefly, before continuing. “A remote ancestor,” Leakey said, “experienced a moment of doubt.” Possibly they watched the Sadiman volcano erupting, or they took a last look back before they left. We do know we cannot make anything so lasting as these three barefoot ones did.” Perhaps they became conscious of themselves as conscious beings in that moment, meaning, perhaps, we were all there. McPhee writes, “The mind seemed to grow giddy by looking so far into the abyss of time.” Why yes, yes it did, and it still does, maybe always. Some deep time analogies: ”Geologists will sometimes use the calendar year as a unit to represent the time scale, and in such terms the Precambrian runs from New Year’s Day until well after Halloween. Dinosaurs appear in the middle of December and are gone the day after Christmas. The last ice sheet melts on December 31st at one minute before midnight, and the Roman Empire lasts five seconds.” “With your arms spread wide again to represent all time on earth, look at one hand with its line of life. The Cambrian begins in the wrist, and the Permian Extinction is at the outer end of the palm. All of the Cenozoic is in a fingerprint, and in a single stroke with a medium-grained nail file you could eradicate human history.” “The human consciousness may have begun to leap and boil some sunny day in the Pleistocene, but the race by and large has retained the essence of its animal sense of time. People think in five generations—two ahead, two behind—with heavy concentration on the one in the middle. Possibly that is tragic, and possibly there is no choice. The human mind may not have evolved enough to be able to comprehend deep time. It may only be able to measure it.” Going into the deep time meditation a little differently, about the spans of time in either direction, I loved these imageries: “There is no younger rock in the United States than the travertine that is forming in Thermopolis, Wyoming. A 2.7-billion-year-old outcrop of the core of the continent is at the head of Wind River Canyon, twenty miles away.” “And in the deep shadow below the Cambrian were seven years for everyone in all subsequent time. There were four billion years back there—since the earliest beginnings of the world.” “In six thousand years, you could never grow wings on a reptile. With sixty million, however, you could have feathers, too.” “On the geologic time scale, a human lifetime is reduced to a brevity that is too inhibiting to think about. The mind blocks the information. Geologists, dealing always with deep time, find that it seeps into their beings and affects them in various ways: “Mammalian species last, typically, two million years. We’ve about used up ours. Every time Leakey finds something older, I say, ‘Oh! We’re overdue.’ We will be handing the dominant-species-on-earth position to some other group. We’ll have to be clever not to.” “If you free yourself from the conventional reaction to a quantity like a million years, you free yourself a bit from the boundaries of human time. And then in a way you do not live at all, but in another way you live forever.”"

Your road trip will become something entirely different if you can see what you're reading about. #3. Read these books when you're planning a trip to any of the areas discussed. #4. Just read them. John McPhee does connect things better than most writers of text about geology. He makes it accessible while also staying interesting for those \"in the know.\" And the people who are part of the geologic history of a place, like the mappers and surveyers are not mere footnotes in his writing.

        "text":"This book has a rhythm unlike anything else I've read, just like geology has a timescale that takes some time to wrap your head around. It's like an opera. Geology and opera both have a reputation of being long and boring, but they are also majestic and complex. This book is long, but it's not boring! For a while, when I first started this book, my three-year-old wanted me to read every other page to her--the words were like poetry. You can't read it quickly. Reading out loud helped me settle down to the book's pace. There are lots of big words: some of the geology geek persuasion, others of the English major nerd variety...but I wasn't constantly reaching for a dictionary. McPhee throws a new geology term at you, repeats it in multiple contexts so that you get a sense of the thing, and then offers a more complete definition, just in case you still need help. It's engaging. At first I was a little bothered by the lack of photographs of everything. McPhee uses a thousand words to make a picture, but I still wouldn't recognize welded tuff if it was right in front of me. I wanted a modernized, six minute YouTube clip series complete with reality TV interviews with the geologists right at the road cut...I'm not sure I would have savored that as much though. And also, the ideas still get through. I don't want to be a geologist, and I don't need to memorize what all the rocks look like. But I have a much better picture of the complexities of the idea of plate tectonics, what it explains, what it doesn't. And while I'm sure some of the ideas presented in the book are dated, the big picture of geology hasn't changed too much from the public's perspective in the last twenty some-odd years. Each book described some section of geology along Interstate 80, as well as the background of the geologist that McPhee accompanies during that stretch of land. (You really don't have to read the books in order, if you don't want to.) Rising from the Plains was my favorite. The geologist, David Love, had a childhood much like Ralph Moody (who wrote the Little Britches series), and Love's story is woven into the geology of Wyoming beautifully. What an adventure!"

        "text":"This entire book is an artifact from another era, an era when scientific writing for the general reader was undergoing some necessary upgrades. Unfortunately, that is exactly how it reads—as a stylistically interstitial relic. In recent years, science writing has largely eschewed jargon, verbiage, and writerly flourishes—focusing instead on comprehension and simplicity. This book is not simple. It does not eschew verbiage, flourishes, or scientific nomenclature. Furthermore, it is cavalierly uninterested in aiding reader comprehension. After reading 660 pages on the geology of North America, my ignorance of the subject is undiminished. I studied a little geology in college (in Wyoming, no less). I have traveled extensively throughout North America, and the terrain covered in the book (I-80 and environs, principally) is quite familiar to me. Yet I often could not picture in my mind’s eye what McPhee was describing. For whatever reason, this book was published with almost no visual aids. That is inexcusable for a deeply complex book about geology, let alone one ostensibly written for the general reader. Wikipedia entries on lithospheric phenomena are pure pleasure reading by comparison. There were, to be sure, portions of text that were smooth, enlightening, and easy to follow. Such section were rare. Midway through the book, I switched from a paperback to a Kindle version because the ability to look up obscure terms became essential. Why? Because McPhee does nothing whatsoever to ensure the reader understands what he’s talking about. He just throws scientific terms at you as if they are in everyday use and moves on. He says that something “inclines” but doesn’t tell you what he’s referring to, where it is, or what the “incline” is inclined toward. This book (which is really five books in one) has many fans and it has won many prizes. Well done. I found it exhausting."

In an attempt to remedy that, I did some brief research and came up with this book. I got the book for the Geology, I stayed for the writing. This book could be measured in pounds. The premise: seven hundred pages of nonfiction geology in United States. It sounded only slightly drier than dust, and I approached it warily. I was delightfully wrong. John McPhee's craft reminds me most of Steinbeck. (Side note, this may be the nudge up get me to finally read Steinbeck's nonfiction that's been on my shelf for years.) His book is a tapestry of character sketches and history, storytelling and journalism. I wanted to meet old geologists, and drive in a pickup truck across I-80 and drink coffee and look at rocks. Although it's technically scientific journalism, this book moved me like a story. Actually, it had more flavors and savors than much of the fiction I read. As the quote on the back cover by A O Scott says \"a deep philology of the continent... surely a classic.\" I agree. I'm delighted that this book won a pulitzer prize, and I will this again."

Its a compilation of all of McPhee's writings about American continental Geology. I know, sounds dull, but he uses the lives and characters of the Geologists whose work he is describing along with the massive narrative arc of plate tectonics and the history of the science itself. The story of America's westward expansion along with the Romantic era of northeastern America all seem to blend into a text that can miraculously also explain geomorphology and other remarkably dry topics. Gives the vast expanses of time a tiny human scale which we can then wonder at how our ancestors saw these places as well as the painstaking detective work that was critical to our understanding of how they formed, where these places came from and how in something as seemingly stolid as the ground beneath our feet is a plastic and still changing skin manipulated by forces beyond human comprehension. Utterly beautiful work–I know of nothing else like it."

        "text":"One of the geologist-contacts of John McPhee explains the impact his professional life has on his perspective: \"You care less about civilization. Half of me gets upset with civilization. The other half does not get upset. I shrug and think, So let the cockroaches take over.\" This, in a nutshell, is the escapism offered by this particular Pulitzer-winning magnum opus. Yeah, that CO2 buildup and our plastic debris will leave a permanent mark, but four billion years of rocks don't care about your pandemic anxiety. The volume is a collection of five books written by McPhee between 1978 and 1999 aimed at describing not only the rock exposed in roadcuts across the United States but also the geologists with whom he traveled. Because I borrowed the e-book from the library, I confess I had no idea I was delving into such a massive volume until I was probably 30 pages in. But at that point, I was hooked. Not that I always knew what McPhee was talking about. There was fatigued rock and incompetent rock and inequigranular fabric in rock. If you bent or folded rock, the inside of the curve was in a state of compression, the outside of the curve was under great tension, and somewhere in the middle was the surface of no strain -- the two sides were active in every fault. The inclination of a slope on which boulders would stay put was the angle of repose. Jargon can be poetic. There were festooned crossbeds and limestone sinks, pillow lavas and petrified trees, incised meanders and defeated streams. There were dike swarms and slickensides, explosion pits, volcanic bombs. Pulsating glaciers. Hogbacks. Radiolarian ooze. And while I probably read the word batholith fifty times without ever bothering to look it up, through all the texture McPhee imparts wonderfully not only five books' worth of geological knowledge, he builds throughout the volume, offering deeper perspectives in the later books. The setup is far from linear. You don't start in the east and end up in California. You jump around. But you do benefit from the fact that in the 20-year period McPhee wrote these books, his understanding of the evolution of the field as the plate tectonics revolution unfolded also grew. Plate tectonics became universally accepted in the '60s, only a few years before the first volume was written. By the '90s, a flourishing of understanding based on technology including isotopes and gravity fields and magnetic fields had brought to light so much more than when he started. One aspect of the writing that makes it come alive is the fact that it's about geologists as much as it's about geology. McPhee describes the geology only in the context of the dedicated men and women who live for the study. \"We are blind men feeling the elephant,\" David Love, of the Geological Survey, has said to me at least fifty times, he writes, referencing the Hindu fable of the blind men touching only one small piece of the creature while trying to infer the whole of it. The foremost problem with the Picture is that ninety-nine per cent of it is missing -- melted or dissolved, torn down, washed away, broken to bits, to become something else in the Picture. The geologist discovers lingering remains, and connects them with dotted lines. Geologists \"try to put the petals back on the flower.\" The ideal scenario for reading this book would be during a cross-country trip across I-80. But absent that real field experience, I found myself pulling up countless YouTube videos to accompany my reading, which enabled me to better visualize a lot of what McPhee describes. Plate tectonics is the star of the show, the framework around which everything else occurs. But the whole of the story is much more complex. Specific geologies are complex and messy. The Appalachians, for example, weren't simply formed the way the Himalayas are today, by two plates violently colliding. They were more the result of a schedule of arrivals of incoming exotic terranes – multiple collisions – over a long spread of time. \"Hotspots\" determine new island arcs and may even help cause continents to split. A thin crust and upraised mantle facilitate basin-and-range formation in Nevada today. Ice sheets set up and started Niagara Falls, moved the Ohio River, dug the Great Lakes. There was continental rifting below Nebraska and Iowa 1.1 billion years ago that stopped before it could turn to ocean. Pokagon State Park, Indiana is made of Canadian rocks, red jasper conglomerates from the north shore of Lake Huron, banded gray gneisses from central Ontario. Boston is African rock and the north of Ireland is American. Some other morsels: In any rock column, more time is missing than present, because erosion is a bigger driving force than orogeny (the building of mountains). And rock columns are more likely to commemorate a moment – a flood, an eruption – than to report a millennium. Like a news broadcast, it is more often a montage of disasters than a cumulative record of time. I visited the Grand Canyon at the age of thirteen. The park is uniquely suited to hitting visitors over the head with what McPhee calls its \"layer-cake\" geology, a gorgeous and linear time scale. But geology is rarely so accommodating. Rock isn't just laid down. It is turned on its side or upside-down. It metamorphosizes and gets moved thousands of miles. It melds with other rocks. The complexity is staggering. The whole Appalachian system continually fed upon itself. There are Precambrian pebbles, in Silurian rock. You'll see Silurian pebbles in Devonian rock, Devonian pebbles in Mississippian rock. Geology repeats itself. Even the wind can play an outsized role in favor of erosion. McPhee describes how a substantial amount of erosion from the Rocky mountains might end up as dust blown by storms into the North Atlantic Ocean. Oil deposits are correlated with conodont fossils of a particular hue. The presence of conodonts in the rock is an indicator of their being the right age, and the color of the fossils is in indication of the level of compression the rocks have undergone, a determinant of oil formation from carbon deposits. California is in large part a collection and compactation of oceanic islands. The \"Smartville arc\" brought gold to California. Toward the end of the middle Jurassic – in the high noon of the dinosaurs, about a hundred and sixty-five million years ago – an island arc like the Aleutians or Japan had moved in from the western ocean and docked here. This was the third terrane at this latitude: the one that followed Sonomia and smashed into it with crumpling, mountain-building effects that propogated eastward turning soils into phyllites, sandstones into quartzites, siltstones into slates – the metamorphics we had seen up the road. In aggregate, the three terranes extended the continent by at least four hundred miles. The third one, suturing here, had doubled the width of what is now California. … If the story of California sounds fantastic, with all its accreting arcs and melanges coming up from the western sea, just look at a map of the southwest Pacific – look at the relationship between Australia and Indonesia right now. [Hot spots] Great Meteor and Cape Verde seem to have lifted New England's high mountains, Bermuda the Smokies. Uplift accelerates erosion. The rock of the Permian period – the last chapter in the Appalachian mountain building story – has been removed everywhere in eastern America except in West Virginia and nearby parts of Ohio and Pennsylvania, halfway between the hot-spot tracks, halfway between New Hampshire and North Carolina. An ophiolite is a section of the Earth's oceanic crust and the underlying upper mantle that has been uplifted and exposed above sea level and often emplaced onto continental crustal rocks. The presence of ophiolites – which we see in California, among other places – is a consequence of continental collisions with oceanic plates. One geologist likened the ophiolite to a cow on a cowcatcher in front of an old western train. The earth as a whole is producing progressively less heat from radioactive decay, and that, at some point, is going to have a profound effect. In the future, the profound effect is going to be that the plates will stop moving. The plate tectonics revolution isn't the only recent revolution in geology. The ability to identify the age of rocks is significantly more advanced than it was in the day when the presence of fossils were the main yardstick. Iron minerals line up like compasses, pointing toward the changing magnetic poles. Isotope decay rates are known and constant. Rock types can be identified by their magnetic signatures. The magnetic field is sampling the shallow crust, the upper few thousand feet. The gravity field is averaging, basically, the whole lithosphere. When you look at a gravity map you are seeing deeper features of the crust. One problem with writing about science is that as any book is written, it immediately is threatened with obsolescence. McPhee observed, The thought occurs to me, not for the first time, that I am following a science as it lurches forward from error to discovery and back to error. But this is actually as much an asset of the writing as it is a detraction. I expect this volume will be worth reading even a hundred years from now because it is not just a textbook. It's written in the form of journeys, set pieces, flashbacks, biographical sketches, and histories of the human and lithic kind . And at the same time, it offers discovery and insight."

For the average joe to pick this up and read through it would be a battle - especially if the subject doesn't interest him. But as Dennis Hopper said to Chris Walken in True Romance \"this shit fascinates me.\" Different subject matter - same principle. I've always liked rocks and the thought of what went on before we got here - why things are the way they are - and what is going to continue long after we are gone has a certain appeal. There's a certain comfort that comes in reading about something that doesn't give a shit about the Dow Jones, ISIS, Obama, American Idol and the Superbowl. It's a planet doing it's thing and there's nothing you can do to stop it. It's not a predictive science. The geologic history in this book is interwoven with man's history in this country as it relates to the areas across a specific latitude of the US. Though there is a lot of rocks to wade through I really enjoyed the book. I probably didn't absorb much of the various delineations of geologic time aside from Precambrian and everything that came after - but in context to how long people have been around - it really puts things in perspective. The the history of earth were the length of \"Stairway to Heaven\" we would be part of of one of the syllables of Plant's last utterance of the word Heaven as the song ends - maybe not even that much. There were some very eye opening things that I never knew about as well as far as how North America came together. I was always under the impression that we just sort of floated away from Pangeia or the first continent and that was it - apparently not. The chapter on California was really interesting as well regarding faults and earthquakes, the gold rush, etc. It was just a really cool book if you like earth sciences. If you don't? stick with a novel because this will be some work for you."

I really enjoyed the science and the storytelling, but the book often spent too much time using words it hadn't defined and too little time telling stories about processes. My favorite parts were the vignettes connecting geology to history - the gold miners in the Sierra Nevadas, the cowboys in Wyoming, even the vacationers in the Delaware Water Gap. (I was disappointed that this vignette was missing from the final \"book,\" Crossing the Craton .) Each book also introduced a new geological phenomenon, which were the parts I suspect I'll remember best. Other parts were tougher to finish. I often struggled to follow the long passages describing how specific geographical places came to be - describing rocks being shoved up, eroding, being covered, flipping, and deformed by other rocks. I get that this is how geology works, but it doesn't always translate to the written page. Also, as I said in my review for \"Assembling California,\" I'd love to see more pictures and maps. However, for all my complaints, I am now a geology fan and have a much deeper appreciation for the earth around me. I'd guess that's what John McPhee would have wanted me to get out of it."

John McPhee began to wonder about these roadcuts and over several years compiled a geologic history of the United States through interviews and feild trips with geology professors from New York to San Francisco. His epic adventure immerses readers in deep deep time, a complex poetry of terminology, and a fascinating array of personal stories. He continually reconnects the geology of the narrative to the reader through frequent references to history and periodic sprinklings of wry humor. And it's not all geology; You'll be amazed by Geologist David Love's family history and thrilled and appalled at the rapid-fire recounts of experiences of the Loma Prieta earthquake of 1988, when slabs of double-decker highway dropped onto commuter vehicles and Candlestick Park shook duriing the world Series. This is not a strictly layman's book. The language is dense, the concepts unfamiliar, and the few illustrations, diagrams and maps insufficient to clarify much of the text. However, McPhee possesses the sensibilities of both journalist and poet. While the reader may have to soldier through ignornance and inexperience at times, the 660 page journey creates a satisfying understanding of the precepts and questions posed by geologists and geology and a grounding sense of the theory of geological time and the formation of the surface of our planet. Overall, it makes me feel small and ephemeral."

The result is a satisfying read that doesn't insult the intelligence of the reader because, above all else, his writing style is both informative AND entertaining, without any need to \"dumb it down\" into monosyllabic pap. The story unfolds kaleidoscopically, beginning in New Jersey, then away to the West along Highway 81, through many unlikely times and places such as an old silent-era Mack Sennett movie, Butch Cassidy's Hole-In-The-Wall gang and a world series baseball game interrupted by a devastating earthquake, and even a multi-million-dollar silver find in what was suppoed to be an exhausted tailings pile. From the professor of geology trying to inspire fresh new minds in the classroom to the weekend rock hound, to the armchair surfer just looking for a thick and well written tome to help pass rainy days, this book is an excellent choice."

Composed of five books, each tackling a discrete piece of time and space, this anthology crisscrosses the continent and in the process elucidates not just the distant past, but also the rich characters who are now piecing together its story. Impeccably researched, written in a style that is precise without being overly technical, and with just the right ratio of humor to gravitas, McPhee’s prose shines. This is one heck of a book.

But McPhee takes you into the lives of his geologist guides, teaches you about the big breakthroughs in the science, and takes you through some geological events, some slow (like orogeny, one of my new favorite words) and some fast (the Loma Prieta earthquake). You learn a lot, but there are poetical passages in which he just lets the luscious, metaphorical terminology of the science wash over you; don't try to understand every paragraph word-for-word.

My favorite parts are where McPhee weaves place and people, or people and ideas together and establishes the grand metaphor for his book. McPhee picks up pieces of conversation with geologists and their satelites that might get missed by most other writers, but manages to find, keep and eventually place these nuggets into his book (written over 20 years) in a way that works to support his big themes. Seriously, this book is one of my favorite nonfiction works of all time. You can see the mark McPhee left on his students' writing if you've ever read Robert Wright , Richard Preston or New Yorker editor David Remnick .

Everest is marine limestone.” My first review will be in Annals and then I will review the rest in the individual books. I may be cheating by doing it this way, but in this reread I have a lot I want to talk about and there are restrictions on characters in these reviews and I am running up against them. I found that out with Annie Dillard’s Pilgrim at Tinker Creek, where I tried to not only immortalize her words, but talk about how they made me feel and think and ran out of room. So, I am rereading the whole canon, Annals of the Former World, but reviewing each book separately, which they are technically separate books, so technically not cheating by claiming each one separately. And I feel that I am writing the way Mr. McPhee writes, in grand sentences, and with grand ideas, and with caveats and humor, and must apologize for the copycatting. I also think that talking, reading, and thinking about geology does this to me. Mr. McPhee is credited with opening a huge new interest in geology in us laypeople. I have to credit it more emphatically to Annie Dillard, who has 2 examples of “big picture” geology and deep time, one like a lyrical waking dream, and the other an artist’s interpretation of time: “Mountains burst up, jutting, and dull and soften before your eyes, clothed in forests like felt. The ice rolls up, grinding green land under water forever; the ice rolls back.\" I have never been the same, always attuned to the geopoetry of this way of looking at the world, and seeing the links between Dillard and McPhee in my worldview. An example of what it does goes like this: I read a sentence such as “There was glaciation in the Southern Hemisphere at the time.” And my mind is blown, why in the Ice Ages was there so little glaciation in the Southern Hemisphere? Antarctica is obviously a fertile field for glaciers, how have I never though of this? Why was there in this period he is talking about? McPhee drops information like this often, and sometimes answers the question I have, sometimes not, this being a throw away sentence, so I have to pause and start googling. What a world we live in, to have this information at our fingertips, literally. This is the type of thinking that makes kids into scientists, so I am first, thrilled I can have that innocence of wonder and awe, and secondly, that also makes poets, and that is why this is such a source of joy for me. ”The poles of the earth have wandered. The equator has apparently moved. The continents, perched on their plates, are thought to have been carried so very far and to be going in so many directions that it seems an act of almost pure hubris to assert that some landmark of our world is fixed at 73 degrees 57 minutes and 53 seconds west longitude and 40 degrees 51 minutes and 14 seconds north latitude—a temporary description, at any rate, as if for a boat on the sea.” This opening is so similar to Annie Dillard’s style that I was hooked from the minute I picked up the 734 page book. I don’t think he is copying her, he just has that sense of what hooks a reader and how to plant a thought that all of us wanderers and armchair wanderers muse about from time to time; where is this place we have been set down? There is a new interactive map ( https:\/\/dinosaurpictures.org\/ancient-... ) that will demonstrate where whatever place you are interested in has been in the past 20 million, 75 million, 400 million, etc. years you are interested in, and it is like McPhee got that in his head from his travels over 20 years with geologists. ” You are in central Nevada, about four hundred miles east of San Francisco, and after you have climbed these mountains you look out upon (as it appears in present theory) open sea. You drop swiftly to the coast, and then move on across moderately profound water full of pelagic squid, water that is quietly accumulating the sediments which—ages in the future—will become the roof rock of the rising Sierra. Tall volcanoes are standing in the sea. Then, at roughly the point where the Sierran foothills will end and the Great Valley will begin—at Auburn, California—you move beyond the shelf and over deep ocean. There are probably some islands out there somewhere, but fundamentally you are crossing above ocean crustal floor that reaches to the China Sea. Below you there is no hint of North America, no hint of the valley or the hills where Sacramento and San Francisco will be.” These passages are one of the main hooks for me, as I travelled across the country several times, only a few by I80 but it is not necessary for the idea, the inspiration. McPhee places the geology in my sense of place and on the land instead of a theoretical or obscure science. I love long distance driving, I love being so close to the land and looking up at the sky; I feel as close to flying on the ground as you can be, and McPhee’s descriptions do nearly the same thing. Land and mountains seem so sure, so permanent, but we know they are not. They become sand. And after that, they sink and are piled upon by sediment to become rock again, and then sand again. So the basic building block of our planet is a grain of sand. Annie Dillard does an thought experiment of looking at a bird, and trying to visualize it becoming defeathered and de-evolved into a lizard and then back again; my favorite is while in a talus filed, or a sand dune field under mountains, to visualize them building up into mountains and then dissolving again in time; and that is why geology is the “music of the earth,” per Hans Cloos. Or as the author describes why he chose I80, it “avoids melodrama, avoids the Grand Canyons, the Jackson Holes, the geologic operas of the country, but it would surely be a sound experience of the big picture, of the history, the construction, the components of the continent. And in all likelihood it would display in its roadcuts rock from every epoch and era.” ”Slowly disassemble the Rocky Mountains and carry the material in small fragments to the Mississippi Delta. The delta builds down. It presses ever deeper on the mantle. Its depth at the moment exceeds twenty-five thousand feet. The heat and the pressure are so great down there that the silt is turning into siltstone, the sand into sandstone, the mud into shale. The Gulf of Mexico was a good example of a geosyncline, with a large part of the Rocky Mountains sitting in it as more than twenty-five thousand feet of silt, sand, and mud, siltstone, sandstone, and shale.” I hiked in the Mount Evans Wilderness recently, along a creek that was carving out the basement rock of the fourteener, and came across a rock outcrop that had an alcove below and a hanging garden above, and it was a wall of the trail, essentially and again, was drawn into a meditation of the mountain crumbling into these giant rocks who live with us for a while and then crumble into smaller stones, and then sand. It is a way of seeing I love. At the same time, beneath my feet, the sand and dirt I walk upon is putting pressure on the detritus of the mountains below us, and rock is being born. McPhee is a translator of sorts, as he says and then alchemizes it: “Geologists, in their all but closed conversation, inhabit scenes that no one ever saw, scenes of global sweep, gone and gone again, including seas, mountains, rivers, forests, and archipelagoes of aching beauty rising in volcanic violence to settle down quietly and then forever disappear—almost disappear.” This book is one of my favorite of the series, and contains the narrative description of what McPhee coined as “deep time.” He writes about the history of geology in an alive, engaging way I wish all historians could try; and as he describes James Hutton, the Scottish father of modern geology, Hutton “had no way of knowing that there were seventy million years just in the line that separated the two kinds of rock, and many millions more in the story of each formation—but he sensed something like it, sensed the awesome truth, and as he stood there staring at the riverbank he was seeing it for all humankind.” If you don’t get chills from that visual, I am sorry. To see something, to sense it, based on your eyes and mind, for all of humankind is a holy moment. “It was at some moment in the Pleistocene that humanity crossed what the geologist-theologian Pierre Teilhard de Chardin called the Threshold of Reflection, when something in people “turned back on itself and so to speak took an infinite leap forward. Outwardly, almost nothing in the organs had changed. But in depth, a great revolution had taken place: consciousness was now leaping and boiling in a space of super-sensory relationships and representations; and simultaneously consciousness was capable of perceiving itself in the concentrated simplicity of its faculties. And all this happened for the first time.” Annie Dillard wrote in 1974 and then in 1990 in more depth, about Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, so I was delighted he is in Basin and Range. Teilhard was a paleontologist, priest and philosopher and my main mantra in life is attributed to him: : \"Throughout my whole life, during every minute of it, the world has been gradually lighting up and blazing before my eyes until it has come to surround me, entirely lit up from within.\" When I read about the Threshold of Reflection, I wished I was there. In my mind, it links to the immortalized footsteps found in Tanzania where Mary Leakey found a trail of hominid footprints, as Dillard writes in For the Time Being: “They walked on moist volcanic tuff and ash. We have a record of those few seconds from a day about 3.6 million years ago—More ash covered the footprints and hardened like plaster. Ash also preserved the pockmarks of the raindrops that fell beside the three who walked: it was a rainy day. We do not know why the woman paused and turned left, briefly, before continuing. “A remote ancestor,” Leakey said, “experienced a moment of doubt.” Possibly they watched the Sadiman volcano erupting, or they took a last look back before they left. We do know we cannot make anything so lasting as these three barefoot ones did.” Perhaps they became conscious of themselves as conscious beings in that moment, meaning, perhaps, we were all there. McPhee writes, “The mind seemed to grow giddy by looking so far into the abyss of time.” Why yes, yes it did, and it still does, maybe always. Some deep time analogies: ”Geologists will sometimes use the calendar year as a unit to represent the time scale, and in such terms the Precambrian runs from New Year’s Day until well after Halloween. Dinosaurs appear in the middle of December and are gone the day after Christmas. The last ice sheet melts on December 31st at one minute before midnight, and the Roman Empire lasts five seconds.” “With your arms spread wide again to represent all time on earth, look at one hand with its line of life. The Cambrian begins in the wrist, and the Permian Extinction is at the outer end of the palm. All of the Cenozoic is in a fingerprint, and in a single stroke with a medium-grained nail file you could eradicate human history.” “The human consciousness may have begun to leap and boil some sunny day in the Pleistocene, but the race by and large has retained the essence of its animal sense of time. People think in five generations—two ahead, two behind—with heavy concentration on the one in the middle. Possibly that is tragic, and possibly there is no choice. The human mind may not have evolved enough to be able to comprehend deep time. It may only be able to measure it.” Going into the deep time meditation a little differently, about the spans of time in either direction, I loved these imageries: “There is no younger rock in the United States than the travertine that is forming in Thermopolis, Wyoming. A 2.7-billion-year-old outcrop of the core of the continent is at the head of Wind River Canyon, twenty miles away.” “And in the deep shadow below the Cambrian were seven years for everyone in all subsequent time. There were four billion years back there—since the earliest beginnings of the world.” “In six thousand years, you could never grow wings on a reptile. With sixty million, however, you could have feathers, too.” “On the geologic time scale, a human lifetime is reduced to a brevity that is too inhibiting to think about. The mind blocks the information. Geologists, dealing always with deep time, find that it seeps into their beings and affects them in various ways: “Mammalian species last, typically, two million years. We’ve about used up ours. Every time Leakey finds something older, I say, ‘Oh! We’re overdue.’ We will be handing the dominant-species-on-earth position to some other group. We’ll have to be clever not to.” “If you free yourself from the conventional reaction to a quantity like a million years, you free yourself a bit from the boundaries of human time. And then in a way you do not live at all, but in another way you live forever.”"

Reading John McPhee is always a delight because he takes what remains mostly a poorly done body of work in mostly scientific terms and turns an explanation of how the earth came to be into a readable and engaging topic. Something just about anyone can enjoy provided they have the curiosity and interest in wondering how so much stunning geography came to be where it is and what it is. Well done John McPhee! Great Read!"

        "text":"This book has a rhythm unlike anything else I've read, just like geology has a timescale that takes some time to wrap your head around. It's like an opera. Geology and opera both have a reputation of being long and boring, but they are also majestic and complex. This book is long, but it's not boring! For a while, when I first started this book, my three-year-old wanted me to read every other page to her--the words were like poetry. You can't read it quickly. Reading out loud helped me settle down to the book's pace. There are lots of big words: some of the geology geek persuasion, others of the English major nerd variety...but I wasn't constantly reaching for a dictionary. McPhee throws a new geology term at you, repeats it in multiple contexts so that you get a sense of the thing, and then offers a more complete definition, just in case you still need help. It's engaging. At first I was a little bothered by the lack of photographs of everything. McPhee uses a thousand words to make a picture, but I still wouldn't recognize welded tuff if it was right in front of me. I wanted a modernized, six minute YouTube clip series complete with reality TV interviews with the geologists right at the road cut...I'm not sure I would have savored that as much though. And also, the ideas still get through. I don't want to be a geologist, and I don't need to memorize what all the rocks look like. But I have a much better picture of the complexities of the idea of plate tectonics, what it explains, what it doesn't. And while I'm sure some of the ideas presented in the book are dated, the big picture of geology hasn't changed too much from the public's perspective in the last twenty some-odd years. Each book described some section of geology along Interstate 80, as well as the background of the geologist that McPhee accompanies during that stretch of land. (You really don't have to read the books in order, if you don't want to.) Rising from the Plains was my favorite. The geologist, David Love, had a childhood much like Ralph Moody (who wrote the Little Britches series), and Love's story is woven into the geology of Wyoming beautifully. What an adventure!"

        "text":"This entire book is an artifact from another era, an era when scientific writing for the general reader was undergoing some necessary upgrades. Unfortunately, that is exactly how it reads—as a stylistically interstitial relic. In recent years, science writing has largely eschewed jargon, verbiage, and writerly flourishes—focusing instead on comprehension and simplicity. This book is not simple. It does not eschew verbiage, flourishes, or scientific nomenclature. Furthermore, it is cavalierly uninterested in aiding reader comprehension. After reading 660 pages on the geology of North America, my ignorance of the subject is undiminished. I studied a little geology in college (in Wyoming, no less). I have traveled extensively throughout North America, and the terrain covered in the book (I-80 and environs, principally) is quite familiar to me. Yet I often could not picture in my mind’s eye what McPhee was describing. For whatever reason, this book was published with almost no visual aids. That is inexcusable for a deeply complex book about geology, let alone one ostensibly written for the general reader. Wikipedia entries on lithospheric phenomena are pure pleasure reading by comparison. There were, to be sure, portions of text that were smooth, enlightening, and easy to follow. Such section were rare. Midway through the book, I switched from a paperback to a Kindle version because the ability to look up obscure terms became essential. Why? Because McPhee does nothing whatsoever to ensure the reader understands what he’s talking about. He just throws scientific terms at you as if they are in everyday use and moves on. He says that something “inclines” but doesn’t tell you what he’s referring to, where it is, or what the “incline” is inclined toward. This book (which is really five books in one) has many fans and it has won many prizes. Well done. I found it exhausting."

In an attempt to remedy that, I did some brief research and came up with this book. I got the book for the Geology, I stayed for the writing. This book could be measured in pounds. The premise: seven hundred pages of nonfiction geology in United States. It sounded only slightly drier than dust, and I approached it warily. I was delightfully wrong. John McPhee's craft reminds me most of Steinbeck. (Side note, this may be the nudge up get me to finally read Steinbeck's nonfiction that's been on my shelf for years.) His book is a tapestry of character sketches and history, storytelling and journalism. I wanted to meet old geologists, and drive in a pickup truck across I-80 and drink coffee and look at rocks. Although it's technically scientific journalism, this book moved me like a story. Actually, it had more flavors and savors than much of the fiction I read. As the quote on the back cover by A O Scott says \"a deep philology of the continent... surely a classic.\" I agree. I'm delighted that this book won a pulitzer prize, and I will this again."

Its a compilation of all of McPhee's writings about American continental Geology. I know, sounds dull, but he uses the lives and characters of the Geologists whose work he is describing along with the massive narrative arc of plate tectonics and the history of the science itself. The story of America's westward expansion along with the Romantic era of northeastern America all seem to blend into a text that can miraculously also explain geomorphology and other remarkably dry topics. Gives the vast expanses of time a tiny human scale which we can then wonder at how our ancestors saw these places as well as the painstaking detective work that was critical to our understanding of how they formed, where these places came from and how in something as seemingly stolid as the ground beneath our feet is a plastic and still changing skin manipulated by forces beyond human comprehension. Utterly beautiful work–I know of nothing else like it."

        "text":"One of the geologist-contacts of John McPhee explains the impact his professional life has on his perspective: \"You care less about civilization. Half of me gets upset with civilization. The other half does not get upset. I shrug and think, So let the cockroaches take over.\" This, in a nutshell, is the escapism offered by this particular Pulitzer-winning magnum opus. Yeah, that CO2 buildup and our plastic debris will leave a permanent mark, but four billion years of rocks don't care about your pandemic anxiety. The volume is a collection of five books written by McPhee between 1978 and 1999 aimed at describing not only the rock exposed in roadcuts across the United States but also the geologists with whom he traveled. Because I borrowed the e-book from the library, I confess I had no idea I was delving into such a massive volume until I was probably 30 pages in. But at that point, I was hooked. Not that I always knew what McPhee was talking about. There was fatigued rock and incompetent rock and inequigranular fabric in rock. If you bent or folded rock, the inside of the curve was in a state of compression, the outside of the curve was under great tension, and somewhere in the middle was the surface of no strain -- the two sides were active in every fault. The inclination of a slope on which boulders would stay put was the angle of repose. Jargon can be poetic. There were festooned crossbeds and limestone sinks, pillow lavas and petrified trees, incised meanders and defeated streams. There were dike swarms and slickensides, explosion pits, volcanic bombs. Pulsating glaciers. Hogbacks. Radiolarian ooze. And while I probably read the word batholith fifty times without ever bothering to look it up, through all the texture McPhee imparts wonderfully not only five books' worth of geological knowledge, he builds throughout the volume, offering deeper perspectives in the later books. The setup is far from linear. You don't start in the east and end up in California. You jump around. But you do benefit from the fact that in the 20-year period McPhee wrote these books, his understanding of the evolution of the field as the plate tectonics revolution unfolded also grew. Plate tectonics became universally accepted in the '60s, only a few years before the first volume was written. By the '90s, a flourishing of understanding based on technology including isotopes and gravity fields and magnetic fields had brought to light so much more than when he started. One aspect of the writing that makes it come alive is the fact that it's about geologists as much as it's about geology. McPhee describes the geology only in the context of the dedicated men and women who live for the study. \"We are blind men feeling the elephant,\" David Love, of the Geological Survey, has said to me at least fifty times, he writes, referencing the Hindu fable of the blind men touching only one small piece of the creature while trying to infer the whole of it. The foremost problem with the Picture is that ninety-nine per cent of it is missing -- melted or dissolved, torn down, washed away, broken to bits, to become something else in the Picture. The geologist discovers lingering remains, and connects them with dotted lines. Geologists \"try to put the petals back on the flower.\" The ideal scenario for reading this book would be during a cross-country trip across I-80. But absent that real field experience, I found myself pulling up countless YouTube videos to accompany my reading, which enabled me to better visualize a lot of what McPhee describes. Plate tectonics is the star of the show, the framework around which everything else occurs. But the whole of the story is much more complex. Specific geologies are complex and messy. The Appalachians, for example, weren't simply formed the way the Himalayas are today, by two plates violently colliding. They were more the result of a schedule of arrivals of incoming exotic terranes – multiple collisions – over a long spread of time. \"Hotspots\" determine new island arcs and may even help cause continents to split. A thin crust and upraised mantle facilitate basin-and-range formation in Nevada today. Ice sheets set up and started Niagara Falls, moved the Ohio River, dug the Great Lakes. There was continental rifting below Nebraska and Iowa 1.1 billion years ago that stopped before it could turn to ocean. Pokagon State Park, Indiana is made of Canadian rocks, red jasper conglomerates from the north shore of Lake Huron, banded gray gneisses from central Ontario. Boston is African rock and the north of Ireland is American. Some other morsels: In any rock column, more time is missing than present, because erosion is a bigger driving force than orogeny (the building of mountains). And rock columns are more likely to commemorate a moment – a flood, an eruption – than to report a millennium. Like a news broadcast, it is more often a montage of disasters than a cumulative record of time. I visited the Grand Canyon at the age of thirteen. The park is uniquely suited to hitting visitors over the head with what McPhee calls its \"layer-cake\" geology, a gorgeous and linear time scale. But geology is rarely so accommodating. Rock isn't just laid down. It is turned on its side or upside-down. It metamorphosizes and gets moved thousands of miles. It melds with other rocks. The complexity is staggering. The whole Appalachian system continually fed upon itself. There are Precambrian pebbles, in Silurian rock. You'll see Silurian pebbles in Devonian rock, Devonian pebbles in Mississippian rock. Geology repeats itself. Even the wind can play an outsized role in favor of erosion. McPhee describes how a substantial amount of erosion from the Rocky mountains might end up as dust blown by storms into the North Atlantic Ocean. Oil deposits are correlated with conodont fossils of a particular hue. The presence of conodonts in the rock is an indicator of their being the right age, and the color of the fossils is in indication of the level of compression the rocks have undergone, a determinant of oil formation from carbon deposits. California is in large part a collection and compactation of oceanic islands. The \"Smartville arc\" brought gold to California. Toward the end of the middle Jurassic – in the high noon of the dinosaurs, about a hundred and sixty-five million years ago – an island arc like the Aleutians or Japan had moved in from the western ocean and docked here. This was the third terrane at this latitude: the one that followed Sonomia and smashed into it with crumpling, mountain-building effects that propogated eastward turning soils into phyllites, sandstones into quartzites, siltstones into slates – the metamorphics we had seen up the road. In aggregate, the three terranes extended the continent by at least four hundred miles. The third one, suturing here, had doubled the width of what is now California. … If the story of California sounds fantastic, with all its accreting arcs and melanges coming up from the western sea, just look at a map of the southwest Pacific – look at the relationship between Australia and Indonesia right now. [Hot spots] Great Meteor and Cape Verde seem to have lifted New England's high mountains, Bermuda the Smokies. Uplift accelerates erosion. The rock of the Permian period – the last chapter in the Appalachian mountain building story – has been removed everywhere in eastern America except in West Virginia and nearby parts of Ohio and Pennsylvania, halfway between the hot-spot tracks, halfway between New Hampshire and North Carolina. An ophiolite is a section of the Earth's oceanic crust and the underlying upper mantle that has been uplifted and exposed above sea level and often emplaced onto continental crustal rocks. The presence of ophiolites – which we see in California, among other places – is a consequence of continental collisions with oceanic plates. One geologist likened the ophiolite to a cow on a cowcatcher in front of an old western train. The earth as a whole is producing progressively less heat from radioactive decay, and that, at some point, is going to have a profound effect. In the future, the profound effect is going to be that the plates will stop moving. The plate tectonics revolution isn't the only recent revolution in geology. The ability to identify the age of rocks is significantly more advanced than it was in the day when the presence of fossils were the main yardstick. Iron minerals line up like compasses, pointing toward the changing magnetic poles. Isotope decay rates are known and constant. Rock types can be identified by their magnetic signatures. The magnetic field is sampling the shallow crust, the upper few thousand feet. The gravity field is averaging, basically, the whole lithosphere. When you look at a gravity map you are seeing deeper features of the crust. One problem with writing about science is that as any book is written, it immediately is threatened with obsolescence. McPhee observed, The thought occurs to me, not for the first time, that I am following a science as it lurches forward from error to discovery and back to error. But this is actually as much an asset of the writing as it is a detraction. I expect this volume will be worth reading even a hundred years from now because it is not just a textbook. It's written in the form of journeys, set pieces, flashbacks, biographical sketches, and histories of the human and lithic kind . And at the same time, it offers discovery and insight."

For the average joe to pick this up and read through it would be a battle - especially if the subject doesn't interest him. But as Dennis Hopper said to Chris Walken in True Romance \"this shit fascinates me.\" Different subject matter - same principle. I've always liked rocks and the thought of what went on before we got here - why things are the way they are - and what is going to continue long after we are gone has a certain appeal. There's a certain comfort that comes in reading about something that doesn't give a shit about the Dow Jones, ISIS, Obama, American Idol and the Superbowl. It's a planet doing it's thing and there's nothing you can do to stop it. It's not a predictive science. The geologic history in this book is interwoven with man's history in this country as it relates to the areas across a specific latitude of the US. Though there is a lot of rocks to wade through I really enjoyed the book. I probably didn't absorb much of the various delineations of geologic time aside from Precambrian and everything that came after - but in context to how long people have been around - it really puts things in perspective. The the history of earth were the length of \"Stairway to Heaven\" we would be part of of one of the syllables of Plant's last utterance of the word Heaven as the song ends - maybe not even that much. There were some very eye opening things that I never knew about as well as far as how North America came together. I was always under the impression that we just sort of floated away from Pangeia or the first continent and that was it - apparently not. The chapter on California was really interesting as well regarding faults and earthquakes, the gold rush, etc. It was just a really cool book if you like earth sciences. If you don't? stick with a novel because this will be some work for you."

I really enjoyed the science and the storytelling, but the book often spent too much time using words it hadn't defined and too little time telling stories about processes. My favorite parts were the vignettes connecting geology to history - the gold miners in the Sierra Nevadas, the cowboys in Wyoming, even the vacationers in the Delaware Water Gap. (I was disappointed that this vignette was missing from the final \"book,\" Crossing the Craton .) Each book also introduced a new geological phenomenon, which were the parts I suspect I'll remember best. Other parts were tougher to finish. I often struggled to follow the long passages describing how specific geographical places came to be - describing rocks being shoved up, eroding, being covered, flipping, and deformed by other rocks. I get that this is how geology works, but it doesn't always translate to the written page. Also, as I said in my review for \"Assembling California,\" I'd love to see more pictures and maps. However, for all my complaints, I am now a geology fan and have a much deeper appreciation for the earth around me. I'd guess that's what John McPhee would have wanted me to get out of it."

John McPhee began to wonder about these roadcuts and over several years compiled a geologic history of the United States through interviews and feild trips with geology professors from New York to San Francisco. His epic adventure immerses readers in deep deep time, a complex poetry of terminology, and a fascinating array of personal stories. He continually reconnects the geology of the narrative to the reader through frequent references to history and periodic sprinklings of wry humor. And it's not all geology; You'll be amazed by Geologist David Love's family history and thrilled and appalled at the rapid-fire recounts of experiences of the Loma Prieta earthquake of 1988, when slabs of double-decker highway dropped onto commuter vehicles and Candlestick Park shook duriing the world Series. This is not a strictly layman's book. The language is dense, the concepts unfamiliar, and the few illustrations, diagrams and maps insufficient to clarify much of the text. However, McPhee possesses the sensibilities of both journalist and poet. While the reader may have to soldier through ignornance and inexperience at times, the 660 page journey creates a satisfying understanding of the precepts and questions posed by geologists and geology and a grounding sense of the theory of geological time and the formation of the surface of our planet. Overall, it makes me feel small and ephemeral."

    "desc":"Comprised of a series of interrelated scenes, the play traces the coming of age of Heidi Holland, a successful art historian, as she tries to find her bearings in a rapidly changing world. Gradually distancing herself from her friends, she watches them move from the idealism and political radicalism of their college years through militant feminism and, eventually, back to the materialism that they had sought to reject in the first place. Heidi's own path to maturity involves an affair with the glib, arrogant Scoop Rosenbaum, a womanizing lawyer\/publisher who eventually marries for money and position; a deeper but even more troubling relationship with a charming, witty young pediatrician, Peter Patrone, who turns out to be gay; and increasingly disturbing contacts with the other women, now much changed, who were a part of her childhood and college years. Eventually Heidi comes to accept the fact that liberation can be achieved only if one is true to oneself, with goals that come out of need rather than circumstance. As the play ends she is still \"alone,\" but having adopted an orphaned baby, it is clear that she has begun to find a sense of fulfillment and continuity that may well continue to elude the others of her anxious, self-centered generation.",

        "text":"One of my reading themes in 2016, that I hope to continue in 2017, has been to read more classic plays. It is in this regard that I selected Wendy Wasserstein's The Heidi Chronicles, which won the Pulitzer Prize for drama in 1988. Wasserstein had previously wrote for the Seattle Repertory Company and penned two other plays- An Uncommon Woman and A Life Imagined. Heidi was her first play to win multiple awards and enjoy long success on Broadway. The Heidi Chronicles details twenty five years in the life of Dr. Heidi Holland, professor of art history. Heidi becomes an archetype of the baby boom era who went from campaigning for Eugene McCarthy to demanding equality for women in the work place and at home. Along the way, we meet other characters who share Heidi's journey in life: Susan who is Heidi's closest friend and cracks the glass ceiling in the working world; Scoop Rosenbaum an entrepreneur who loves Heidi but can not marry her because she would rather achieve at work than at home; and Peter Patrone, Heidi's first love who becomes a successful pediatrician and then turns out to be gay. These four characters become representative of the baby boom era that is still achieving today. In the course of 80 pages of dialogue, it is clear that Wasserstein diligently took the time to research Heidi's character. We learn of lesser known female painters who had to take a back seat to famous men in society; most evident is Lilly Cabot who at a time lived next door to Monet and learned from the French master. What Heidi hoped to achieve in the art world was to eradicate the gap between men and women so that Lilly Cabot is as well known as Claude Monet. This is apparent with Wasserstein's other characters as well. Susan makes inroads in producing sitcoms, Lisa publishes children's books, and April hosts Hello, New York. All of these gains occurred in the 1980s while the glass ceiling was first beginning to crack. What did not work for me and lowered my rating was the depiction of the male characters in the play. In order to get Heidi to achieve, Wasserstein created two ex-lovers who maintained traits negative enough for Heidi to reject them. Scoop Rosenbaum desired a spouse who would not compete with him. Lisa Friedlander desired a family and was happy taking a back seat to her husband, so she was marriageable material; Heidi, who loved Scoop dearly but wanted a successful career, was not. Peter also loved Heidi for a quarter century but turns out to be gay. In the 21st century, Scoop and Heidi would be considered a power couple. In the mid 1980s, however, Heidi impedes Scoop rise to stardom, thus dating the play thirty years back. The Heidi Chronicles remains a poignant study of the feminist side to the baby boom generation. I enjoyed reading how women of my mother's generation began to crack into the mythical glass ceiling in many facets of the working world. Yet, from its depiction of men, I believe the play not to be as timeless as some of the other plays I have read this year. Heidi was deserving of the Pulitzer upon its release in 1988, and I glad that I took the time to study it. Worthy of this award, I rate The Heidi Chronicles 4 stars."

        "text":"The Heidi Chronicles is a coming of age novel that leaves the reader feeling empty, disappointed and more than a little depressed. The main character comes of age during a time of change and movement from the time spanning the 1960's-to the early 90's. With all of this change surrounding her Heidi feels compelled to action and finds herself fiercely advocating for the representation of women in art. However through all of this she finds herself lonely and unfulfilled. Her romantic life center mainly around two men, Peter Patron and Scoop Rosenbaum, however each one has a surprise for her. Besides the fact that I hated the main character the story itself was pretty good I guess. GUESS being the operative word. The play is a disjointed mess, that lacked the fluidity which most readers (or viewers) need in order to keep up with the story. The so called \"witty banter\" reeked of forced artsyness and I felt an extreme disappointment that this play had won awards and was considered great American writing. But maybe the play actually would be good for somebody who was 16 in 1965 and could understand all the references. OH THE REFERENCES!!! Without a proper understanding of these references it's impossible to garner any sort of appreciation for the book and that in itself is a problem. It doesn't have the timelessness of a true play (cough cough...SHAKESPEARE...cough cough OSCAR WILDE). And therefore god willing it will slip quietly into oblivion within the next decade or so."

        "text":"I'm not big on plays, but I really liked this one. The thing that attracted me initially was the synopsis - finding myself and trying to be true to myself (as cliche as it sounds) are things I have always thought about. But I definitely found much more in this play. People argue if this work is still relevant, they talk about feminism and how it's different today. I do agree that this work is about the specific situation of a middle-class woman in that specific time and I wouldn't say that one can just change some details and, voila, the play would be as if set today. (The dialogue alone both between Heidi and Scoop or Peter and Heidi and Fran or Susan would go quite differently today.) But, although significant improvements on women's rights have been made, I would say the question of \"having it all\" is still very much on the table (or the question of having equal opportunities if we're talking in terms of class). We as people are still trying to find ourselves, wanting to find our own voices, but also wanting to be a part of a larger group, to find acceptance, but also be content with ourselves. But it's not only about being relevant, it does and has more than that. The play serves as a historical view on feminism and its problems back then, it is a play where the sentiment that was present in the lives of many women was finally put on paper and then the stage. And it has such snappy and witty dialogues that to me they seemed as good and important as the subject matter itself. I'm not going to go into an analysis of the text itself as there are definitely more competent people out there doing just that, but there is one more thing I would like to say about the matter at hand and things around it. The women in this play fight for having it all, but the content of \"having it all\" is not the same for every woman (or every man, for that matter). The play seems to be more about the women being in this together (or, as it turns out, not being together), but it seems to me it also brings up a question of separateness in this togetherness. That is still a question worth considering. And this is still a play worth reading."

I was a teen in the 80s, so I have heard about this play and Wendy Wasserstein since the play came out, but I never saw the play or really knew anything more than that it was an overview of one woman’s life and that it had a feminist message. I found the play much more confusing than I expected. There was a lot of weird banter, and I think the political references are getting so out of date they are hard to relate to, but the feeling of being a baby boomer white woman coming of age in the latter part of the 20th century and realizing that you were sold a bill of goods is still relatable. Heidi is a particular kind of person—from a privileged background, idealistic, independent. I kept picturing Meg Ryan in When Harry Met Sally. I would’ve loved to discuss this play in a class or with a book group because so much could be said about it. I’m glad I read it. I hope I get to see it performed sometime but someone should try to do a new version. The baby boomers are fading now. I mean I’m gen-X and even *I* am getting old so where is the feminist play of this new generation? If someone knows a new playwright who has written something similar that I should read, please leave a comment. I am just scratching the surface of dramatic reading, and came to it haphazardly so I could use some direction. I mean it’s not like the questions have changed all that much for women—I’d love to be able to compare. Anyway, this play made me think a whole lot about stuff other than the play itself and that is a weird reading experience."

Follows the life of Heidi over the course of her womanhood, starting in the 60’s when she and the rest of her college-aged gal pals are listening to the Beatles, taking birth control, and burning their bras to the 80’s where she is a successful art historian and professor at Columbia who pursued her career first and foremost over starting a family, prompting insecurity about the things she gave up in order to achieve what she got. This is perfectly juxtaposed by the love of her life Scoop, whom she didn’t marry because of her career. He marries a girl for money, starts a family, and continually seeks happiness through affairs. Also, there’s Heidi’s gay best friend Peter, whom she continually puts on the back burner who is a gay successful pediatrician living in NYC in the midst of the AIDS crisis. When it’s all said and done, the point is, if you are the one making the decision for your life, it is a life well-lived. You make your own rules and boomers, who we all make fun of daily, led the charge for gender and sexual liberation."

Heidi even compares herself to a Heffalump and gurrrrllll. Same. Heidi's heartbreaking speech in Act 2, Scene 4 is the perfect distillation of what Wasserstein's aiming to bring to the surface: wasn't the feminist movement supposed to bring women together? If so, why does Heidi feel so alone?"

I was a teen in the 80s, so I have heard about this play and Wendy Wasserstein since the play came out, but I never saw the play or really knew anything more than that it was an overview of one woman’s life and that it had a feminist message. I found the play much more confusing than I expected. There was a lot of weird banter, and I think the political references are getting so out of date they are hard to relate to, but the feeling of being a baby boomer white woman coming of age in the latter part of the 20th century and realizing that you were sold a bill of goods is still relatable. Heidi is a particular kind of person—from a privileged background, idealistic, independent. I kept picturing Meg Ryan in When Harry Met Sally. I would’ve loved to discuss this play in a class or with a book group because so much could be said about it. I’m glad I read it. I hope I get to see it performed sometime but someone should try to do a new version. The baby boomers are fading now. I mean I’m gen-X and even *I* am getting old so where is the feminist play of this new generation? If someone knows a new playwright who has written something similar that I should read, please leave a comment. I am just scratching the surface of dramatic reading, and came to it haphazardly so I could use some direction. I mean it’s not like the questions have changed all that much for women—I’d love to be able to compare. Anyway, this play made me think a whole lot about stuff other than the play itself and that is a weird reading experience."

Follows the life of Heidi over the course of her womanhood, starting in the 60’s when she and the rest of her college-aged gal pals are listening to the Beatles, taking birth control, and burning their bras to the 80’s where she is a successful art historian and professor at Columbia who pursued her career first and foremost over starting a family, prompting insecurity about the things she gave up in order to achieve what she got. This is perfectly juxtaposed by the love of her life Scoop, whom she didn’t marry because of her career. He marries a girl for money, starts a family, and continually seeks happiness through affairs. Also, there’s Heidi’s gay best friend Peter, whom she continually puts on the back burner who is a gay successful pediatrician living in NYC in the midst of the AIDS crisis. When it’s all said and done, the point is, if you are the one making the decision for your life, it is a life well-lived. You make your own rules and boomers, who we all make fun of daily, led the charge for gender and sexual liberation."

I think I expected a more confident, self-assured Heidi when I began but what Wendy Wasserstein gave us was a more complex, ambivalent portrait. Heidi even compares herself to a Heffalump and gurrrrllll. Same. Heidi's heartbreaking speech in Act 2, Scene 4 is the perfect distillation of what Wasserstein's aiming to bring to the surface: wasn't the feminist movement supposed to bring women together? If so, why does Heidi feel so alone?"

        "text":"One of my reading themes in 2016, that I hope to continue in 2017, has been to read more classic plays. It is in this regard that I selected Wendy Wasserstein's The Heidi Chronicles, which won the Pulitzer Prize for drama in 1988. Wasserstein had previously wrote for the Seattle Repertory Company and penned two other plays- An Uncommon Woman and A Life Imagined. Heidi was her first play to win multiple awards and enjoy long success on Broadway. The Heidi Chronicles details twenty five years in the life of Dr. Heidi Holland, professor of art history. Heidi becomes an archetype of the baby boom era who went from campaigning for Eugene McCarthy to demanding equality for women in the work place and at home. Along the way, we meet other characters who share Heidi's journey in life: Susan who is Heidi's closest friend and cracks the glass ceiling in the working world; Scoop Rosenbaum an entrepreneur who loves Heidi but can not marry her because she would rather achieve at work than at home; and Peter Patrone, Heidi's first love who becomes a successful pediatrician and then turns out to be gay. These four characters become representative of the baby boom era that is still achieving today. In the course of 80 pages of dialogue, it is clear that Wasserstein diligently took the time to research Heidi's character. We learn of lesser known female painters who had to take a back seat to famous men in society; most evident is Lilly Cabot who at a time lived next door to Monet and learned from the French master. What Heidi hoped to achieve in the art world was to eradicate the gap between men and women so that Lilly Cabot is as well known as Claude Monet. This is apparent with Wasserstein's other characters as well. Susan makes inroads in producing sitcoms, Lisa publishes children's books, and April hosts Hello, New York. All of these gains occurred in the 1980s while the glass ceiling was first beginning to crack. What did not work for me and lowered my rating was the depiction of the male characters in the play. In order to get Heidi to achieve, Wasserstein created two ex-lovers who maintained traits negative enough for Heidi to reject them. Scoop Rosenbaum desired a spouse who would not compete with him. Lisa Friedlander desired a family and was happy taking a back seat to her husband, so she was marriageable material; Heidi, who loved Scoop dearly but wanted a successful career, was not. Peter also loved Heidi for a quarter century but turns out to be gay. In the 21st century, Scoop and Heidi would be considered a power couple. In the mid 1980s, however, Heidi impedes Scoop rise to stardom, thus dating the play thirty years back. The Heidi Chronicles remains a poignant study of the feminist side to the baby boom generation. I enjoyed reading how women of my mother's generation began to crack into the mythical glass ceiling in many facets of the working world. Yet, from its depiction of men, I believe the play not to be as timeless as some of the other plays I have read this year. Heidi was deserving of the Pulitzer upon its release in 1988, and I glad that I took the time to study it. Worthy of this award, I rate The Heidi Chronicles 4 stars."

        "text":"This was the second play I’ve read this month. I was a teen in the 80s, so I have heard about this play and Wendy Wasserstein since the play came out, but I never saw the play or really knew anything more than that it was an overview of one woman’s life and that it had a feminist message. I found the play much more confusing than I expected. There was a lot of weird banter, and I think the political references are getting so out of date they are hard to relate to, but the feeling of being a baby boomer white woman coming of age in the latter part of the 20th century and realizing that you were sold a bill of goods is still relatable. Heidi is a particular kind of person—from a privileged background, idealistic, independent. I kept picturing Meg Ryan in When Harry Met Sally. I would’ve loved to discuss this play in a class or with a book group because so much could be said about it. I’m glad I read it. I hope I get to see it performed sometime but someone should try to do a new version. The baby boomers are fading now. I mean I’m gen-X and even *I* am getting old so where is the feminist play of this new generation? If someone knows a new playwright who has written something similar that I should read, please leave a comment. I am just scratching the surface of dramatic reading, and came to it haphazardly so I could use some direction. I mean it’s not like the questions have changed all that much for women—I’d love to be able to compare. Anyway, this play made me think a whole lot about stuff other than the play itself and that is a weird reading experience."

Follows the life of Heidi over the course of her womanhood, starting in the 60’s when she and the rest of her college-aged gal pals are listening to the Beatles, taking birth control, and burning their bras to the 80’s where she is a successful art historian and professor at Columbia who pursued her career first and foremost over starting a family, prompting insecurity about the things she gave up in order to achieve what she got. This is perfectly juxtaposed by the love of her life Scoop, whom she didn’t marry because of her career. He marries a girl for money, starts a family, and continually seeks happiness through affairs. Also, there’s Heidi’s gay best friend Peter, whom she continually puts on the back burner who is a gay successful pediatrician living in NYC in the midst of the AIDS crisis. When it’s all said and done, the point is, if you are the one making the decision for your life, it is a life well-lived. You make your own rules and boomers, who we all make fun of daily, led the charge for gender and sexual liberation."

I think I expected a more confident, self-assured Heidi when I began but what Wendy Wasserstein gave us was a more complex, ambivalent portrait. Heidi even compares herself to a Heffalump and gurrrrllll. Same. Heidi's heartbreaking speech in Act 2, Scene 4 is the perfect distillation of what Wasserstein's aiming to bring to the surface: wasn't the feminist movement supposed to bring women together? If so, why does Heidi feel so alone?"

But the language is so spot on and the banter is so real...I trust that, when seen and heard, all would be revealed.

    "desc":"Here is the novel that will be forever considered Frank Herbert's triumph of the imagination. Set on the desert planet Arrakis, Dune is the story of the boy Paul Atreides, heir to a noble family tasked with ruling an inhospitable world where the only thing of value is the “spice” melange, a drug capable of extending life and enhancing consciousness. Coveted across the known universe, melange is a prize worth killing for.... When House Atreides is betrayed, the destruction of Paul’s family will set the boy on a journey toward a destiny greater than he could ever have imagined. And as he evolves into the mysterious man known as Muad’Dib, he will bring to fruition humankind’s most ancient and unattainable dream. A stunning blend of adventure and mysticism, environmentalism and politics, Dune won the first Nebula Award, shared the Hugo Award, and formed the basis of what is undoubtedly the grandest epic in science fiction.",

        "text":"In my head, the purpose of this review is very clear. It is to convince YOU to read this book. Yes, you! Waste time no more. Go grab a copy. Machiavellian intrigue, mythology, religion, politics, imperialism, environmentalism, the nature of power. All this set in a mind-boggling, frighteningly original world which Herbert ominously terms as an \"effort at prediction\". Dune had me hooked! First impression The very first stirring I felt upon opening the yellowed pages of Dune was that of stumbling upon an English translation of an ancient Arabic manuscript of undeniable power and potence which had an epic story to narrate. The tone was umistakably sombre and I realized Herbert was not here to merely entertain me, he was here to make me part of the legend of Muad'Dib . It was intriguing and challenging and heck, since I live for challenges I decided to take this one up too, gladly. The challenge was the complexity and depth of the plot, which left me perplexed, in the beginning. I knew there were dialogues which meant much more than their superficial meaning and was unable to grasp at it. I felt a yawning chasm between Herbert's vision and my limited understanding of it. However, of course, I plodded on and could feel the gap closing in with every page much to my joy and relief. The Foreword \"To the people whose labours go beyond ideas into the realm of 'real materials'- to the dry-land ecologists, wherever they may be, in whatever time they work, this effort at prediction is dedicated in humility and admiration.\" The foreword makes it pretty clear that Frank Herbert isn't kidding around. This is a serious effort at predicting how our world is going to look two thousand years from now and by God, it's a bloody good and detailed prediction. However, the real merit in this effort lies in the commentary on our lives in the present. Why Frank Herbert is a genius The setting of the book is arid futuristic. the plot is driven by political mind games reminiscent of The Game of Thrones. The issues he tackles are as modern as the colour television. Herbert's genius manifests itself in his ability to combine the past, the present and the future in one sweeping elegant move called Dune. Plot and Setting Dune is set in a futuristic technologically advanced world which after the Butlerian Jihad (the bloody war between Man and Machines) has eliminated all computers and passed a decree declaring \"Thou shalt not make a machine in the likeness of a man's mind\" . Since there are no computers, the essential working of the galaxy is still medieval and feudal with heavy reliance on men and their dallying around. Lots of thriller potential right there. Men with superhuman analytical abilities called Mentats have taken the place of Computers. On the other hand, we have the Bene Gesserit , an ancient school of mental and physical training for female students (it gives them superhuman intuitive powers) who follow a selective breeding program which makes them feared and mistrusted through the Imperium. Their desired end product of this breeding program is the Kwisatz Haderach , a superman who’ll be able to glimpse into the future. How he’ll be able to do this is rooted in Herbert’s idea of determinism: given that one can observe everything and analyze everything, one can effectively glimpse the future in probabilistic terms. Quantum physics anyone? The Kwisatz Haderach is the proposed solution to the male-female dichotomy, between the analytical and intuitive. The plot of Dune is almost wholly set on the desert planet of Arrakis (also referred to as Dune), an arid wasteland where water is so scarce that men have to wear stillsuits which recycle human moisture for further consumption. The source of the galaxy’s interest in the planet is Melange , a spice which bestows upon one longevity and prescient powers. Everything on the planet is permeated with the spice, the air, the sand, the food. Everybody on the planet is hopelessly addicted to the spice, their only hope for survival being their continued intake of the spice. The Spacing Guild , the economic and trading monopolistic arm of the Galaxy badly needs the spice for interstellar transport. This is because their frigates travel faster than the speed of light and hence travel backward in time. The spice is the only way they can look into the future and see their way ahead. How cool is that! All the powers on the Galaxy are out to mine the spice, braving the sandworms, their name merely an euphemism, for they are gigantic 200 metre long creatures which always come digging through the sand whenever spice mining is undertook. Always . There’s also another little glitch. There exist on the planet, the kickass native desert tribal Fremen , whom the foreign powers look down with suspicion and disdain. The Fremen ethos is one of survival and scarcity, driven by tribalism and egalitarianism. Okay, I’ll stop right there. No more spoilers about this. Except that they value water to the extent that spitting on a person is the highest honour they can bestow upon him. Our protagonists are the Atreides family, consisting of the Duke, his Bene Gesserit concubine Jessica and their son Paul, who have been entrusted the stewardship of Arrakis. We discover the alien planet of Arrakis along with them, firstly with fear, suspicion and wonder and ultimately, love and respect. Paul Muad’Dib , however is no ordinary prince. There’s a teeny weeny chance he might be the Kwisatz Haderach , something which troubles him constantly and gives us our conflicted hero. The poor chap trips balls over the spice and has visions of black hordes pillaging and murdering around town bearing his flag and sees his dead body multiple times. My favourite character, however has to be the Baron Vladmir Harkonnen , the most evil character I’ve ever come across in my literary excursions. He is ruddy ruthlessness, he is virile villainy, he is truculent treachery. He executes the inept chess players in his employ which says oodles about his badassery and his fondness for cold-blooded logic. He sees everything in simplistic chess terms. What is my best move? What is my opponent’s best move? Is there anything I can do to completely squash his move? Is there a tactic which leads to mate in three? Themes In this setting, Herbert does so much, it’s unbelievable. Religion, politics, the dynamic nature of power, the effects of colonialism, our blatant destruction of our environment are themes which run parallel to the intensely exciting and labyrinthine plot. He shows the paramount importance of myth making and religion for power to sustain over long periods of time. Man, as a political animal is laid completely bare. Real life Now these are my thoughts about what Herbert could have meant to be Arrakis- It makes perfect sense. Herbert draws heavy inspiration for the religious ideology of Muad’Dib from Islam. He says “When religion and politics ride in the same cart and that cart is driven by a living Holy man, nothing can stand in the path of such a people.” which is the philosphy of the politics of Islam. Islamism in a nutshell. The spice, much desired by everyone, is the oil. Baron Vladmir Harkonnen is symblomatic of the wily Russians. The Desert foxes Fremen are representative of the native Saudi desert-dwelling Bedouin tribe who have a strongly tribe-oriented culture and undoubtedly value water in equal measure. And the ultimate loser is the environment. Why do good books get over? I almost forget this is a science fiction novel, it’s that real. It is also scary and prophetic. It is a reading experience that will leave you dreaming of the grave emptiness of Arrakis and make you wish you were there to brave it all in the privileged company of the noble Fremen. Frank Herbert achieves the pinnacle of what a sci-fi author aspires to rise to; authentic world building."

        "text":"Omg! I found a Folio Society Edition a bit cheaper and brand new! You can see all of the art online but look at this cover! Now I have this and Little Women I actually got from their site. I need to get more as I can 😬 ✅Reread 2022 to try to complete series! (I need to get the awesome audio too) 4.5 Stars LOOK DAMN IT! OMG! Mel 🖤🐶🐺🐾 •••••••••••••••• I was so worried that I wouldn't understand a thing in this book. I will admit there are some things that went over my head but for the most part I figured it out. I remember a billion and 65 years ago I watched the movie and was like what the? Basically all I remember is Sting and sandworms. I would love to watch it again and see if I understand it more after reading the book. I'm still not sure what all the spices were about on Arrakis. I keep thinking it's like their farming like we would farm corn or tobacco, etc. I could be wrong and I didn't get the connection between the spice and the sandworms. Is it like a drug to them? I did read in the back of the book that is was like a drug when taken in small quantities and really addictive when taken in large quantities and that Muad'Did felt his prophesies were because of the spice. I liked Duke Leto and I hated that he was betrayed not long after they got to Arrakis. There is always some twat out there causing trouble. I really enjoyed Paul's character and his mother Jessica. They seemed like really strong people and adapted very well in everything they were put through. I didn't really pay too much attention to the other characters or I guess I should say I didn't have many thoughts about them. With the exception of the ones that betrayed them. I really enjoyed when Paul and Jessica had to travel to get away from the evil Baron Harkonnen before they were killed too. I don't know why, but I enjoyed their little journey. I think they were both great in their roles when they were found by the Freman and showed they were a force to be reckoned with. Now maybe I'm getting this all wrong but I'm trying to tell it through the way I saw it in my mind. I don't understand how Paul's sister, Alia, was an abomination. That one must have went over my head too. It might have had something to do with the poison Jessica took to become the Reverend Mother. I'm not sure but I know some of my goodreads friends that read this will get me sorted out =) Other than the sandworms and traitorous people on Arrakis, I was most freaked out by the thought of the water issue! I would NOT was to live somewhere there was a water shortage. And the part where they were talking about selling foot water, I can't even. Which basically means your stinky foot sweat! Anyhoo, I really loved the book! Mel 🖤🐶🐺🐾 ✅Thank you for the answers in my comments! 😊 MY BLOG: Melissa Martin's Reading List"

        "text":"Dune. No other single syllable means as much to the science fiction genre, a single word that conjures images of sandworms, spice wars, great battles between rival dynastic families and a massively detailed and intricately crafted universe. No wonder this is widely regarded as not just a Science Fiction masterpiece, but a literary achievement as well. Like a study of Shakespeare, the reader finds that this is an archetype upon which many influences and imitators have based their works. The complexity and depth of the creation is staggering and I am continually astounded at the discipline with which Herbert must have focused his imagination. This is the book upon which Herbert would base his greatest series and one that would outlive him as his son has continued to expand and add detail to the vast, immaculate tapestry woven by a true master of the genre. Encapsulating political, economic, sociological, biological, cultural and dynastic themes, Frank Herbert has set a high standard for later practitioners. Brilliant. ***2015 reread - Read years later, this has lost none of its narrative power, if anything I can better appreciate the virtuoso attention to detail Herbert exhibited in his epic creation. From the perspective of having read his later 5 Dune sequels, I am astounded at the rich tapestry he has woven. Most impressive was his close omnipresence, analyzing the thoughts and minute actions and subtle nuances of his complicated dynamic interplay of characters. The exhaustive training of the Bene Gesserit and the intricate relations of the Houses and the Guild would stand as a monumental benchmark for speculative fiction ever since. This time around I found myself looking more closely at the Harkonnens and will likely read some of Brian Herbert's additions to his fathers great work. ***2019 reread - I'm even more in love with this book and am again in awe of Herbert's narrative skill. This time around I noticed that all of the quotes that begin chapters are from Princess Irulan and I paid close attention to how Herbert crafted these interludes. I also was drawn to the religious undertones that really began very early in the book and how Paul realized his gifts and was preparing for his role in the beginning chapters - all demonstrating Herbert's great narrative skill. Finally, I became more aware of what a great character was Gurney Halleck. While the ghola of Duncan Idaho dominated the later books, Herbert's creation of Halleck was an enjoyable and thought provoking addition to this masterpiece. *** 2025 reread - This has lost nothing over the years and if nothing else, is even more potent now. I love that a new generation of fans, inspired by a very good adaptation are discovering Herbert's greatest work and for good reason, this is not only great science fiction, but good literature. Frank Herbert's prose is gifted and I am again amazed at the intricacy of his world building. There is foreshadowing within foreshadowing and his vision is something to behold."

        "text":"Let me start by first apologizing to everyone who loves this classic. I don't doubt Dune was something special when it first came out in the 1960s. But reading it for the first time today, it feels horribly outdated to me and at times almost incomprehensible. I was warned going into this story that the beginning is extremely hard to understand, but that is an understatement. I could barely follow its scene after scene of dialogue referencing people and places and events, all with no explanation or context. It literally feels like I was just dropped into the middle of a book, and everything had already been explained elsewhere. But it gets better, right? Well, only somewhat. A narrative does take shape, but the writing style remains confusing and obscure. It manages to be both long-winded and not clear enough, if you can believe that. Certain obvious points are harped on again and again, but other crucial ones are merely glossed over. Then, when you inevitably miss those important points, they create this cascading effect that keeps you mired in confusion. The writing is also pretentious, with regular or nonsensical things consistently being presented in a profound way. There are plenty of extraneous paragraphs that sound good until you try to discern their meaning, at which point you'd be stumped. This sort of writing really confused me because I couldn't figure out which paragraphs mattered and needed to be dissected carefully to suss out their hidden meaning, and which ones are just adornment. As for the story itself, it was a complete mismatch with my interests. I like science fiction with lots of real science. Instead, this is a space opera (a.k.a. a soap opera that takes place in space) with no actual science. It's all political intrigue, melodrama, doublespeak, and who has power over who, which I have zero interest in. I also couldn't care less about how fawningly amazing Paul is and how he is destined to be the chosen one. This was such a frustrating reading experience because it could've been an amazing story. And there were moments in the beginning when I thought it was going in those creative directions. I was riveted during that infamous test in the first scene, only to realize that it was completely irrelevant to the rest of the story. Or to see where the book could take the scientific aspects of a desert planet and a population with so little water, which it didn't other than a bit of lip service. But the book stubbornly chose to disregard these more interesting avenues, and instead took the most straightforward, boring route of making this into a story about power struggle. Well, we could've saved ourselves the bother and just stayed on Earth for that. ~~~~~~~~~~~~ ✧ Connect with me ✧ Instagram ✧"

        "text":"There's a characteristically witty essay by Borges about a man who rewrites Don Quixote , many centuries after Cervantes. He publishes a novel with the same title, containing the same words in the same order. But, as Borges shows you, the different cultural context means it's a completely new book! What was once trite and commonplace is now daring and new, and vice versa. It just happens to look like Cervantes's masterpiece. Similarly, imagine the man who was brave or stupid enough to rewrite Dune in the early 21st century. Like many people who grew up in the 60s and 70s, I read the book in my early teens. What an amazing story! Those kick-ass Fremen! All those cool, weird-sounding names and expressions they use! (They even have a useful glossary in the back). The disgusting, corrupt, slimy Harkonnens - don't you just love to hate them! When former-aristo-turned-desert-guerilla-fighter Paul Muad'Dib rides in on a sandworm at the end to fight the evil Baron and his vicious, cruel nephew, of course you're cheering for him. Who the hell wouldn't be? So that was the Dune we know and love, but the man who rewrote it now would get a rather different reception. Oh my God! These Fremen, who obviously speak Arabic , live on a desert planet which supplies the Universe with melange, a commodity essential to the Galactic economy, and in particular to transport. Not a very subtle way to say \"oil\"! They are tough, uncompromising fighters, who are quite happy to use suicide bombing as a tactic. They're led by a charismatic former rich kid (OK, we get who you mean), who inspires them to rise up against the corrupt, degenerate... um, does he mean Westerners? Or only the US? And who is Baron Harkonnen intended to be? I'm racking my brains... Dubya doesn't quite seem to fit, but surely he means someone ? Unless, of course, he's just a generic stereotype who stands for the immoral, sexually obsessed West. This is frightening. What did we do to make Frank al-Herbert hate us so much? You'd have people, not even necessarily right-wingers, appearing on TV to say that the book was dangerous, and should be banned: at the very least, it incites racial hatred, and openly encourages terrorism. But translations would sell brilliantly in Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, and a bad movie version would soon be made in Turkey. I honestly don't think Herbert meant any of that; but today, it's almost impossible not to wonder. If anyone reading this review is planning to rewrite The Tale of Benjamin Bunny , you'd better make sure you get your timing right. Who knows how it will be interpreted five years from now?"

        "text":"No one should argue the importance Dune . It laid the foundations for a great deal of the themes and constructs in modern science fiction. Frank Herbert was as important to the genre as Isaac Asimov and Arthur Clarke. Unfortunately, just like them, he's quite dated, and his books can be a labor to read. One thing he maintained from old science fiction was prim and scientific dialogue that no one would ever actually speak. I've known many scientists, and they don't talk like this. You're not going to convince me a child does. The stuffy dialogue is inserted into even stuffier narrative, until it feels like nothing is organic about Herbert's prose. This is a terrible tragedy when you've got a world that he put so much effort into building - and it is an amazing feat of world-building, technically interplanetary building. But unlike J.R.R. Tolkien, who he is so frequently compared to, Herbert didn't make sure to include a great story in his world. Instead he included a story that frequently illustrated how clunky an artificial world can be, even if it's lovingly crafted. I struggled to attach or find interest in anyone, yet they're more archetypes than human beings, whose logic races past modern skepticism and whose dialogue is cloyingly artificial, the way people cared for the Hobbits, Dwarves and Rangers. In his world-building, Tolkien at least saved himself from being dated by antedating himself, and even with his illuminated prose, wrought more characteristics in just one protagonist than all of Dune 's cast. Even the political intrigue Herbert tries to fall back on was overdone in the Spy genre decades before he started this book. All fans of the \"Genre\" genres should appreciate Herbert's massive contributions, but they shouldn't pretend to enjoy the books if they don't, and they should be wary of certain pitfalls typical of science fiction that survived into his landmark work."

Even the plot couldn't save Dune, since it's spoiled at every juncture by 'Princess Irulan' and her epigraphs before each chapter. Did no-one tell her about spoiler alerts? From the very first pages, this book plunges you in at the deep-end with an absurd amount of overly complex world-building, which just makes the book laborious to work through.

Sure, it might be a bit too soon for her, but she DID insist because we'll be seeing Dune part 2 later this year. And she happens to know that I'm a rabid uberfan with no mercy or remorse. PLUS, I was able to read from my gorgeous new hardcover copy gifted to me by my best friend and that really does make all the difference, no? Update 9\/15\/21 Re-read. Number 14. I cannot get over how beautiful this book is. Still my favorite after all these years. It only gets better with every re-read. Update 8\/28\/17 Re-read. Number 13. :) I cry when Paul meets Gurney. I shiver when Jessica consoles Chani. I'm awestruck by the peaks and troughs of time, free-will, and the weakness in Paul even as he heroically strives against the evil that is about to be unleashed upon the universe. *sigh* Perfection. Easily the number one book I've ever read. :) I waver, sometimes, but right now, it is my absolute favorite. :) Original Review: This is a phenomenal classic of literature. It's not just science fiction. It transcends science fiction, as a fascinating discussion of free-will versus inevitability. Can the Jihad be denied? Can Paul ever really avoid his own death, despite seeing every time-line play out with him as the butt of every cosmic joke? Can even cruelty or mercy even remain comprehensible after such knowledge? Yes, I think this work outdoes Nietzsche. It certainly does a great job of making us care about the question. Is this all? Is this just a work that pays great justice to philosophy of action and inaction? Or is the novel merely a clever play at turning the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle into the physical embodiment of a man? It is that, of course. The Kwisatz Haderach can be many places at once, and he can be both alive and dead at the same time just like that certain cat. Is the novel a coming of age tale, first set as a mirror against his father Leto, only then to mirror the whole universe that had just turned against him? Yes, of course. He was, after all, both the product of all his upbringing and his genes, embodying the question of nature versus nurture. He was taught within many schools of martial arts and assassins, as well as training the mind in both the schools of the Mentats with their pure logic and that of the mystics, the Bene Gesserit, that allows complete control over the body down to the cellular level. And if this training wasn't enough, he was deeply schooled in politics, leadership, and the meaning of loyalty. The boy was raised right. Of course, that is nothing without ninety generations of genetic bloodline tampering from the Bene Gesserit, right? To become the fulcrum between cellular memory, tapping the minds and lives of all your genetic ancestors as well as tapping the ability to fold time and space, to become the eye of a storm of time. What a damn brilliant setup for one tiny character, no? His training links to the unlocking of his genes and to the life-extending and enveloping spice, Melange, to make him not merely aware of time in a theoretical sense, but eventually to be unable to discern what was in the past, the present, or the future. Here's a true Super-Man, well beyond Nietzsche. And don't believe for one second that this serious discussion about what would make a superior man makes for dull reading. No. We've got PLOT that's probably some of the most exciting and visceral in all of literature, driving us right into the web of intrigue, vengeance, treachery, and galactic politics. To quote the text, we've got \"Plans within Plans,\" and it hardly stops there. We know the House Atreides is falling into a trap laid by the Emperor and House Harkonnen, and yet free-will and pride prevents any chance to avoid it. The setup is brilliant and extremely political, giving us character sketches of some of the most brilliant and memorable characters of all time. Duke Leto, the Red Duke, the most honorable and beloved leader. Duncan Idaho, the emotional and intuitive hero. Gurney Halleck, archetypal loyalist and troubadour. Lady Jessica, the woman who ought to have had all honor in life, but was unjustly reviled and set aside for political necessity. (Chani being both her mirror and her eventual glory.) And of course, my favorite character of all time, Paul Muad'dib Atreides, the one that would prevent the greater evils he foresaw, and went to enormous lengths and sacrifice to achieve, but who eventually failed in his task because even a god cannot overcome destiny. (Or the will of so many minds set as one.) So damn brilliant. Frank Herbert spent five years writing this treasure, working and reworking it until he published it at age 25. None of his other works come close to this masterpiece, and there's little wonder. It was birthed, fully-formed, like Athena from Zeus's head, with enormous forethought and care. The worldbuilding was just as carefully formed, from the ecology of Arrakis and the life-cycles of the sandworms, to the history and the creation of the Fremen from their mild beginnings as Zensunni Wanderers, adherents to the Orange Catholic Bible, to their history of oppression so like those of those who are Jewish, to their settling and hardening of their bodies and souls in the wastes of Arrakis, also just like the Jewish who carved out a place for themselves in Israel. (Current politics aside, this was a very potent idea before 1965 when Herbert wrote this, and indeed, the core is still just as powerful when you turn it back to Muslims.) The Galactic culture is rich and detailed. The CHOAM economic consortium, with their monopoly on space travel and their need for the Spice to allow them to see a short period into the future to plot a safe course before folding space. The Empire is caught on a knife's edge between a single power and every other House who sit in the possibility of putting aside all their squabbles for the sole purpose of checking the Emperor, if they so desired. (And Duke Atreides was such a possible popular leader among all the Great Houses, which was the primary reason the Emperor wanted him dead.) And of course, we have our Villains. The Baron Harkonnen has always been a crowd pleaser. Brilliant in his own right, devious and able to corrupt anyone with just the right sorts of pressure, including a certain absolutely trustworthy doctor we might mention. \"The Tooth! The Tooth!\" -- You can't handle the Tooth! Feyd Rautha Harkonnen is especially interesting for the question of nature versus nurture. The Bene Gesserit had intended him to mate with Paul, who should have been Leto and Jessica's daughter, and that offspring should have been the cumulation of ninety years of a breeding experiment to recreate the Kwisatz Haderach which had come about almost by accident during the Butlerian Jihad in the deep past, to overthrow the AI overlords. He was practically Paul's genetic twin, or at least, his potential to be the \"One who can be many places at once\" was on par with Paul. But instead of fulfilling the kind of destiny that we get with Paul, we see him grow up under the auspices of his Uncle the Baron, becoming as cruel and devious as he was deadly. He was the argument of nurture in the conversation, of course, and having so very little of it eventually cost him his life. I often wonder about the directions that Dune could have taken, all those little paths in time and circumstance that could have been. What if Feyd had been brought to Arrakis earlier and overwhelmed with Spice the way that Paul had? Sure, he wouldn't have been able to convert the unconscious changes into conscious manipulation, but he might have had enough glimpses of the future, the way that the Fremen did, to have given him the edge he would have needed to kill Paul. And then there's a relatively minor character, Hasimir Fenring, the Emperor's personal assassin, who was nearly the Kwisatz Haderach, himself. Unable to breed true, he was still potent enough to be completely hidden to Paul's time-sight in the same way that Paul was hidden from the Spacing Guild's weaker time-sight. His training as a skilled killer was also superior to Paul. He was, by all the hints and tricks in the tale, Paul's perfect downfall. It always gives me shivers to think about, and it was only in a single instant of both recognition and pity from Paul that stayed Fenring from killing our hero. It was just a moment of whim. The setup was gorgeous. Paul's pity, had it been missing at his moment of greatest triumph over the Emperor, would have meant Paul's assured death. I still wonder, to this day, what stayed Frank Herbert's hand from killing his most wonderful darling. We knew the pressure of religion and politics was going to have its way upon all the oppressed peoples of Dune. The return of a monstrous religious Jihad was going to happen one way or another, sweeping across the galaxy and toppling the Empire, regardless of Paul's frantic plans and desires. Paul's own death would only mean a higher level of fanaticism, and Frank Herbert's warning against unreasoning devotion would have been made even clearer with Paul's death. Perhaps it was pity that stayed his hand. Who are we to say who lives and who dies? If you really think this review is overlong, then I apologize, but please understand that I could absolutely go on and on much longer than this. It is a symptom of my devotion to this most brilliant of all tales. And yes, it still holds up very, very well after twelve reads. I am quite shocked and amazed."

        "text":"Update 2 March 2024 I saw Dune 2 and the first one is nothing compared with it. Actually, most movies are nothing compared to Dune 2. Maybe Villeneuve is the real Kwisatz Haderach. Update! Just wanted to say how much I loved the movie. Go see it. It was probably good that there was a gap between the time I read this and the movie. Read 2015 Amazing! A masterpiece of SF with which I will probably compare all SF books that I’ll read in the future. It goes in my favorites shelf. This is my 3rd attempt to read Dune and I am really grateful that I did not succeed the first two times I tried as I was too young to understand all the subtleties. I would have probably enjoyed it as a very well written adventure novel but nothing more. That would have been a pity as Dune is so much more than a story about space travel and epic battles between good and evil. It presents complex philosophical ideas, explores ecological issues, cultural identity and differences. Also a major theme is represented by religion and religious leadership. The disturbing part about this book, taken in the current political context, is how easily the Fremen can be identified with an Arab nation. The spice can be seen as “oil” and the Harkonnens as evil westerners\/Russians that are exploiting the natural resources without thinking about the locals and the environment. I saw that others reviewers saw this as well."

        "text":"‘ Deep in the human unconscious is a pervasive need for a logical universe that makes sense. But the real universe is always one step beyond logic. ’ The sheer scope and magnitude of this 1965 sci-fi drama is staggering, populated with an extensive cast of characters and a rich universe full of well-rounded lore, intricate politics where every actions is revealed as ‘ plans within plans within plans, ’ and dynamic cultures all set on a collision course of plot that rightfully earned it a wide readership and canonization as a “Classic” work. I found it lived up to the hype and opened itself up more upon a reread, validating the fond memories I had of it from reading it first as a young teenager smitten with anything sci-fi. This book has zero chill and everything is to extreme and epic levels, including the size of worms. But come for the Bene Gesserits, best part. While there isn’t much to say that likely hasn’t already been said better, I still want to pause and reflect on some key elements in Dune . This is such a well-crafted book that addresses themes of power, religion, historical records as mythmaking and environmental concerns in a narrative about proxy wars and power struggles that speak just as loudly today as it did about 1960s foreign policy. If you are looking for a book of epic proportions, you can’t go wrong with Dune . The best part about this book, to me, is the way it is constantly expanding. There is great world-building and a rich lore that recalls my glee first exploring The Lord of the Rings , but what really excites me is the way Herbert reveals it all. The book starts so small—a visit to a cottage from an old woman that seems like such a small scale fairy tale on page one—and swiftly becomes gargantuan and never stops growing. It leaves you constantly feeling yourself shrink beside a universe always revealing itself as more complex than you had realized. I enjoy the way Herbert only gives you the minimum of what you need to understand and lets it all slowly unfold when necessary. ‘ They've a legend here, a prophecy, that a leader will come to them, child of a Bene Gesserit, to lead them to true freedom. It follows the familiar messiah pattern. ’ For newcomers, the basis of the book is that Paul has been quite literally bred to be a messiah and is engulfed in a difficult power struggle over a planet that essentially upholds the interplanetary economy through mining an addictive substance called “spice”. You might quickly find yourself thinking of spice as oil and the planet Arrakis as Middle East and Northern Africa (Tor put out a really great essay on the way Herbert engages with Muslim culture and traditions ), you know, since there was a whole Cold War going on at the time and giving the villain Baron Harkonnen a first name like Vladimir might make you wonder if this is all an elaborate metaphor. The Baron saying ‘ in politics, the tripod is the most unstable of all structures, ’ might make you think of the three branches of US government. You get the idea. There are also WWII holdovers present, such as the Sardaukar as an elite fighting force trained on Salusa Secundus to make sure you catch the S.S. reference. That’s all very much there, but this book is so much more than a simple sci fi rendition of the Cold War and Herbert definitely wants you to apply these themes to our larger political and religious global interactions. ‘ Fear is the mind-killer. ’ Another aspect I find fascinating in Dune is the depiction of Paul Atreides in the ‘chosen one’ trope. Paul has reservations, though not due to thinking he doesn’t deserve it (dude is royalty anyways, essentially) but because he fears what it will bring. Paul’s powers are enhanced through spice and he is able to perceive the future, and in almost every possible scenario he sees nothing but mass war in his name: ’ They were all caught up in the need of their race to renew its scattered inheritance, to cross and mingle and infuse their bloodlines in a great new pooling of genes. And the race knew only one sure way for this—the ancient way, the tried and certain way that rolled over everything in its path: jihad. ’ The notion of precognition brings free will into question, particularly when a certain individual appears in visions of the future but dies before it happens. It becomes a universe where individual free wills are all acting upon one another in an attempt to control the narrative of time. ’ And what [Paul] saw was a time nexus within this cave, a boiling of possibilities focused here, wherein the most minute action—a wink of an eye, a careless word, a misplaced grain of sand—moved a gigantic lever across the known universe. He saw violence with the outcome subject to so many variables that his slightest movement created vast shiftings in the pattern. ’ History is written by the winners, or so the saying goes, and much of this novel focuses on the way the narrative of time is constructed through the mythologizing of people and events. ‘ History will call us wives, ’ Jessica says to Chani, assuring her that her role as the lover to Paul will not be usurped by the princess he marries for the throne. Much of the book shows the dynamics between Paul as the Man and Paul as the myth, with characters like Stilgar recognizing that by being in service to the myth they too will be immortalized in the stories. Narratives become a form or power, and, as I’ll discuss soon, can be a form of control. Perhaps it is because power and control are so central to this novel that it feels so very timeless and just as applicable to 2021 as it did to 1965. In regards to power, leadership also becomes another key theme. ‘ Power and fear, ’ House Atreides Duke Leto says, ‘ The tools of statecraft, ’ a sentiment later echoed with all the same key terms by Baron Harkonnen. The two leaders are set up at the start as foils to each other, each trying to have their grip on Arrakis (there are some strong colonialism themes in this book and it delves into how troubling it is and how even those we might view as the savior turn out to be just another oppressor and colonizer) but their leaderships are defined by Leto’s rule through caring for his people while Harkonnen sees everyone as a useful pawn. ’ A leader, you see, is one of the things that distinguishes a mob from a people. He maintains the level of individuals. Too few individuals, and a people reverts to a mob. ’ Having recently finished The Dispossessed , I could have preferred some more voices in this book looking for better forms of ruling that don’t involve exploitation, but that’s not what this book is about so I’ll move on. What this book really focuses on is the ways power can be maintained, which crops up most in this novel through use of religion. ‘ But it's well known that repression makes a religion flourish, ’ we read, and the harsh life on Arrakis makes it the perfect setting where indoctrination of religion for the purpose of power can shape a community and unite them. Religion is a form of storytelling, having the people all believe in one shared story with all its myths and promises. ‘ You deliberately cultivated this air, this bravura, ’ Jessica instructs Paul, ‘ you never cease indoctrinating. ’ The stronger the shared faith, the more easily a leader can make them do what they need. It also helps that everyone is high as shit all the time. ‘ Religion and law among our masses must be one and the same, ’ Kynes's father says: ‘ An act of disobedience must be a sin and require religious penalties. This will have the dual benefit of bringing both greater obedience and greater bravery. We must depend not so much on the bravery of individuals, you see, as upon the bravery of a whole population. ’ Religion is being used constantly to shape the people for the purpose of their leaders, even in what seems an admirable purpose of turning desert Arrakis into a green paradise (and without a religious idea of paradise, how can a people who only know dry dirt and hardship even imagine a paradise?). ‘ The real wealth of a planet is in its landscape, how we take part in that basic source of civilization—agriculture. ’ This latter bit is also extremely key to Dune. The planet itself is practically a character in the novel, much in the ways the landscape is like a character in Westerns. The landscape of Arrakis truly shapes the people there, and we see a contrast between Arrakis and Caladan and how water as a precious resource on Arrakis changes many customs. Such as how spitting at a person is a sign of respect on Arrakis. Changing the environment on Arrakis is an interesting concept because, in order to make it thrive, what would the cost be? Would it disrupt spice, thereby collapsing the galaxy’s economy? Can these people ever be free, because doing so would require the complete dismantling of the governmental systems currently ruling? Can I try this spice? I would like to try the spice. There is also something to be said about the harshness of an environment being an ideal place for strenght in unity around a cause to crop up. Le Guin explores this in The Dispossessed as well, with the anarchist planet having a similar dry desert vibe as Arrakis and scarcity being a major player in what keeps the people bonded and working together. The Fremen are tough because of their environment, similiarly the Sardaukar are trained in extremely harsh environments as well. Dune plays a lot with ideas on how fascism and strongmen can quickly rise to power in times of economic instability—or the threat of it—and here the difficult planets tend to produce the most deadly fighters. Mix religion in and you have an instant army if you can convince everyone you are the chosen one. There is so much more to discuss in this book, particularly the Bene Gesserits and the Guild who are pulling a lot of strings, or just how friggen awesome the worms are. This is a big book with a lot of big ideas, and also a lot of ambiguity to them that I really appreciate. It is certainly a precursor for a lot of popular epics to follow. George Lucas certainly took notes and I imagine George R.R. Martin read this and said “wait, you can just kill beloved characters that easily!?” before rewriting Duke Leto as Ned Stark. While I can concede to those who find it boring and dry, I rather enjoyed all the history and lore and found this to be incredibly fun. 4.5\/5"

        "text":"People often forget that this series is what innovated our modern concept of science fiction (up until Neuromancer and The Martix, at least). Dune took the Space Opera and asked if it might be more than spandex, dildo-shaped rockets, and scantily-clad green women. Herbert created a vast and complex system of ancient spatial politics and peoples, then set them at one another's throats over land, money, and drugs. Dune is often said to relate to Sci Fi in the same way that Tolkien relates to Fantasy. I'd say that, as far as paradigm shift, this is widely true. Both entered genres generally filled with the odd, childish, and ridiculous and injected a literary sensibility which affected all subsequent authors. Few will challenge the importance of Star Wars' effect on film and storytelling in general, but without Dune, there would be no Star Wars. Princess Alia, the desert planet, the Spice, the Bene Gesserit, and Leto II all have direct descendants in the movies. It is unfortunate that Lucas seems to have forgotten in these later years that his best genius was pilfered from Herbert, Campbell, and Kurosawa. Though I have heard that the later books do not capture the same eclectic energy as the first, Dune itself is simply one of the most original and unusual pieces of Sci Fi ever written. Read it, Starship Troopers, Ringworld, Neuromancer, and Snowcrash and you'll know everything you need to about Sci Fi: that you want more."

Ohmygod look what that fake-looking piece of plastic shit is doing to poor MacLachlan's nose? How was he even able to act with that thing pushing his nostrils to the side of his face? I can't stop looking at it! Anyway. I remember loving that movie when I was young. Ahhhh. I honestly didn't remember much about it other than it was sorta weird, there were giant worms, a bunch of people had glowing blue eyes, and Sting was in it. After listening to this audiobook, I decided to rewatch the movie and relive the good times. Wow. Just wow . What in the holy hell did I just watch? Because whatever it was, it certainly didn't have much to do with the actual book. There were some fucking weird changes that they made to the movie that really didn't do anything for the plot. Like that gross dude with the shit in his face that flew around in that goofy air suit? In the book, he's just a fat dude! And that thing they do where they all have drain plugs attached to their hearts? Not in the book, either! In fact, none of that fucknut crazy\/gross sci-fi shit is in the book. Blowing shit up with their voice guns? Nope. Bald Bene Gesserits? Nope. Bugs with butthole mouths? Nope. Mentat's with clip-on eyebrows who drink juice that gives them herpes lips? Nope. Captain Jean-Luc Picard going into battle with a pug? Fuck no! The list goes on and on... Not that it should matter. But it does! Because I was expecting something realllyreallyreally different, and if you go into this (like me) you may end up...well, not disappointed but maybe shocked? Having said that, I think the book was definitely better. There was no reason for ass-mouth monsters or oily rock stars in weird rubber underwear. It just makes a lot more sense the way Herbert wrote it. It's a magic is science tale set in space with an incredibly interesting look at how politics and religion can hold hands with each other and make war babies. I can see why people rave about it. It's honestly an incredibly insightful novel. You know, if you're into that sort of thing... A little dense , but worth it. But dense. That's worth saying twice because this thing is massive and you may get lost in it if giant word monsters aren't your jam when it comes to reading. I listened to the Audible version which is 21 HOURS (and 2 minutes!) long and might be the way to go for anyone looking for the easy way out. And I am ALWAYS looking for the easy way out."

        "text":"“I have seen a friend become a worshiper, he thought.” I don’t think I actually *enjoyed* this book. But I certainly respected the hell out of it. For a bit I thought I had it all figured out, pegged it as your bog-standard Chosen One story, and then it went where I didn’t think it’d go and neatly subverted my expectations. It tackled stuff that is uncomfortable and therefore is generally handwaved over in the usual SF epics. And for that I seriously respected this dense complex tome. We people tend to love the idea of a charismatic all-powerful leader who inspires faithful following and true fervor, that cult-like blind devotion . We give those leaders tremendous power to lead and decide and determine fates. So many stories rooted in the weight of our species collective history glorify this; so many countries still apparently yearn for powerful visionary leaders that others proclaim to be dictators. So many religions go to wars over the legacy left by a popular charismatic leader centuries ago, interpreting those legacies as the engine for the action, destruction, obedience. Hero worship. Messianic worship. Prophecies and tyrannies. Desire for a Savior to rescue you from the evil. Good intentions paving the road to hell. It all leads to terrifying places which we may be powerless to stop. “A leader, you see, is one of the things that distinguishes a mob from a people. He maintains the level of individuals. Too few individuals, and a people reverts to a mob.” This is a novel of a reluctant Messiah, the journey of a man becoming the Chosen One — but unlike the traditional story of a charismatic savior, this is a darker picture of the dangers of messianism and hero worship, of allowing blind devotion replace common sense . The book ends in an ambiguous place, and I presume the sequels may develop the theme or run away from it and make this a more traditional hero journey. But I certainly hope not. Because the dark implications of messianism say more about human nature than the happier stories based on the same idea, but with more idealism . We love our ideas of ideal benevolent rulers who can set things right, don’t we? Or the martyr figures inspiring “righteous” battles? Messiahs and figureheads seem to fulfill the deep-seated cultural longing for an inspirational leader, don’t they? Friends become followers and worshippers, and the metaphorical slope becomes quite slippery . “The Fremen have a simple, practical religion,\" he said. \"Nothing about religion is simple,\" she warned. But Paul, seeing the clouded future that still hung over them, found himself swayed by anger. He could only say: \"Religion unifies our forces. It's our mystique.\" \"You deliberately cultivate this air, this bravura,\" she charged. \"You never cease indoctrinating.\" \"Thus you yourself taught me,\" he said.” Yes, in Dune Frank Herbert hints at the dangers present in such ideas. What seems like your traditional hero’s journey turns out darker and more sinister. But it’s not the rise of an antihero either. It’s subtler than that, without actually being all that subtle. “No more terrible disaster could befall your people than for them to fall into the hands of a Hero,\" his father said. Paul Atreides, in his own words, is “something unexpected.” A son of a planetary Duke (because an interstellar post-technology future is actually feudal) and a highly trained Bene-Gesserit concubine of the Duke (basically a member of the order\/Sisterhood of superpowered highly trained mind ninjas with strong political worlds-changing ambitions and generations-long breeding experiments aimed at creation of a controllable superhero) , Paul fits very well the idea of a Messiah of the tribal resilient society of Fremen people of the harsh desert planet Arrakis , neatly fulfilling their religious prophecies (that may have been stealthily planted before by the above-mentioned supernatural ninja order) and possessing genetic superpowers himself, augmented by rigorous training and catalyzed by the ingestion of a magical wonder-drug known as spice . “He found that he no longer could hate the Bene Gesserit or the Emperor or even the Harkonnens. They were all caught up in the need of their race to renew its scattered inheritance, to cross and mingle and infuse their bloodlines in a great new pooling of genes. And the race knew only one sure way for this—the ancient way, the tried and certain way that rolled over everything in its path: jihad.” But Paul through his prescient powers can see what his mythologized destiny leads to. A galactic scale slaughter led by fanatics in his name. And there is not a way to escape it, once your life fits the mysticism of their faith (even if the faith and prophecies were stealthily prereplanted for sort of a similar purpose). Religious fanatics are destined to wage a brutal war that the Messiah is unable to stop. “When law and duty are one, united by religion, you never become fully conscious, fully aware of yourself. You are always a little less than an individual.” With great power comes great responsibility, and all that jazz. But is any of it actually worth it? Wouldn’t the world be better without the burden of Heroes? Are you destined to become exactly what you’re trying to avoid? All this is gently hinted at, laid out in the framework of the appealing Hero’s journey. It seems that should you desire, you can still easily choose to read it as a typical hero’s\/antihero’s story, just less idealistic than it could be. But that would be Star Wars and not Dune . “He was warrior and mystic, ogre and saint, the fox and the innocent, chivalrous, ruthless, less than a god, more than a man. There is no measuring Muad'Dib's motives by ordinary standards. In the moment of his triumph, he saw the death prepared for him, yet he accepted the treachery. Can you say he did this out of a sense of justice? Whose justice, then? Remember, we speak now of the Muad'Dib who ordered battle drums made from his enemies' skins, the Muad'Dib who denied the conventions of his ducal past with a wave of the hand, saying merely: \"I am the Kwisatz Haderach. That is reason enough.” And you also can’t help but be mesmerized by a harsh desiccated planet where life is focused on survival, where not even water but mere moisture is the most coveted and rarest thing, where hopes for a better, wetter, greener future quietly flourish, tied into messianic ideas but grounded in science. The place of nightmares, written vividly and skillfully, making me want to gulp down a gallon of drink just because I can, making me appreciate that my reality doesn’t hinge on surviving on my reclaimed bodily fluids. The world is harsh, unforgiving, brutal, hostile. The characters - well, mostly Paul, but to an extent his mother Jessica as well - are cold, calculating, composed and often very unsympathetic. Paul’s father values lives over property. Paul’s actions, on the other hand, lead to eyebrow-raising among his father’s old lieutenants who note the difference in priorities: “Nothing money won't repair, I presume,\" Paul said. \"Except for the lives, m'Lord,\" Gurney said, and there was a tone of reproach in his voice as though to say: \"When did an Atreides worry first about things when people were at stake?” It’s dense and complex, full of politics, short on actual science fiction but full of ruminations on human nature — and it leaves me feeling that all of this is a beginning of another cycle of violence, just with a new figurehead at the mast. As Terry Pratchett said, “But here's some advice, boy. Don't put your trust in revolutions. They always come around again. That's why they're called revolutions.” A new Hero or a new Messiah comes, and begets another cycle or struggle and violence, to be reset anew by a new figurehead sometimes in the future . All while sandworms quietly slither under the sand. ————— Oh yeah, there are sandworms, too. ————— 4 stars out of respect for Herbert’s subversive story that made me think. I’m content with the story ending here, with ambiguity and dread for what’s to come.[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>"

        "text":"Why You Should Read Dune (video): https:\/\/youtu.be\/oOomSvGXfaM Asking me to describe why Dune is so important to me is like asking a child to explain nuclear fusion. I do my best in the video linked above, but just know it probably isn't for the reasons you think. My journey to Dune becoming my absolute favorite book of all time goes all the way back to the mid-1990's upon finding it in my high school library and deciding to give it a try because I remembered my dad and brother watching the movie when I was a kid. At 15 years old, I got to the middle of \"book II\" and gave it a big fat DNF. I decided it just wasn't for me. At 17, for the 30th anniversary, I decided to try again and while I finished it that time, I thought the ideas were overly pretentious and way too out there. But a year went by and somehow, it was still in my head. I thought about it frequently and I began to ponder...did I actually really like it? I tried again the final weeks of my senior year of high school and became absolutely obsessed and it has stayed that way for almost the last 25 years. Dune is social science-fiction in that it's more concerned with the people and society than it is with hard science. Besides telling you that these navigators \"fold space\" for interstellar travel, Herbert doesn't bog you down with the math. He focuses more on the politics, cultures, religion, and philosophies of a world rich in the most valuable resource in the known universe, but barren in everything else. If you go into the story expecting a Star Wars style adventure, you're going to leave disappointed. Dune is extremely thought provoking and deals with the struggles of coming of age while the fate of the universe is on your shoulders. I'll also say that the book is certainly not for everyone. If you love things like ASOIAF and The Wheel of Time, there is no way this book won't be for you as both of those series borrowed heavily from the story Frank crafted. But I think it truly depends on where you are at in your life. Look, I just told you the story of how it took until my third reading for this to really click with me. Those who the story and lessons click with, it REALLY clicks with. But, again, this isn't a crowd pleaser and not everyone is going to love it, especially modern readers. So while I encourage those that are interested to read it, I expect more modern readers to not like it than like it. Not only is this the greatest science-fiction story of all time, but I believe it should be on mandatory reading lists in schools and everyone interested in the genre owe it to themselves to read the pillar of the genre they have come to love. Dune is every bit to science-fiction what Lord of the Rings is to fantasy."

        "text":"2021 Reread - 5* I was totally blown away by the recent movie version of this, that much so I decided to revisit and revaluate my opinion of this extraordinary book. So, I read it again six years on and this is something I said I would never do because I found it so difficult to read the first time. It wasn’t the complexity of the world and politics, but the narration style which totally perplexed and frustrated me. Though I think that was more to do with my immaturity as a reader at the time than anything else. This is a difficult one, but it’s worth it. This time I was impressed with everything: the intelligence of the writing, the details of the world and the intricate nature of the storytelling. There’s just so much brilliance here. And it’s entertaining. It’s interesting. The balance is perfect. The Freman culture is driven by ideas of ecology, efficiency and waste reduction. And whilst they are not without their faults, the sense of oneness and appreciation they have for their home planet is a strikingly important commodity. I found them fascinating to read about and of the many thing this novel has going for it, they are the jewel in Herbert’s crown. I want to see more of this world. Original Review (2015) - 3.5* I could never give Dune five stars because I really struggled to get into the novel in the beginning. It has taken me almost two months to read. This, for me, is a very long time to spend on a book. It took me so long to read because I found the writing style incredibly frustrating. I had to read whole chapters again so I could get the gist of the plot. This was more so in the beginning, which I found particularly hard to read because of the author’s way of shifting between the thoughts of multiple characters. I found this very annoying; however, I persevered over my initial despondency towards the writing, and plodded on through the book. I’m glad I did so because in the end I did come to really enjoy it. Indeed, the story is fantastic, but the writing will always remain unbearable for me. A truly brilliant plot Dune is to science fiction what The Lord of the Rings is to high fantasy; it is the novel that officially, and unarguably, defines the genre. The story begins with the house of Atreides accepting the Dukedom of the planet Dune. The former Baron has been ousted by the Emperor, and is no longer of consequence. Well, that is how it initially appears. Very early on it revealed that the whole thing is a political ploy to bring the house of Atreides to its knees. The Baron lies in wait, and is ready to strike against the new, and benevolent, approach the Duke uses on the Fremen. The Fremen are the natives of the dessert planet; thus, they know how to survive its harshness above all others. They do this through their frugal approach to water. They value it above all else, and will never waste a drop in earnest. The Baron Harkonnen, as a chide against the natives, squanders water in the cruellest ways. He, and his dinner guests, throw cups of water on the floor of the dinner hall; it was his tradition. The wasted water was soaked up with towels, which the Baron allowed the Fremen to suck the water out of. When the Duke enters he rejects this custom, and is more respectful to the Fremen way of life. He and his son and heir Paul, who is the protagonist of this novel, go as far as to try the Fremen’s grossly effective water saving suits. These Stillsuits, quite literally, recycle all the water the body wastes and feeds it back to its wearer. The Fremen way is the right way This early familiarity, with the Fremen technology, no doubt helps to keep Paul’s mind open when he is later forced to live amongst the Fremen. Paul is somewhat of a marvel; he is prophecy’s chosen one. When he eventually gains the trust of the Fremen they allow him to choose a Fermen name. He calls himself after their most revered prophet: Muad'Dib. They accept this and follow him as their leader. His inherited title of Duke dictates that he is their lord, but their religion determines their real loyalty. He has to, quite literally, fight for every ounce of their trust. Indeed, it does not come cheap, and will only be given to one who is a member of their people. “Without change something sleeps inside us, and seldom awakens. The sleeper must awaken.” Thus, Paul becomes their saviour. Consequently, he receives heaps of character development through this book. He goes form boy to the revered leader of a nation. The Fremen, like Paul, want the evil Baron Harkonnen gone from their planet. They do no want a cruel oppressor who is ignorant to their ways: they want Paul. I think the imagination behind the Fremen culture really is wonderful. They have efficiently adapted to survive their harsh planet. To emphasise this point you need only look at the fact that off-world humans live in fear of the giant Sandworms that infect the planet whereas the Fremen ride them as a coming of age ritual. Indeed, Paul has to ride a worm if the Fremen are to follow him. Deep characters The result of this is a very complex, and intriguing plot. I found the first third of this book to be very perplexing initially. This is a world we are told about rather than shown at the start. We hear about the Fremen but do not truly understand them till the very end. I was very overwhelmed at the beginning, and in all honesty I do think this novel merits a re-read to further establish my understanding of it. This did affect my rating because it inhibited by enjoyment of the book. “Deep in the human unconscious is a pervasive need for a logical universe that makes sense. But the real universe is always one step beyond logic.” Indeed, aside from Paul there is a whole host of dynamic, and well rounded, characters. His mother is to be the new revered mother of the Fremen people, which for someone of her age is quite remarkable. There is also the captain of Duke Leto’s household guard who is a very deep and honourable individual. As much as I came to like these characters I was still frustrated with the writing of them in the beginning. I found it difficult to read scenes in which up to four characters internal thoughts are portrayed alongside their dialogue. It wasn’t always clear who was thinking. I much prefer a narrative that is focalised through one person. Well, at least one person per chapter. Overall, I thought the idea behind this novel was utterly fantastic. However, my personal reaction to the writing style limited my overall enjoyment of the book. I do intend to read some of the sequels. However, I do not have any intention of doing so in the near future. Maybe, in a couple of years I will return to the brilliant, and annoyingly written, world of Dune. __________________________________ You can connect with me on social media via My Linktree . __________________________________"

        "text":"Seems as if they might be duned to be addicted to spice, all good old barbarians on magic mushrooms style. Quite dusty, especially regarding how to put the different parts of this behemoth series in the big picture of sci-fi because each part (of the 3 I´ve read so far and very probably won´t restart trying to read the 4th and 5th part) presents something different. Essentially, only this, the first one, is a real science fantasy epos, while the others are mostly circulating around the characters' special skills and family problems without much meta, plot, or different settings. Just this first milestone is big in the epic worldbuilding department and some other things I´ll try to point my primate fingers at. As unrealistic as water scarcity in such a highly developed galactic civilization seems, it´s a perfect explanation for creating the blue eyed mind mutants and the misandrist female breeding gang, that don´t ever need to kick male butts, because they preemptively avoid that situation to become real. Real life implications and innuendos. I don´t know if Herbert had any kind of real civilizations, cultures, or traditions in mind when he constructed the tribes, today it would probably fall under any kind of politically correct bigoted do gooder codex, but there could lie a ton of creative writing gold in exploring this question of how to implement any past or present movement, society, tradition, faith into different sci-fi subgenres. Because how the traditions, monsters, and badass special moves of the inhabitants influence the planetary and intergalactic trade and travel balance is slowly presented to the reader, while the impact of the wonderful spice expands its glow towards total domination. Don´t take drugs except they make you superhuman As so often, a prescription free pharmaceutical wonder cure can solve all of your problems until corporate interests come and ruin everything by using anything in their armory to get control over the precious resource of psychohistoric psi precognition power. The idea of one substance changing the whole balance of power of the galaxy is big in many sci-fi series and especially terrifying for each arrogant, high tech civilization, because an animal creating impervious shields, an immortality tonic, a mind altering super drug, etc., could enable far weaker, steampunky tribes to destroy them. Classic barbarian hordes on magic mushrooms looting Rome style. Bene Gesserit Who says that centuries long, epigenetic, elitist breeding programs have to be completely evil all the time? Except for the poor lovers aroused by the wrong, not arranged partner, stupid Romeo and Juliet syndrome complexes, you have to see the bigger picture and control your hormones and feelings and sacrifice some biochemical illusions to create the ÜberPsi mentat mentalist mind penetrator. However, it works with less evil too. Together with the spice, this elite mental mind control academy with the aim to finally create the ultimate space JC messiah figure to defecate rainbows, freaking galactic peace, pink unicorns, and gold, is the backbone of the whole trilogy, because impacts of both and the excessive use of it as MacGuffins and Chekhovs plot devices lead to the question: Is this still really sci-fi or not more a high fantasy thing with some sci-fi elements? Well, highly subjectively, yes, Dune is mostly psi fantasy dressed in futuristic clothes with some faith, tech, technobabble (rare), and trade in between, which makes it one of the most outstanding and unusual sci-fi works, I mean fantasy camouflaged as sci-fi. Tricky, one is so indoctrinated to call this thing sci-fi that it took me a reread and absorbing many reviews to realize what´s really going on. I´m really not sure about this whole thing, I´ve read a ton of sci-fi and my alien mind parasite, in a kind of perverted symbiosis with the xenovirus making me look fresher I deliberately bought for this purpose like a tapeworm therapy to lose weight (you don´t want to know what this costs on the alien bioweapons black market, the second half of my immortal soul exactly), tells me that there still would a lot of story without the sci-fi elements, while close to nothing would be there after removing fantasy, faith, drugs, and mind penetrating abilities, so, yea. I mean, even the planet itself doesn´t really has sci-fi fractions or something, the space around it is kind of empty without many sci-fi parties, cyborgs, aliens, everything substantial seen in close to any big sci-fi series. This leads me to An unpopular and possibly controversial opinion It could be that Herbert is, and I am just talking about the sci-fi aspect, a bit overrated or, let´s precisely define it, overhyped as a sci-fi author because he is more of a fantasy writer. This couldn´t happen in a fantasy world, because parts of the legions of readers of the genre don´t want aliens and Clarketech mixed in their magic, not to speak of the suspension of disbelief problem that often comes with sudden future tech elements in fantasy, that´s just disgusting. The other way round, as with Dune, is much easier, just put some sci-fi around fantasy and everything just rolls perfectly. Is terraforming destroying cultural heritage or making inhabitable worlds paradises? The ethical implications of this question are another sci-fi old school vehicle, especially if the terrible acid rain, high gravity, parasite infested, or dirty desert land is the only region where the special, red plotline device can grow and thrive. One could go so far as to ask if there are real life examples on earth, conservation vs corporate environmentalism, greenwashing and stuff (spoiler warning: conservation lost, earth is dying), and how this should be dealt with in decades, centuries, or millennia when we (I hope you are immortal too thanks to alien symbiont virus cooperation like me, if you aren´t, poor you, may I infect you? Just 20.000 of whatever your fringe financial system uses as fiat money that will be worthless as soon as natural apocalypse, mutually assured destruction, or alien invasion make it obsolete, and you get the parcel. Shipping not included.) start manipulating weather, geophysics and- chemistry, and climate of other worlds to make it sexy, tropical, tourist friendly paradises at the low cost of exterminating all alien life, but this would be a bit far fetched. Herberts´place in the sci-fi or sci-fa hall of fame. That´s tricky, especially because he just couldn´t keep delivering after the third part. I´ve played around with the fourth and fifth part, but had to abandon it because it escalated to too much unmotivated, philosophical drivel without a real plotline and a place in the big picture of the series, Herbert just didn´t manage to hold it all together. What made the first three parts, that they are kind of eccentric, ingenious standalones without the classic space opera series uniting plotline and style, great, kind of destroyed the rest of the series. Because he had no more vision for the meta, high sci fa elements, Herbert lost control over his own creation and just manufactured hearthless shells to sell more books. But that doesn´t mean that the first three parts aren´t milestones of the interdisciplinary genre, exploring it in new ways no one imagined before while reaching Lem-, Clarke-, and Asimov levels of subtle, intelligent dialogues, innuendos, connotations, and character driven development. It´s something unique, special, and definitively not for anyone because of its high entry barriers that may annoy some readers, but don´t let yourself be easily deterred by that, it´s totally worth it once you´re in and high as heck and addicted forever to the wonderful, delicious spice melange.

        "text":"Dune is often considered a masterpiece of 20th-century American science fiction. In part, the book owes its reputation to the film adaptation David Lynch directed in the early 1980s (although this movie was, and still is, not considered one of his best). Frank Herbert wrote a novel of epic proportions, in other words, a space opera , with its intergalactic feudal society, its decadent (if not evil) empire and its band of rebels: the book was published some ten years before the first instalment of the Star Wars series. Indeed, along with Asimov’s (overrated) Foundation stories, it was George Lucas’ primary source of inspiration. One of the most exciting aspects of Herbert’s creation is the multi-cultural world he depicts. Each house (Atreides, Harkonnen, etc.), each planet (Arrakis, Giedi Prime, Caladan...), each group (the Fremen, the Bene Gesserit, the Guild, the Emperor’s suite and the Sardaukars) has its specific flavour, its own culture, its language — the comprehensive index at the end of the book is utterly fascinating. For each of these cultures, Herbert borrowed traits from traditions (ancient or contemporary) he knew well in reality, especially from the Middle East. In particular, Paul Atreides \/ Muad’Dib’s story among the Fremen is redolent of the historical events around T.E. Lawrence and the Arab revolt against the Ottoman Empire. And Paul’s crusade on Arrakis is told, as though it were ancient history, in the chronicles by the Princess Irulan at the start of each chapter. Herbert describes his fictional world and characters in great detail, which contributes to the richness of his narrative, but I found these descriptions somewhat boring and, especially, the middle of the book is a bit dragging for that reason. In my view, the most impressive parts of this novel are the dialogues, where Herbert simultaneously reveals what the characters are saying and thinking. This technique lends a sense of duplicity and scheming to almost every interaction. Everyone is plotting one way or another so that the whole thing ends up being like a great Shakespearean play, with dialogues and asides, tyrants and pretenders. What confirms this impression is not only the theme of the exiled Duke (see As You Like It , King Lear , or The Tempest ), but also the repeated scenes of fencing duels throughout, with feints and poisoned tips: a clear allusion to the endings of Hamlet and Macbeth , for instance. Edit : A word about Denis Villeneuve’s new film adaptation of Herbert’s novel (part 1, 2021). Comparisons are odious and obviously wouldn’t be to David Lynch’s advantage. This is a Dune version for a new generation of fans and an epic movie on par with Peter Jackson’s Lord of the Rings trilogy, in the early 2000s. The settings (filmed in Scandinavia and the Middle East) are breathtaking, and the actors have so much going for them. But what strikes me the most in this new version is the sense that everything is overwhelming and sublime: the massive architecture, the crushing machines, the extreme weather conditions, the earth-shattering landscapes, the thunderous music, the tragic events, the repulsive foes. From the relenting waves of Caladan to the searing and unending skies of Arrakis, everything assumes an oceanic and staggering dimension."

        "text":"I blame the movie. I was an avid but novice fantasy and sci-fi reader in 1984 when David Lynch’s Dune rolled out as a big-budget adaptation of the 1965 classic book. It was an artistic and box-office failure with Roger Ebert calling it “a real mess, an incomprehensible, ugly, unstructured, pointless excursion.” Numerous references were made to its excessive length, particularly a tv edition that was over 3 hours long. I never did pick up the classic sci-fi book, assuming the commentary heard about the movie applied to the book. All that changed when I broke my finger and found myself with a lot of extra time on my hands (groan). Besides, sandworms. Dune has a lot of ingredients that don’t fit into my preferred stories, yet the gestalt was not only tolerable, but engrossing. It begins with the Atreides family preparing to shift their holding from their current home to the planet of Arrakis. The Emperor has given the Atreides the territory and trade on the planet of Arrakis, formerly under control of their enemies, the Harkonnen. The planet Arrakis is hot, arid and generally hostile to life. There is, however, a small population of native, fierce Freman who have managed to build an existence in the desert. Paul Atreides is the young heir of the family, and mystical testing reveals he might be the one prophesied. Paul undergroes a rapid growth curve, facilitated by his teacher Dr. Yeuh and his father’s advisors. But it is in the desert that Paul will discover his strength as well as his new people. Seriously, now. Honestly, I have to wonder how much of this like is generational. If Sanderson or Rothfuss wrote this book, two chapters in Dune would have made a whole book, and while detail may have been added, it likely would have made for a book as slow as the movie. I liked the scope of Dune, and that there is a resolution to the initial conflict. It is also interesting that despite the volume of concepts packed in here, with political maneuvers, terraforming, technology, cultural assimilation, and mysticism all playing roles that I didn’t find it overwhelming, perhaps because so much is genre-familiar. On the downside, it could have perhaps used a bit more transitions, particularly near the end when months at a time are skipped. Writing was solid; nothing really stood out, but it told the story well. There’s some vague mysticism that might irritate those who like explanations. It was a bit of an eye-roller to have the chief villain be a fat, gay, sadistic pedophile, but Herbert really isn’t thinking outside the trope character box much (it’s not enough that he sentences people to death but he has to be physically abhorrent? And gay?). World-building is fun, but standard desert. Overall, I’m glad that I finally took the time to read it and put those old assumptions to rest. I love a good hero."

        "text":"3.5\/5 Stars Dune oh Dune, seems like I need to raise my Shield Wall for this review. Dune is one of the most important pieces of literature for the Sci-Fi genre. I’ve been raking my brain for hours on how to properly explain the importance of Dune in the sci-fi literature but you know what? I dune (hehehe) think it’s necessary for me to do so. If you truly wanna know why, you can search it on whatever search engine you use and you'll find hundreds of articles or reviews on why this book is that important; and they’ll do a much better job than me. I won’t even deny any of them because, in my opinion, this book was truly revolutionary. Dune didn’t become the number one highest selling Sci-fi novel of all time for no reason; like Brian Herbert said, it is to Sci-Fi, what the LOTR trilogy is to fantasy. Theoretically, if I’m reviewing this by putting my head as someone from 1960’s or 1970’s, I know I would think of this book as my bible. 1965 was the year when Dune was published for the first time, 24 years before I was born. There are just too many groundbreaking ideas, world-building, that would become the inspirations for many Sci-fi in our time; I only realized this after reading this book. I mean, the gigantic Sandworm alone has inspired many video games to use it as a common monster or enemy. Picture: Dune by Marc Simonetti Desert planet, Stillsuits, space exploration, and Zen Buddhism, Dune was truly a groundbreaking novel, almost everything in this book somehow seems prophetic because it has predicted our current society, especially when it comes to faith, emotional control, empathy, and the importance of ecology and scarcity. “The mind commands the body and it obeys. The mind orders itself and meets resistance.” Part of what made this book was great for me was Herbert’s prose. I haven’t read enough classic to claim it was classical, but Herbert’s prose was definitely unique to me. It has a lot of freedom by writing it from a limited omniscient narrative; changing POV’s repeatedly in a single chapter without any warning. This is, honestly, one of my biggest pet peeves in my usual read, but Herbert made it work because all his characters were really well written, distinct in their personality, and the dialogues are really well dune (HEHEHE). Plus, there are so many motivational and extremely philosophical quotes that seem to make this book a combination of Sci-Fi & self-help book, such as: “It is so shocking to find out how many people do not believe that they can learn, and how many more believe learning to be difficult.” And of course, the most famous and one of the best quote I’ve ever read out of any book “I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.” I can’t believe I have gone through life without knowing about this litany against fear. It’s applicable in any kind of hardship we faced in real life, and I know it will be one of my motto starting from now. If I’m judging this book solely from how significant this book was, I’ll give it maximum score in a heartbeat. However, I’m reviewing this based on one question and how I rated all the books I read: was it enjoyable? The answer is yes and no, it was a mixed bag. The first part of this book was incredible, I couldn’t put down the book and everything was so interesting and compelling. Then comes the second part, where the pacing just became really draggy and somehow, boring. However, my hope was restored for a while during the third act, until the anti-climax happened. My expectation is obviously at fault here but hey, this book is the number one highest selling sci-fi book of all time and one of the most highly acclaimed book, I expected there to be a mind-blowing climax sequences to close the book in an epic way. But no, there wasn’t any. Not only it felt anti-climactic, Herbert’s prose in describing settings and actions didn’t age well or up to current standard. The main reason for this is that this is a book that relies heavily on character’s dialogues to do everything; world-building, plot, characterizations were done solely through dialogues. This leads to the great plot but weak action sequences and no vivid settings. Sure there was some explanation on the settings, but other than the planet—which is just a desert, just search Sahara or Planet Tatooine and voila—the interiors were given only brief description, which makes it hard to imagine; I had to look up some artworks to be able to immerse myself in the settings of the book. Overall, Dune was truly a revolutionary book for its time that is filled with tons of imaginative and fantastic ideas. Although there were some parts that disappointed me, I still liked the book and I finally understand why there are so much discussion and praises around this book. I recommend this to every Sci-fi fans for its importance and also, it’s good to know where most fantastic Sci-Fi you’ve read or you’re reading now got its idea from. However, this is also where I’ll stop with the series. You can find this and the rest of my Adult Epic\/High Fantasy & Sci-Fi reviews at BookNest"

        "text":"[UPDATED] I reread Dune for the first time in several decades and immensely enjoyed it. I also went back to watch the original cult feature film by David Lynch and had quite mixed feelings - while it was close to the overall aesthetic that Frank Herbert describes with the gorgeous desert sets and the terrifying worms, the parts of the story that were necessarily culled out was disturbing (that and the woeful special effects at the time trying (and IMHO failing) to visualize the personal shields that the characters wear in hand-to-hand combat). For those who are just discovering Dune for the first time, it is essentially a messianic story on a desert planet (think of Jesus or perhaps Mohammed on Tatooine) in a universe dominated by a cartel (the Guild also known as CHOAM) with a monopoly on a drug (called mélange) derived from a rare material (spice) available only on the desert planet Arrakis (Dune). This drug is so powerful that it allows the Guild (and later Maud'dib) to leverage space-time singularities to defy the speed of light and travel anywhere in the universe. Overlaid on this foundation, the epic battle of the feudal houses of the noble Atreides and the evil Harkkonen houses rages, the betrayal of the former by the latter explicitly endorsed by the Emperor (himself an almost impuissant pawn of the Guild as well). All that to say that the fabric of the story is multilayered and as complex and complete a universe as you will find in George RR Martin or Dan Simmons. There are several enhanced human species running around: the Mentats who have been cerebrally enhanced to be able to calculate like supercomputers (computers themselves having been banned!) and each then uses their predictive analytics for their assigned Dukes (or the Emperor) and the Bene Gesserit cult who are a sort of quasi-religious non-celibate nuns who have honed perception and language to the point of having developed nearly superpower-level strengths of persuasion which are almost universally feared and vilified as sorcery in the rest of the universe. Paul Atreides, heir to the throne, is born to Jessica, a Bene Gesserit, possessed some of these powers and when the family moves to Arrakis (part of the aforementioned Harkkonen plot) from their home planet Caladon, he appears to the native Freeman population as perhaps a fulfillment of their messianic prophecies and hopes. In perhaps the most critical departure from the book, the Lynch movie does not really show Paul questioning the awesome power that he possesses and his assumption of the mantle as the Arrakis Messiah, the Maud'dib (something that the 2021 film by Denis Villeneuve does thankfully address). In the book, one aspect that I loved was how Paul struggled with this messianic destiny and did everything he could to subvert it. One of the unique gifts he received, presumably as the rare and unique offspring of a Bene Gesserit, was the ability to see possible outcomes (like a Mentat) and thus he could take decisions based on the most likely foreseen outcome. It made for great reading. The other great thing about Dune is the aesthetic of this desert planet with impossibly huge worms under the surface who are mysteriously connected to spice and pose a danger to all creatures in the desert except for the Freeman. The still suit which recycles body water in the deep desert was brilliant as was the ever-present obsession with \"water debt\" of the Freemen. I really felt like I was walking unevenly (must not attract the worms!) through the sand with Jessica and Paul before their fateful encounter with the Freemen. Dune is a well-deserved classic for all the reasons I mentioned above and probably much more that I missed. I have read it twice and gotten almost entirely different things out of it each time. I have since read all the canonical Frank Herbert books in the series and enjoyed it all immensely. [UPDATE] I am looking forward to Denis Villeneuve's Dune in October 2021. The previews I have seen so far seem to be quite coherent with respect to the book. I was a fan of Lynch's Dune and am curious to see what Villeneuve does with this one. Feel free to comment below. [UPDATE] Villeneuve’s 2021 film covers half of the book and does a fantastic job as both an homage to Herbert’s book and Lynch’s film. The casting, costumes, CGI, and script are all top-notch. Dune lovers have every reason here for rejoicing. One key difference from the Lynch film is that we do not see the Guild Navigators, so we can hope that they show up in the second half! [UPDATE 2024] I loved the 2nd DV adaptation especially the use of color and black and white as well as character arcs. There were a few deviations from the original, but nothing as idiosyncratic as Lynch’s rain on Arakis In 1984. I can’t wait to see what he does with Dune Messiah.

        "text":"3.5\/5 Honestly, I never know exactly how to start my review after finishing a nearly nine hundred pages book, but I guess I'll start by saying that I definitely enjoyed it, but was it a life-changing reading experience? Unfortunately, not for me. This book is considered a classic of the science fiction genre, Frank Herbert did an amazing, or even one of a kind job, creating the entire universe in which Dune takes place, all the characters, descriptions and practically everything in this book was simply fascinating. I really wanted to be one of those people who closes this book and is completely in love with it, and then when someone asks if they've read it say \"Yeah, I love Dune, it's my favorite book.\" but as it turns out, I'm not that person. At least, yet. This is the first story in a six-volume series, so I hope that changes. Like I said, I liked it, but I genuinely think I would have loved it if I hadn't watched the movies. In my opinion, the movies are even a close-to-being-perfect adaptation of the Herbert’s work and pretty much everything that happened in the book also happened in the first two films - with some small changes and a few scenes were in a different order, but it didn't change the fact that I still very much enjoyed watching both of them. Dune I and Dune II, being great adaptations, unfortunately meant that watching them before reading the book wasn't the best idea as I was bored for most of the story because I just knew what was going to happen. The first four hundred pages took me the longest to read because I watched Dune I twice, but thankfully it took me much less to finish the rest. The beginning (read the said first four hundred pages) were hard to read - which may not be much of an incentive for those planning to start I know - but the second half of the book even got me hooked. Frank's writing style may not have been entirely to my liking, the \"wow, what's happening\" moments didn't shock me as much as I thought they would, but the characters were amazing so I have to thank them because they are the reason for me being invested. Jessica was definitely my favorite here, followed by Paul, which I know is a boring answer, but what can I say, I liked them. They may even have become my favorite son and mother duo in books, which says a lot considering I've read a lot of stories in my life. \"If you harm my son,” she said, “you’ll have me to meet. I call you out now. I’ll carve you into a joint of—\" “Mother.” Paul stepped forward, touched her sleeve. “Perhaps if I explain to Jamis how—” “Explain!” Jamis sneered.\" Finally ending my rant, because I didn't plan to write so much, which is basically still nothing, because you could talk and talk without the end about this book, but I definitely plan to continuing this series. Maybe I'll even manage to finish all six books this year, we'll see. I hope at least. —————— maybe I'll be able to read all six books by the time the next movie comes out (2027?) we'll see (I'm already having trouble with all the names)"

        "text":"I have to write this review without rhythm so that it won’t attract a worm. In the distant future Arrakis is a hellhole desert planet where anyone who doesn’t die of thirst will probably be eaten by one of the giant sandworms. It’s also the only place where the precious spice melange can be found so it’s incredibly valuable, and the honorable Duke Leto Atreides has been ordered by the Padishah Emperor to take over control of Arrakis from his mortal enemies, the House Harkonnen. While this seems like a great offer on the surface the Duke and his people realize that it’s actually a cunning trap being set by the Emperor and Baron Harkonnen. The only hope seems to be allying with the local populace called Fremen whose harsh environment has led them to become an incredibly tough and disciplined people, but they have their own vision of what Arrakis should be. They also have a prophecy about the coming of a messiah figure who will lead them to freedom, and the Duke’s son Paul looks like he may be exactly who they’ve been waiting for. This is classic sci-fi that really deserves the label. What Frank Herbert accomplished in one novel is stunning because he built a fascinatingly detailed universe in which the politics, religion, economics, espionage, and military strategy are all equally important. He then blended these more grounded concepts with bigger sci-fi ideas like being able to use spice to see through space-time, and the scope of that encompasses trying to pick the proper path through various potential timelines as well as free will vs. fate. I think one of the factors that helps this story stay timeless is that so much of it is based on what humanity becomes vs. trying to predict what futuristic technology would be like. This is a society that once had a war with machines and has since rejected any type of computers so people have developed to fill the gap with the help of the spice. The Mentats are trained to use data to predict outcomes. The Navigators of the Guild have used so much of the spice to help them move through space that they’re mutating. The all female Bene Gesserit have developed a variety of skills to place their members alongside positions of power to help advance their breeding scheme that spans generations. Herbert also cleverly came up with an excuse that explains why knives and hand-to-hand combat are so important with the idea of the personal body shields. So even though we still got a good sci-fi’s novel worth of cool gadgets the emphasis is on what the people can do and how that’s developed over a long period of time. It also adds a lot of depth to the political dimensions because all of these groups have different agendas that cause them all to mistrust each other, but because they all fill these various roles none can exist without the others. There are also parallels to our world that are still in play because the idea of a desert people caught up in the power struggles of various outsiders because of their valuable natural resource is an obvious allegory to the Middle East that still works today. Plus, the classic film Lawrence of Arabia came out a few years before Herbert published this, and you have to think that it had some influence on him because there are elements of the story that seem very much inspired by it. While the whole concept of a Chosen One has gotten a bit worn over time that’s not Herbert’s fault, and this is still a fantastic sci-fi story with big ideas that also works as space opera as well as being an epic adventure story."

        "text":"5 ⭐️ 2024 Re-read I have consumed the Water of Life and felt the spice agony. It has revealed to me the error of my past ways. But as the Lisan al Gaib teaches us, ways can change. Original Review 4 ⭐ A word of warning as you venture out to peruse the veritable smorgasbord of delectable reviews for this Sci-Fi\/Fantasy Classic! Be sure to do your Du(n)e diligence. Be wary of key phrases such as “I don’t usually read Fantasy\/Sci-Fi”, “Too many made-up words” or “I’m just reading before the movie comes out”. These individuals have come down with a bad case of bandwagonitis and any self-respecting Sci-Fier-er cannot count on their reviews being in any way accurate or beneficial! As I’m firmly placed in the 3rd category of Blockbuster-hungry fools, I’d advise you to immediately move on to another review, there’s nothing of value here. In fact, I won’t actually be writing a review, I’ll simply address one simple question: What is Dune? Dune is sand as far as the eye can see. Dune is the sphincter opening.... of a desert tent. Dune is thirst. The distillate esthers of reclaimed waste; the sour effluvia of humanity. It is greedily, no… joyously sipping your overweight Uncle’s recycled knacker sweat in a desperate effort to quell the rapid loss of your own bodily fluid. Dune is the Water of Life; Molecular Modification; a Transcendental Trinocular Acid Trip. The [Boy] with Kaleidoscope Eyes experiencing a Psychokinesthetic extension of self. Dune is the middle-aged man who, on hearing praise for his young sons, must always exclaim \"I taught them everything they know!\" Dune is defiance of fear. Dune is an unsettling change in POV turned familiar, insightful friend. Dune is saying very little with a great many words. Dune is Pardot Kynes, micro-ecology, patience and long-term goals. Dune is the Shai-Hulud; the scandalous straddling of a worm. Dune is religion, planted and shaped to the needs of the latest conquests and heraldic symbols. Dune is the Ghost Wind of the Jihad Dune is Alia, is Stewie Griffin. Dune is Feyd-Rautha, is Commodus playing Gladiator. Dune is a feint, within a feint, within a feint. Dune is the house Atreides, is the Greek house Atreus. Dune is the Kwisatz Haderach; the Messiah; a planet afflicted by a Hero. Dune is power and wisdom at the cost of humanity; Friendship lost to worship. ”Everything he touched brought death and grief… it was like a disease that could spread across the universe… How little the universe knows about the nature of real cruelty!”"

        "text":"When the epic and ensemble cast movie of Dennis Villenevue is about to release, I decided to choose this fantastic and also one of my favorite cult sci-fi series as flashback Saturday reading! ( it looks better than David Lynch- Kyle MacLachlan version but the looks may be deceiving! At least Timothy and Zendaya look so cool in those stylish clothes and grimy expressions on their faces) After nearly three decades later, holding this paperback into my hands is magical experience take me a time travel: my mom was banging on my room’s door and telling me go outside and be social, getting some tan, instead of self-isolating myself by burying my head into books for days and feeding myself with junk food! ( the past mom had no idea, billions of people in the earth will be forced to do the similar things I’ve done in 2020 because of different reasons . At least the 2020-me did exactly same things with one difference: I threw boozes into equation! ) When I reread the series I clearly understand why I became addicted to the them( I’m talking about entire books) Firstly you find yourself drawn into this journey after reading few pages because Herbert’s storytelling skills are extraordinarily. The meaningful interludes, the character development, the impressive world building transform you to the other universe that you never want to leave. The awakening parts of Paul who discovers his own abilities, epic dynasty battles, ominous sand worms , intrigues, revenge, mind games present us a perfect blend of political economical, sociological, theological themes. I advise you to read the books first to understand the deeply ideological messages and unique philosophy of the series because sometimes the screenwriters have hard time to absorb and reflect the entire soul of the book! At least by reading the main story by yourself, you may directly reach to the core! Here are my favorite quotes of the book: “I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.” “Deep in the human unconscious is a pervasive need for a logical universe that makes sense. But the real universe is always one step beyond logic.” “The mystery of life isn't a problem to solve, but a reality to experience.” “When religion and politics travel in the same cart, the riders believe nothing can stand in their way. Their movements become headlong - faster and faster and faster. They put aside all thoughts of obstacles and forget the precipice does not show itself to the man in a blind rush until it's too late.” “Hope clouds observation.” “It is impossible to live in the past, difficult to live in the present and a waste to live in the future.” “Fear is the mind killer.” “Once men turned their thinking over to machines in the hope that this would set them free. But that only permitted other men with machines to enslave them.”"

        "text":"TW: pedophilia and rape off page Although this is discussed as a highly influential work in scifi, now having read it, I do think we have evolved past the need for this to be part of the canon. This book was a bit of a mess with the characters, world, and plot all feeling a bit disjointed and half baked. The world, while interesting and obviously very detailed, is barely explained to the reader and relies heavily on the appendix without actually providing context in the story (with the exception of a few things like spice and the worms). These characters all felt a little flat and\/or underutilized. The plot felt like two separate books, while being peppered with themes of glorifying colonialism, white saviors, and lack of agency for most of the women. Although I understand that is a product of when it was written, it still points to how there are much better works that have been written since even if they were influenced by this. I’m interested to see what they do with the movie adaptation. I’ll have a review and discussion on my channel coming up."

        "text":"In my head, the purpose of this review is very clear. It is to convince YOU to read this book. Yes, you! Waste time no more. Go grab a copy. Machiavellian intrigue, mythology, religion, politics, imperialism, environmentalism, the nature of power. All this set in a mind-boggling, frighteningly original world which Herbert ominously terms as an \"effort at prediction\". Dune had me hooked! First impression The very first stirring I felt upon opening the yellowed pages of Dune was that of stumbling upon an English translation of an ancient Arabic manuscript of undeniable power and potence which had an epic story to narrate. The tone was umistakably sombre and I realized Herbert was not here to merely entertain me, he was here to make me part of the legend of Muad'Dib . It was intriguing and challenging and heck, since I live for challenges I decided to take this one up too, gladly. The challenge was the complexity and depth of the plot, which left me perplexed, in the beginning. I knew there were dialogues which meant much more than their superficial meaning and was unable to grasp at it. I felt a yawning chasm between Herbert's vision and my limited understanding of it. However, of course, I plodded on and could feel the gap closing in with every page much to my joy and relief. The Foreword \"To the people whose labours go beyond ideas into the realm of 'real materials'- to the dry-land ecologists, wherever they may be, in whatever time they work, this effort at prediction is dedicated in humility and admiration.\" The foreword makes it pretty clear that Frank Herbert isn't kidding around. This is a serious effort at predicting how our world is going to look two thousand years from now and by God, it's a bloody good and detailed prediction. However, the real merit in this effort lies in the commentary on our lives in the present. Why Frank Herbert is a genius The setting of the book is arid futuristic. the plot is driven by political mind games reminiscent of The Game of Thrones. The issues he tackles are as modern as the colour television. Herbert's genius manifests itself in his ability to combine the past, the present and the future in one sweeping elegant move called Dune. Plot and Setting Dune is set in a futuristic technologically advanced world which after the Butlerian Jihad (the bloody war between Man and Machines) has eliminated all computers and passed a decree declaring \"Thou shalt not make a machine in the likeness of a man's mind\" . Since there are no computers, the essential working of the galaxy is still medieval and feudal with heavy reliance on men and their dallying around. Lots of thriller potential right there. Men with superhuman analytical abilities called Mentats have taken the place of Computers. On the other hand, we have the Bene Gesserit , an ancient school of mental and physical training for female students (it gives them superhuman intuitive powers) who follow a selective breeding program which makes them feared and mistrusted through the Imperium. Their desired end product of this breeding program is the Kwisatz Haderach , a superman who’ll be able to glimpse into the future. How he’ll be able to do this is rooted in Herbert’s idea of determinism: given that one can observe everything and analyze everything, one can effectively glimpse the future in probabilistic terms. Quantum physics anyone? The Kwisatz Haderach is the proposed solution to the male-female dichotomy, between the analytical and intuitive. The plot of Dune is almost wholly set on the desert planet of Arrakis (also referred to as Dune), an arid wasteland where water is so scarce that men have to wear stillsuits which recycle human moisture for further consumption. The source of the galaxy’s interest in the planet is Melange , a spice which bestows upon one longevity and prescient powers. Everything on the planet is permeated with the spice, the air, the sand, the food. Everybody on the planet is hopelessly addicted to the spice, their only hope for survival being their continued intake of the spice. The Spacing Guild , the economic and trading monopolistic arm of the Galaxy badly needs the spice for interstellar transport. This is because their frigates travel faster than the speed of light and hence travel backward in time. The spice is the only way they can look into the future and see their way ahead. How cool is that! All the powers on the Galaxy are out to mine the spice, braving the sandworms, their name merely an euphemism, for they are gigantic 200 metre long creatures which always come digging through the sand whenever spice mining is undertook. Always . There’s also another little glitch. There exist on the planet, the kickass native desert tribal Fremen , whom the foreign powers look down with suspicion and disdain. The Fremen ethos is one of survival and scarcity, driven by tribalism and egalitarianism. Okay, I’ll stop right there. No more spoilers about this. Except that they value water to the extent that spitting on a person is the highest honour they can bestow upon him. Our protagonists are the Atreides family, consisting of the Duke, his Bene Gesserit concubine Jessica and their son Paul, who have been entrusted the stewardship of Arrakis. We discover the alien planet of Arrakis along with them, firstly with fear, suspicion and wonder and ultimately, love and respect. Paul Muad’Dib , however is no ordinary prince. There’s a teeny weeny chance he might be the Kwisatz Haderach , something which troubles him constantly and gives us our conflicted hero. The poor chap trips balls over the spice and has visions of black hordes pillaging and murdering around town bearing his flag and sees his dead body multiple times. My favourite character, however has to be the Baron Vladmir Harkonnen , the most evil character I’ve ever come across in my literary excursions. He is ruddy ruthlessness, he is virile villainy, he is truculent treachery. He executes the inept chess players in his employ which says oodles about his badassery and his fondness for cold-blooded logic. He sees everything in simplistic chess terms. What is my best move? What is my opponent’s best move? Is there anything I can do to completely squash his move? Is there a tactic which leads to mate in three? Themes In this setting, Herbert does so much, it’s unbelievable. Religion, politics, the dynamic nature of power, the effects of colonialism, our blatant destruction of our environment are themes which run parallel to the intensely exciting and labyrinthine plot. He shows the paramount importance of myth making and religion for power to sustain over long periods of time. Man, as a political animal is laid completely bare. Real life Now these are my thoughts about what Herbert could have meant to be Arrakis- It makes perfect sense. Herbert draws heavy inspiration for the religious ideology of Muad’Dib from Islam. He says “When religion and politics ride in the same cart and that cart is driven by a living Holy man, nothing can stand in the path of such a people.” which is the philosphy of the politics of Islam. Islamism in a nutshell. The spice, much desired by everyone, is the oil. Baron Vladmir Harkonnen is symblomatic of the wily Russians. The Desert foxes Fremen are representative of the native Saudi desert-dwelling Bedouin tribe who have a strongly tribe-oriented culture and undoubtedly value water in equal measure. And the ultimate loser is the environment. Why do good books get over? I almost forget this is a science fiction novel, it’s that real. It is also scary and prophetic. It is a reading experience that will leave you dreaming of the grave emptiness of Arrakis and make you wish you were there to brave it all in the privileged company of the noble Fremen. Frank Herbert achieves the pinnacle of what a sci-fi author aspires to rise to; authentic world building."

Now I have this and Little Women I actually got from their site. I need to get more as I can 😬 ✅Reread 2022 to try to complete series! (I need to get the awesome audio too) 4.5 Stars LOOK DAMN IT! OMG! Mel 🖤🐶🐺🐾 •••••••••••••••• I was so worried that I wouldn't understand a thing in this book. I will admit there are some things that went over my head but for the most part I figured it out. I remember a billion and 65 years ago I watched the movie and was like what the? Basically all I remember is Sting and sandworms. I would love to watch it again and see if I understand it more after reading the book. I'm still not sure what all the spices were about on Arrakis. I keep thinking it's like their farming like we would farm corn or tobacco, etc. I could be wrong and I didn't get the connection between the spice and the sandworms. Is it like a drug to them? I did read in the back of the book that is was like a drug when taken in small quantities and really addictive when taken in large quantities and that Muad'Did felt his prophesies were because of the spice. I liked Duke Leto and I hated that he was betrayed not long after they got to Arrakis. There is always some twat out there causing trouble. I really enjoyed Paul's character and his mother Jessica. They seemed like really strong people and adapted very well in everything they were put through. I didn't really pay too much attention to the other characters or I guess I should say I didn't have many thoughts about them. With the exception of the ones that betrayed them. I really enjoyed when Paul and Jessica had to travel to get away from the evil Baron Harkonnen before they were killed too. I don't know why, but I enjoyed their little journey. I think they were both great in their roles when they were found by the Freman and showed they were a force to be reckoned with. Now maybe I'm getting this all wrong but I'm trying to tell it through the way I saw it in my mind. I don't understand how Paul's sister, Alia, was an abomination. That one must have went over my head too. It might have had something to do with the poison Jessica took to become the Reverend Mother. I'm not sure but I know some of my goodreads friends that read this will get me sorted out =) Other than the sandworms and traitorous people on Arrakis, I was most freaked out by the thought of the water issue! I would NOT was to live somewhere there was a water shortage. And the part where they were talking about selling foot water, I can't even. Which basically means your stinky foot sweat! Anyhoo, I really loved the book! Mel 🖤🐶🐺🐾 ✅Thank you for the answers in my comments! 😊 MY BLOG: Melissa Martin's Reading List"

        "text":"Dune. No other single syllable means as much to the science fiction genre, a single word that conjures images of sandworms, spice wars, great battles between rival dynastic families and a massively detailed and intricately crafted universe. No wonder this is widely regarded as not just a Science Fiction masterpiece, but a literary achievement as well. Like a study of Shakespeare, the reader finds that this is an archetype upon which many influences and imitators have based their works. The complexity and depth of the creation is staggering and I am continually astounded at the discipline with which Herbert must have focused his imagination. This is the book upon which Herbert would base his greatest series and one that would outlive him as his son has continued to expand and add detail to the vast, immaculate tapestry woven by a true master of the genre. Encapsulating political, economic, sociological, biological, cultural and dynastic themes, Frank Herbert has set a high standard for later practitioners. Brilliant. ***2015 reread - Read years later, this has lost none of its narrative power, if anything I can better appreciate the virtuoso attention to detail Herbert exhibited in his epic creation. From the perspective of having read his later 5 Dune sequels, I am astounded at the rich tapestry he has woven. Most impressive was his close omnipresence, analyzing the thoughts and minute actions and subtle nuances of his complicated dynamic interplay of characters. The exhaustive training of the Bene Gesserit and the intricate relations of the Houses and the Guild would stand as a monumental benchmark for speculative fiction ever since. This time around I found myself looking more closely at the Harkonnens and will likely read some of Brian Herbert's additions to his fathers great work. ***2019 reread - I'm even more in love with this book and am again in awe of Herbert's narrative skill. This time around I noticed that all of the quotes that begin chapters are from Princess Irulan and I paid close attention to how Herbert crafted these interludes. I also was drawn to the religious undertones that really began very early in the book and how Paul realized his gifts and was preparing for his role in the beginning chapters - all demonstrating Herbert's great narrative skill. Finally, I became more aware of what a great character was Gurney Halleck. While the ghola of Duncan Idaho dominated the later books, Herbert's creation of Halleck was an enjoyable and thought provoking addition to this masterpiece. *** 2025 reread - This has lost nothing over the years and if nothing else, is even more potent now. I love that a new generation of fans, inspired by a very good adaptation are discovering Herbert's greatest work and for good reason, this is not only great science fiction, but good literature. Frank Herbert's prose is gifted and I am again amazed at the intricacy of his world building. There is foreshadowing within foreshadowing and his vision is something to behold."

        "text":"Let me start by first apologizing to everyone who loves this classic. I don't doubt Dune was something special when it first came out in the 1960s. But reading it for the first time today, it feels horribly outdated to me and at times almost incomprehensible. I was warned going into this story that the beginning is extremely hard to understand, but that is an understatement. I could barely follow its scene after scene of dialogue referencing people and places and events, all with no explanation or context. It literally feels like I was just dropped into the middle of a book, and everything had already been explained elsewhere. But it gets better, right? Well, only somewhat. A narrative does take shape, but the writing style remains confusing and obscure. It manages to be both long-winded and not clear enough, if you can believe that. Certain obvious points are harped on again and again, but other crucial ones are merely glossed over. Then, when you inevitably miss those important points, they create this cascading effect that keeps you mired in confusion. The writing is also pretentious, with regular or nonsensical things consistently being presented in a profound way. There are plenty of extraneous paragraphs that sound good until you try to discern their meaning, at which point you'd be stumped. This sort of writing really confused me because I couldn't figure out which paragraphs mattered and needed to be dissected carefully to suss out their hidden meaning, and which ones are just adornment. As for the story itself, it was a complete mismatch with my interests. I like science fiction with lots of real science. Instead, this is a space opera (a.k.a. a soap opera that takes place in space) with no actual science. It's all political intrigue, melodrama, doublespeak, and who has power over who, which I have zero interest in. I also couldn't care less about how fawningly amazing Paul is and how he is destined to be the chosen one. This was such a frustrating reading experience because it could've been an amazing story. And there were moments in the beginning when I thought it was going in those creative directions. I was riveted during that infamous test in the first scene, only to realize that it was completely irrelevant to the rest of the story. Or to see where the book could take the scientific aspects of a desert planet and a population with so little water, which it didn't other than a bit of lip service. But the book stubbornly chose to disregard these more interesting avenues, and instead took the most straightforward, boring route of making this into a story about power struggle. Well, we could've saved ourselves the bother and just stayed on Earth for that. ~~~~~~~~~~~~ ✧ Connect with me ✧ Instagram ✧"

        "text":"There's a characteristically witty essay by Borges about a man who rewrites Don Quixote , many centuries after Cervantes. He publishes a novel with the same title, containing the same words in the same order. But, as Borges shows you, the different cultural context means it's a completely new book! What was once trite and commonplace is now daring and new, and vice versa. It just happens to look like Cervantes's masterpiece. Similarly, imagine the man who was brave or stupid enough to rewrite Dune in the early 21st century. Like many people who grew up in the 60s and 70s, I read the book in my early teens. What an amazing story! Those kick-ass Fremen! All those cool, weird-sounding names and expressions they use! (They even have a useful glossary in the back). The disgusting, corrupt, slimy Harkonnens - don't you just love to hate them! When former-aristo-turned-desert-guerilla-fighter Paul Muad'Dib rides in on a sandworm at the end to fight the evil Baron and his vicious, cruel nephew, of course you're cheering for him. Who the hell wouldn't be? So that was the Dune we know and love, but the man who rewrote it now would get a rather different reception. Oh my God! These Fremen, who obviously speak Arabic , live on a desert planet which supplies the Universe with melange, a commodity essential to the Galactic economy, and in particular to transport. Not a very subtle way to say \"oil\"! They are tough, uncompromising fighters, who are quite happy to use suicide bombing as a tactic. They're led by a charismatic former rich kid (OK, we get who you mean), who inspires them to rise up against the corrupt, degenerate... um, does he mean Westerners? Or only the US? And who is Baron Harkonnen intended to be? I'm racking my brains... Dubya doesn't quite seem to fit, but surely he means someone ? Unless, of course, he's just a generic stereotype who stands for the immoral, sexually obsessed West. This is frightening. What did we do to make Frank al-Herbert hate us so much? You'd have people, not even necessarily right-wingers, appearing on TV to say that the book was dangerous, and should be banned: at the very least, it incites racial hatred, and openly encourages terrorism. But translations would sell brilliantly in Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, and a bad movie version would soon be made in Turkey. I honestly don't think Herbert meant any of that; but today, it's almost impossible not to wonder. If anyone reading this review is planning to rewrite The Tale of Benjamin Bunny , you'd better make sure you get your timing right. Who knows how it will be interpreted five years from now?"

        "text":"No one should argue the importance Dune . It laid the foundations for a great deal of the themes and constructs in modern science fiction. Frank Herbert was as important to the genre as Isaac Asimov and Arthur Clarke. Unfortunately, just like them, he's quite dated, and his books can be a labor to read. One thing he maintained from old science fiction was prim and scientific dialogue that no one would ever actually speak. I've known many scientists, and they don't talk like this. You're not going to convince me a child does. The stuffy dialogue is inserted into even stuffier narrative, until it feels like nothing is organic about Herbert's prose. This is a terrible tragedy when you've got a world that he put so much effort into building - and it is an amazing feat of world-building, technically interplanetary building. But unlike J.R.R. Tolkien, who he is so frequently compared to, Herbert didn't make sure to include a great story in his world. Instead he included a story that frequently illustrated how clunky an artificial world can be, even if it's lovingly crafted. I struggled to attach or find interest in anyone, yet they're more archetypes than human beings, whose logic races past modern skepticism and whose dialogue is cloyingly artificial, the way people cared for the Hobbits, Dwarves and Rangers. In his world-building, Tolkien at least saved himself from being dated by antedating himself, and even with his illuminated prose, wrought more characteristics in just one protagonist than all of Dune 's cast. Even the political intrigue Herbert tries to fall back on was overdone in the Spy genre decades before he started this book. All fans of the \"Genre\" genres should appreciate Herbert's massive contributions, but they shouldn't pretend to enjoy the books if they don't, and they should be wary of certain pitfalls typical of science fiction that survived into his landmark work."

First, the book is incredibly put together and really well thought out. Often, the author wrote the book in such a way as you can hear the character's thoughts which was a really interesting perspective and provided a more immersive experience. The book touches on so many different deep topics and is so inspiring, moving. The book was also so unpredictable and unique.

Even the plot couldn't save Dune, since it's spoiled at every juncture by 'Princess Irulan' and her epigraphs before each chapter. Did no-one tell her about spoiler alerts? From the very first pages, this book plunges you in at the deep-end with an absurd amount of overly complex world-building, which just makes the book laborious to work through. It wasn't for me, and the post-Dune reading slump is real."

Sure, it might be a bit too soon for her, but she DID insist because we'll be seeing Dune part 2 later this year. And she happens to know that I'm a rabid uberfan with no mercy or remorse. PLUS, I was able to read from my gorgeous new hardcover copy gifted to me by my best friend and that really does make all the difference, no? Update 9\/15\/21 Re-read. Number 14. I cannot get over how beautiful this book is. Still my favorite after all these years. It only gets better with every re-read. Update 8\/28\/17 Re-read. Number 13. :) I cry when Paul meets Gurney. I shiver when Jessica consoles Chani. I'm awestruck by the peaks and troughs of time, free-will, and the weakness in Paul even as he heroically strives against the evil that is about to be unleashed upon the universe. *sigh* Perfection. Easily the number one book I've ever read. :) I waver, sometimes, but right now, it is my absolute favorite. :) Original Review: This is a phenomenal classic of literature. It's not just science fiction. It transcends science fiction, as a fascinating discussion of free-will versus inevitability. Can the Jihad be denied? Can Paul ever really avoid his own death, despite seeing every time-line play out with him as the butt of every cosmic joke? Can even cruelty or mercy even remain comprehensible after such knowledge? Yes, I think this work outdoes Nietzsche. It certainly does a great job of making us care about the question. Is this all? Is this just a work that pays great justice to philosophy of action and inaction? Or is the novel merely a clever play at turning the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle into the physical embodiment of a man? It is that, of course. The Kwisatz Haderach can be many places at once, and he can be both alive and dead at the same time just like that certain cat. Is the novel a coming of age tale, first set as a mirror against his father Leto, only then to mirror the whole universe that had just turned against him? Yes, of course. He was, after all, both the product of all his upbringing and his genes, embodying the question of nature versus nurture. He was taught within many schools of martial arts and assassins, as well as training the mind in both the schools of the Mentats with their pure logic and that of the mystics, the Bene Gesserit, that allows complete control over the body down to the cellular level. And if this training wasn't enough, he was deeply schooled in politics, leadership, and the meaning of loyalty. The boy was raised right. Of course, that is nothing without ninety generations of genetic bloodline tampering from the Bene Gesserit, right? To become the fulcrum between cellular memory, tapping the minds and lives of all your genetic ancestors as well as tapping the ability to fold time and space, to become the eye of a storm of time. What a damn brilliant setup for one tiny character, no? His training links to the unlocking of his genes and to the life-extending and enveloping spice, Melange, to make him not merely aware of time in a theoretical sense, but eventually to be unable to discern what was in the past, the present, or the future. Here's a true Super-Man, well beyond Nietzsche. And don't believe for one second that this serious discussion about what would make a superior man makes for dull reading. No. We've got PLOT that's probably some of the most exciting and visceral in all of literature, driving us right into the web of intrigue, vengeance, treachery, and galactic politics. To quote the text, we've got \"Plans within Plans,\" and it hardly stops there. We know the House Atreides is falling into a trap laid by the Emperor and House Harkonnen, and yet free-will and pride prevents any chance to avoid it. The setup is brilliant and extremely political, giving us character sketches of some of the most brilliant and memorable characters of all time. Duke Leto, the Red Duke, the most honorable and beloved leader. Duncan Idaho, the emotional and intuitive hero. Gurney Halleck, archetypal loyalist and troubadour. Lady Jessica, the woman who ought to have had all honor in life, but was unjustly reviled and set aside for political necessity. (Chani being both her mirror and her eventual glory.) And of course, my favorite character of all time, Paul Muad'dib Atreides, the one that would prevent the greater evils he foresaw, and went to enormous lengths and sacrifice to achieve, but who eventually failed in his task because even a god cannot overcome destiny. (Or the will of so many minds set as one.) So damn brilliant. Frank Herbert spent five years writing this treasure, working and reworking it until he published it at age 25. None of his other works come close to this masterpiece, and there's little wonder. It was birthed, fully-formed, like Athena from Zeus's head, with enormous forethought and care. The worldbuilding was just as carefully formed, from the ecology of Arrakis and the life-cycles of the sandworms, to the history and the creation of the Fremen from their mild beginnings as Zensunni Wanderers, adherents to the Orange Catholic Bible, to their history of oppression so like those of those who are Jewish, to their settling and hardening of their bodies and souls in the wastes of Arrakis, also just like the Jewish who carved out a place for themselves in Israel. (Current politics aside, this was a very potent idea before 1965 when Herbert wrote this, and indeed, the core is still just as powerful when you turn it back to Muslims.) The Galactic culture is rich and detailed. The CHOAM economic consortium, with their monopoly on space travel and their need for the Spice to allow them to see a short period into the future to plot a safe course before folding space. The Empire is caught on a knife's edge between a single power and every other House who sit in the possibility of putting aside all their squabbles for the sole purpose of checking the Emperor, if they so desired. (And Duke Atreides was such a possible popular leader among all the Great Houses, which was the primary reason the Emperor wanted him dead.) And of course, we have our Villains. The Baron Harkonnen has always been a crowd pleaser. Brilliant in his own right, devious and able to corrupt anyone with just the right sorts of pressure, including a certain absolutely trustworthy doctor we might mention. \"The Tooth! The Tooth!\" -- You can't handle the Tooth! Feyd Rautha Harkonnen is especially interesting for the question of nature versus nurture. The Bene Gesserit had intended him to mate with Paul, who should have been Leto and Jessica's daughter, and that offspring should have been the cumulation of ninety years of a breeding experiment to recreate the Kwisatz Haderach which had come about almost by accident during the Butlerian Jihad in the deep past, to overthrow the AI overlords. He was practically Paul's genetic twin, or at least, his potential to be the \"One who can be many places at once\" was on par with Paul. But instead of fulfilling the kind of destiny that we get with Paul, we see him grow up under the auspices of his Uncle the Baron, becoming as cruel and devious as he was deadly. He was the argument of nurture in the conversation, of course, and having so very little of it eventually cost him his life. I often wonder about the directions that Dune could have taken, all those little paths in time and circumstance that could have been. What if Feyd had been brought to Arrakis earlier and overwhelmed with Spice the way that Paul had? Sure, he wouldn't have been able to convert the unconscious changes into conscious manipulation, but he might have had enough glimpses of the future, the way that the Fremen did, to have given him the edge he would have needed to kill Paul. And then there's a relatively minor character, Hasimir Fenring, the Emperor's personal assassin, who was nearly the Kwisatz Haderach, himself. Unable to breed true, he was still potent enough to be completely hidden to Paul's time-sight in the same way that Paul was hidden from the Spacing Guild's weaker time-sight. His training as a skilled killer was also superior to Paul. He was, by all the hints and tricks in the tale, Paul's perfect downfall. It always gives me shivers to think about, and it was only in a single instant of both recognition and pity from Paul that stayed Fenring from killing our hero. It was just a moment of whim. The setup was gorgeous. Paul's pity, had it been missing at his moment of greatest triumph over the Emperor, would have meant Paul's assured death. I still wonder, to this day, what stayed Frank Herbert's hand from killing his most wonderful darling. We knew the pressure of religion and politics was going to have its way upon all the oppressed peoples of Dune. The return of a monstrous religious Jihad was going to happen one way or another, sweeping across the galaxy and toppling the Empire, regardless of Paul's frantic plans and desires. Paul's own death would only mean a higher level of fanaticism, and Frank Herbert's warning against unreasoning devotion would have been made even clearer with Paul's death. Perhaps it was pity that stayed his hand. Who are we to say who lives and who dies? If you really think this review is overlong, then I apologize, but please understand that I could absolutely go on and on much longer than this. It is a symptom of my devotion to this most brilliant of all tales. And yes, it still holds up very, very well after twelve reads. I am quite shocked and amazed."

        "text":"Update 2 March 2024 I saw Dune 2 and the first one is nothing compared with it. Actually, most movies are nothing compared to Dune 2. Maybe Villeneuve is the real Kwisatz Haderach. Update! Just wanted to say how much I loved the movie. Go see it. It was probably good that there was a gap between the time I read this and the movie. Read 2015 Amazing! A masterpiece of SF with which I will probably compare all SF books that I’ll read in the future. It goes in my favorites shelf. This is my 3rd attempt to read Dune and I am really grateful that I did not succeed the first two times I tried as I was too young to understand all the subtleties. I would have probably enjoyed it as a very well written adventure novel but nothing more. That would have been a pity as Dune is so much more than a story about space travel and epic battles between good and evil. It presents complex philosophical ideas, explores ecological issues, cultural identity and differences. Also a major theme is represented by religion and religious leadership. The disturbing part about this book, taken in the current political context, is how easily the Fremen can be identified with an Arab nation. The spice can be seen as “oil” and the Harkonnens as evil westerners\/Russians that are exploiting the natural resources without thinking about the locals and the environment. I saw that others reviewers saw this as well."

        "text":"‘ Deep in the human unconscious is a pervasive need for a logical universe that makes sense. But the real universe is always one step beyond logic. ’ The sheer scope and magnitude of this 1965 sci-fi drama is staggering, populated with an extensive cast of characters and a rich universe full of well-rounded lore, intricate politics where every actions is revealed as ‘ plans within plans within plans, ’ and dynamic cultures all set on a collision course of plot that rightfully earned it a wide readership and canonization as a “Classic” work. I found it lived up to the hype and opened itself up more upon a reread, validating the fond memories I had of it from reading it first as a young teenager smitten with anything sci-fi. This book has zero chill and everything is to extreme and epic levels, including the size of worms. But come for the Bene Gesserits, best part. While there isn’t much to say that likely hasn’t already been said better, I still want to pause and reflect on some key elements in Dune . This is such a well-crafted book that addresses themes of power, religion, historical records as mythmaking and environmental concerns in a narrative about proxy wars and power struggles that speak just as loudly today as it did about 1960s foreign policy. If you are looking for a book of epic proportions, you can’t go wrong with Dune . The best part about this book, to me, is the way it is constantly expanding. There is great world-building and a rich lore that recalls my glee first exploring The Lord of the Rings , but what really excites me is the way Herbert reveals it all. The book starts so small—a visit to a cottage from an old woman that seems like such a small scale fairy tale on page one—and swiftly becomes gargantuan and never stops growing. It leaves you constantly feeling yourself shrink beside a universe always revealing itself as more complex than you had realized. I enjoy the way Herbert only gives you the minimum of what you need to understand and lets it all slowly unfold when necessary. ‘ They've a legend here, a prophecy, that a leader will come to them, child of a Bene Gesserit, to lead them to true freedom. It follows the familiar messiah pattern. ’ For newcomers, the basis of the book is that Paul has been quite literally bred to be a messiah and is engulfed in a difficult power struggle over a planet that essentially upholds the interplanetary economy through mining an addictive substance called “spice”. You might quickly find yourself thinking of spice as oil and the planet Arrakis as Middle East and Northern Africa (Tor put out a really great essay on the way Herbert engages with Muslim culture and traditions ), you know, since there was a whole Cold War going on at the time and giving the villain Baron Harkonnen a first name like Vladimir might make you wonder if this is all an elaborate metaphor. The Baron saying ‘ in politics, the tripod is the most unstable of all structures, ’ might make you think of the three branches of US government. You get the idea. There are also WWII holdovers present, such as the Sardaukar as an elite fighting force trained on Salusa Secundus to make sure you catch the S.S. reference. That’s all very much there, but this book is so much more than a simple sci fi rendition of the Cold War and Herbert definitely wants you to apply these themes to our larger political and religious global interactions. ‘ Fear is the mind-killer. ’ Another aspect I find fascinating in Dune is the depiction of Paul Atreides in the ‘chosen one’ trope. Paul has reservations, though not due to thinking he doesn’t deserve it (dude is royalty anyways, essentially) but because he fears what it will bring. Paul’s powers are enhanced through spice and he is able to perceive the future, and in almost every possible scenario he sees nothing but mass war in his name: ’ They were all caught up in the need of their race to renew its scattered inheritance, to cross and mingle and infuse their bloodlines in a great new pooling of genes. And the race knew only one sure way for this—the ancient way, the tried and certain way that rolled over everything in its path: jihad. ’ The notion of precognition brings free will into question, particularly when a certain individual appears in visions of the future but dies before it happens. It becomes a universe where individual free wills are all acting upon one another in an attempt to control the narrative of time. ’ And what [Paul] saw was a time nexus within this cave, a boiling of possibilities focused here, wherein the most minute action—a wink of an eye, a careless word, a misplaced grain of sand—moved a gigantic lever across the known universe. He saw violence with the outcome subject to so many variables that his slightest movement created vast shiftings in the pattern. ’ History is written by the winners, or so the saying goes, and much of this novel focuses on the way the narrative of time is constructed through the mythologizing of people and events. ‘ History will call us wives, ’ Jessica says to Chani, assuring her that her role as the lover to Paul will not be usurped by the princess he marries for the throne. Much of the book shows the dynamics between Paul as the Man and Paul as the myth, with characters like Stilgar recognizing that by being in service to the myth they too will be immortalized in the stories. Narratives become a form or power, and, as I’ll discuss soon, can be a form of control. Perhaps it is because power and control are so central to this novel that it feels so very timeless and just as applicable to 2021 as it did to 1965. In regards to power, leadership also becomes another key theme. ‘ Power and fear, ’ House Atreides Duke Leto says, ‘ The tools of statecraft, ’ a sentiment later echoed with all the same key terms by Baron Harkonnen. The two leaders are set up at the start as foils to each other, each trying to have their grip on Arrakis (there are some strong colonialism themes in this book and it delves into how troubling it is and how even those we might view as the savior turn out to be just another oppressor and colonizer) but their leaderships are defined by Leto’s rule through caring for his people while Harkonnen sees everyone as a useful pawn. ’ A leader, you see, is one of the things that distinguishes a mob from a people. He maintains the level of individuals. Too few individuals, and a people reverts to a mob. ’ Having recently finished The Dispossessed , I could have preferred some more voices in this book looking for better forms of ruling that don’t involve exploitation, but that’s not what this book is about so I’ll move on. What this book really focuses on is the ways power can be maintained, which crops up most in this novel through use of religion. ‘ But it's well known that repression makes a religion flourish, ’ we read, and the harsh life on Arrakis makes it the perfect setting where indoctrination of religion for the purpose of power can shape a community and unite them. Religion is a form of storytelling, having the people all believe in one shared story with all its myths and promises. ‘ You deliberately cultivated this air, this bravura, ’ Jessica instructs Paul, ‘ you never cease indoctrinating. ’ The stronger the shared faith, the more easily a leader can make them do what they need. It also helps that everyone is high as shit all the time. ‘ Religion and law among our masses must be one and the same, ’ Kynes's father says: ‘ An act of disobedience must be a sin and require religious penalties. This will have the dual benefit of bringing both greater obedience and greater bravery. We must depend not so much on the bravery of individuals, you see, as upon the bravery of a whole population. ’ Religion is being used constantly to shape the people for the purpose of their leaders, even in what seems an admirable purpose of turning desert Arrakis into a green paradise (and without a religious idea of paradise, how can a people who only know dry dirt and hardship even imagine a paradise?). ‘ The real wealth of a planet is in its landscape, how we take part in that basic source of civilization—agriculture. ’ This latter bit is also extremely key to Dune. The planet itself is practically a character in the novel, much in the ways the landscape is like a character in Westerns. The landscape of Arrakis truly shapes the people there, and we see a contrast between Arrakis and Caladan and how water as a precious resource on Arrakis changes many customs. Such as how spitting at a person is a sign of respect on Arrakis. Changing the environment on Arrakis is an interesting concept because, in order to make it thrive, what would the cost be? Would it disrupt spice, thereby collapsing the galaxy’s economy? Can these people ever be free, because doing so would require the complete dismantling of the governmental systems currently ruling? Can I try this spice? I would like to try the spice. There is also something to be said about the harshness of an environment being an ideal place for strenght in unity around a cause to crop up. Le Guin explores this in The Dispossessed as well, with the anarchist planet having a similar dry desert vibe as Arrakis and scarcity being a major player in what keeps the people bonded and working together. The Fremen are tough because of their environment, similiarly the Sardaukar are trained in extremely harsh environments as well. Dune plays a lot with ideas on how fascism and strongmen can quickly rise to power in times of economic instability—or the threat of it—and here the difficult planets tend to produce the most deadly fighters. Mix religion in and you have an instant army if you can convince everyone you are the chosen one. There is so much more to discuss in this book, particularly the Bene Gesserits and the Guild who are pulling a lot of strings, or just how friggen awesome the worms are. This is a big book with a lot of big ideas, and also a lot of ambiguity to them that I really appreciate. It is certainly a precursor for a lot of popular epics to follow. George Lucas certainly took notes and I imagine George R.R. Martin read this and said “wait, you can just kill beloved characters that easily!?” before rewriting Duke Leto as Ned Stark. While I can concede to those who find it boring and dry, I rather enjoyed all the history and lore and found this to be incredibly fun. 4.5\/5"

        "text":"People often forget that this series is what innovated our modern concept of science fiction (up until Neuromancer and The Martix, at least). Dune took the Space Opera and asked if it might be more than spandex, dildo-shaped rockets, and scantily-clad green women. Herbert created a vast and complex system of ancient spatial politics and peoples, then set them at one another's throats over land, money, and drugs. Dune is often said to relate to Sci Fi in the same way that Tolkien relates to Fantasy. I'd say that, as far as paradigm shift, this is widely true. Both entered genres generally filled with the odd, childish, and ridiculous and injected a literary sensibility which affected all subsequent authors. Few will challenge the importance of Star Wars' effect on film and storytelling in general, but without Dune, there would be no Star Wars. Princess Alia, the desert planet, the Spice, the Bene Gesserit, and Leto II all have direct descendants in the movies. It is unfortunate that Lucas seems to have forgotten in these later years that his best genius was pilfered from Herbert, Campbell, and Kurosawa. Though I have heard that the later books do not capture the same eclectic energy as the first, Dune itself is simply one of the most original and unusual pieces of Sci Fi ever written. Read it, Starship Troopers, Ringworld, Neuromancer, and Snowcrash and you'll know everything you need to about Sci Fi: that you want more."

Ohmygod look what that fake-looking piece of plastic shit is doing to poor MacLachlan's nose? How was he even able to act with that thing pushing his nostrils to the side of his face? I can't stop looking at it! Anyway. I remember loving that movie when I was young. Ahhhh. I honestly didn't remember much about it other than it was sorta weird, there were giant worms, a bunch of people had glowing blue eyes, and Sting was in it. After listening to this audiobook, I decided to rewatch the movie and relive the good times. Wow. Just wow . What in the holy hell did I just watch? Because whatever it was, it certainly didn't have much to do with the actual book. There were some fucking weird changes that they made to the movie that really didn't do anything for the plot. Like that gross dude with the shit in his face that flew around in that goofy air suit? In the book, he's just a fat dude! And that thing they do where they all have drain plugs attached to their hearts? Not in the book, either! In fact, none of that fucknut crazy\/gross sci-fi shit is in the book. Blowing shit up with their voice guns? Nope. Bald Bene Gesserits? Nope. Bugs with butthole mouths? Nope. Mentat's with clip-on eyebrows who drink juice that gives them herpes lips? Nope. Captain Jean-Luc Picard going into battle with a pug? Fuck no! The list goes on and on... Not that it should matter. But it does! Because I was expecting something realllyreallyreally different, and if you go into this (like me) you may end up...well, not disappointed but maybe shocked? Having said that, I think the book was definitely better. There was no reason for ass-mouth monsters or oily rock stars in weird rubber underwear. It just makes a lot more sense the way Herbert wrote it. It's a magic is science tale set in space with an incredibly interesting look at how politics and religion can hold hands with each other and make war babies. I can see why people rave about it. It's honestly an incredibly insightful novel. You know, if you're into that sort of thing... A little dense , but worth it. But dense. That's worth saying twice because this thing is massive and you may get lost in it if giant word monsters aren't your jam when it comes to reading. I listened to the Audible version which is 21 HOURS (and 2 minutes!) long and might be the way to go for anyone looking for the easy way out. And I am ALWAYS looking for the easy way out."

        "text":"“I have seen a friend become a worshiper, he thought.” I don’t think I actually *enjoyed* this book. But I certainly respected the hell out of it. For a bit I thought I had it all figured out, pegged it as your bog-standard Chosen One story, and then it went where I didn’t think it’d go and neatly subverted my expectations. It tackled stuff that is uncomfortable and therefore is generally handwaved over in the usual SF epics. And for that I seriously respected this dense complex tome. We people tend to love the idea of a charismatic all-powerful leader who inspires faithful following and true fervor, that cult-like blind devotion . We give those leaders tremendous power to lead and decide and determine fates. So many stories rooted in the weight of our species collective history glorify this; so many countries still apparently yearn for powerful visionary leaders that others proclaim to be dictators. So many religions go to wars over the legacy left by a popular charismatic leader centuries ago, interpreting those legacies as the engine for the action, destruction, obedience. Hero worship. Messianic worship. Prophecies and tyrannies. Desire for a Savior to rescue you from the evil. Good intentions paving the road to hell. It all leads to terrifying places which we may be powerless to stop. “A leader, you see, is one of the things that distinguishes a mob from a people. He maintains the level of individuals. Too few individuals, and a people reverts to a mob.” This is a novel of a reluctant Messiah, the journey of a man becoming the Chosen One — but unlike the traditional story of a charismatic savior, this is a darker picture of the dangers of messianism and hero worship, of allowing blind devotion replace common sense . The book ends in an ambiguous place, and I presume the sequels may develop the theme or run away from it and make this a more traditional hero journey. But I certainly hope not. Because the dark implications of messianism say more about human nature than the happier stories based on the same idea, but with more idealism . We love our ideas of ideal benevolent rulers who can set things right, don’t we? Or the martyr figures inspiring “righteous” battles? Messiahs and figureheads seem to fulfill the deep-seated cultural longing for an inspirational leader, don’t they? Friends become followers and worshippers, and the metaphorical slope becomes quite slippery . “The Fremen have a simple, practical religion,\" he said. \"Nothing about religion is simple,\" she warned. But Paul, seeing the clouded future that still hung over them, found himself swayed by anger. He could only say: \"Religion unifies our forces. It's our mystique.\" \"You deliberately cultivate this air, this bravura,\" she charged. \"You never cease indoctrinating.\" \"Thus you yourself taught me,\" he said.” Yes, in Dune Frank Herbert hints at the dangers present in such ideas. What seems like your traditional hero’s journey turns out darker and more sinister. But it’s not the rise of an antihero either. It’s subtler than that, without actually being all that subtle. “No more terrible disaster could befall your people than for them to fall into the hands of a Hero,\" his father said. Paul Atreides, in his own words, is “something unexpected.” A son of a planetary Duke (because an interstellar post-technology future is actually feudal) and a highly trained Bene-Gesserit concubine of the Duke (basically a member of the order\/Sisterhood of superpowered highly trained mind ninjas with strong political worlds-changing ambitions and generations-long breeding experiments aimed at creation of a controllable superhero) , Paul fits very well the idea of a Messiah of the tribal resilient society of Fremen people of the harsh desert planet Arrakis , neatly fulfilling their religious prophecies (that may have been stealthily planted before by the above-mentioned supernatural ninja order) and possessing genetic superpowers himself, augmented by rigorous training and catalyzed by the ingestion of a magical wonder-drug known as spice . “He found that he no longer could hate the Bene Gesserit or the Emperor or even the Harkonnens. They were all caught up in the need of their race to renew its scattered inheritance, to cross and mingle and infuse their bloodlines in a great new pooling of genes. And the race knew only one sure way for this—the ancient way, the tried and certain way that rolled over everything in its path: jihad.” But Paul through his prescient powers can see what his mythologized destiny leads to. A galactic scale slaughter led by fanatics in his name. And there is not a way to escape it, once your life fits the mysticism of their faith (even if the faith and prophecies were stealthily prereplanted for sort of a similar purpose). Religious fanatics are destined to wage a brutal war that the Messiah is unable to stop. “When law and duty are one, united by religion, you never become fully conscious, fully aware of yourself. You are always a little less than an individual.” With great power comes great responsibility, and all that jazz. But is any of it actually worth it? Wouldn’t the world be better without the burden of Heroes? Are you destined to become exactly what you’re trying to avoid? All this is gently hinted at, laid out in the framework of the appealing Hero’s journey. It seems that should you desire, you can still easily choose to read it as a typical hero’s\/antihero’s story, just less idealistic than it could be. But that would be Star Wars and not Dune . “He was warrior and mystic, ogre and saint, the fox and the innocent, chivalrous, ruthless, less than a god, more than a man. There is no measuring Muad'Dib's motives by ordinary standards. In the moment of his triumph, he saw the death prepared for him, yet he accepted the treachery. Can you say he did this out of a sense of justice? Whose justice, then? Remember, we speak now of the Muad'Dib who ordered battle drums made from his enemies' skins, the Muad'Dib who denied the conventions of his ducal past with a wave of the hand, saying merely: \"I am the Kwisatz Haderach. That is reason enough.” And you also can’t help but be mesmerized by a harsh desiccated planet where life is focused on survival, where not even water but mere moisture is the most coveted and rarest thing, where hopes for a better, wetter, greener future quietly flourish, tied into messianic ideas but grounded in science. The place of nightmares, written vividly and skillfully, making me want to gulp down a gallon of drink just because I can, making me appreciate that my reality doesn’t hinge on surviving on my reclaimed bodily fluids. The world is harsh, unforgiving, brutal, hostile. The characters - well, mostly Paul, but to an extent his mother Jessica as well - are cold, calculating, composed and often very unsympathetic. Paul’s father values lives over property. Paul’s actions, on the other hand, lead to eyebrow-raising among his father’s old lieutenants who note the difference in priorities: “Nothing money won't repair, I presume,\" Paul said. \"Except for the lives, m'Lord,\" Gurney said, and there was a tone of reproach in his voice as though to say: \"When did an Atreides worry first about things when people were at stake?” It’s dense and complex, full of politics, short on actual science fiction but full of ruminations on human nature — and it leaves me feeling that all of this is a beginning of another cycle of violence, just with a new figurehead at the mast. As Terry Pratchett said, “But here's some advice, boy. Don't put your trust in revolutions. They always come around again. That's why they're called revolutions.” A new Hero or a new Messiah comes, and begets another cycle or struggle and violence, to be reset anew by a new figurehead sometimes in the future . All while sandworms quietly slither under the sand. ————— Oh yeah, there are sandworms, too. ————— 4 stars out of respect for Herbert’s subversive story that made me think. I’m content with the story ending here, with ambiguity and dread for what’s to come.[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>"

        "text":"Why You Should Read Dune (video): https:\/\/youtu.be\/oOomSvGXfaM Asking me to describe why Dune is so important to me is like asking a child to explain nuclear fusion. I do my best in the video linked above, but just know it probably isn't for the reasons you think. My journey to Dune becoming my absolute favorite book of all time goes all the way back to the mid-1990's upon finding it in my high school library and deciding to give it a try because I remembered my dad and brother watching the movie when I was a kid. At 15 years old, I got to the middle of \"book II\" and gave it a big fat DNF. I decided it just wasn't for me. At 17, for the 30th anniversary, I decided to try again and while I finished it that time, I thought the ideas were overly pretentious and way too out there. But a year went by and somehow, it was still in my head. I thought about it frequently and I began to ponder...did I actually really like it? I tried again the final weeks of my senior year of high school and became absolutely obsessed and it has stayed that way for almost the last 25 years. Dune is social science-fiction in that it's more concerned with the people and society than it is with hard science. Besides telling you that these navigators \"fold space\" for interstellar travel, Herbert doesn't bog you down with the math. He focuses more on the politics, cultures, religion, and philosophies of a world rich in the most valuable resource in the known universe, but barren in everything else. If you go into the story expecting a Star Wars style adventure, you're going to leave disappointed. Dune is extremely thought provoking and deals with the struggles of coming of age while the fate of the universe is on your shoulders. I'll also say that the book is certainly not for everyone. If you love things like ASOIAF and The Wheel of Time, there is no way this book won't be for you as both of those series borrowed heavily from the story Frank crafted. But I think it truly depends on where you are at in your life. Look, I just told you the story of how it took until my third reading for this to really click with me. Those who the story and lessons click with, it REALLY clicks with. But, again, this isn't a crowd pleaser and not everyone is going to love it, especially modern readers. So while I encourage those that are interested to read it, I expect more modern readers to not like it than like it. Not only is this the greatest science-fiction story of all time, but I believe it should be on mandatory reading lists in schools and everyone interested in the genre owe it to themselves to read the pillar of the genre they have come to love. Dune is every bit to science-fiction what Lord of the Rings is to fantasy."

        "text":"2021 Reread - 5* I was totally blown away by the recent movie version of this, that much so I decided to revisit and revaluate my opinion of this extraordinary book. So, I read it again six years on and this is something I said I would never do because I found it so difficult to read the first time. It wasn’t the complexity of the world and politics, but the narration style which totally perplexed and frustrated me. Though I think that was more to do with my immaturity as a reader at the time than anything else. This is a difficult one, but it’s worth it. This time I was impressed with everything: the intelligence of the writing, the details of the world and the intricate nature of the storytelling. There’s just so much brilliance here. And it’s entertaining. It’s interesting. The balance is perfect. The Freman culture is driven by ideas of ecology, efficiency and waste reduction. And whilst they are not without their faults, the sense of oneness and appreciation they have for their home planet is a strikingly important commodity. I found them fascinating to read about and of the many thing this novel has going for it, they are the jewel in Herbert’s crown. I want to see more of this world. Original Review (2015) - 3.5* I could never give Dune five stars because I really struggled to get into the novel in the beginning. It has taken me almost two months to read. This, for me, is a very long time to spend on a book. It took me so long to read because I found the writing style incredibly frustrating. I had to read whole chapters again so I could get the gist of the plot. This was more so in the beginning, which I found particularly hard to read because of the author’s way of shifting between the thoughts of multiple characters. I found this very annoying; however, I persevered over my initial despondency towards the writing, and plodded on through the book. I’m glad I did so because in the end I did come to really enjoy it. Indeed, the story is fantastic, but the writing will always remain unbearable for me. A truly brilliant plot Dune is to science fiction what The Lord of the Rings is to high fantasy; it is the novel that officially, and unarguably, defines the genre. The story begins with the house of Atreides accepting the Dukedom of the planet Dune. The former Baron has been ousted by the Emperor, and is no longer of consequence. Well, that is how it initially appears. Very early on it revealed that the whole thing is a political ploy to bring the house of Atreides to its knees. The Baron lies in wait, and is ready to strike against the new, and benevolent, approach the Duke uses on the Fremen. The Fremen are the natives of the dessert planet; thus, they know how to survive its harshness above all others. They do this through their frugal approach to water. They value it above all else, and will never waste a drop in earnest. The Baron Harkonnen, as a chide against the natives, squanders water in the cruellest ways. He, and his dinner guests, throw cups of water on the floor of the dinner hall; it was his tradition. The wasted water was soaked up with towels, which the Baron allowed the Fremen to suck the water out of. When the Duke enters he rejects this custom, and is more respectful to the Fremen way of life. He and his son and heir Paul, who is the protagonist of this novel, go as far as to try the Fremen’s grossly effective water saving suits. These Stillsuits, quite literally, recycle all the water the body wastes and feeds it back to its wearer. The Fremen way is the right way This early familiarity, with the Fremen technology, no doubt helps to keep Paul’s mind open when he is later forced to live amongst the Fremen. Paul is somewhat of a marvel; he is prophecy’s chosen one. When he eventually gains the trust of the Fremen they allow him to choose a Fermen name. He calls himself after their most revered prophet: Muad'Dib. They accept this and follow him as their leader. His inherited title of Duke dictates that he is their lord, but their religion determines their real loyalty. He has to, quite literally, fight for every ounce of their trust. Indeed, it does not come cheap, and will only be given to one who is a member of their people. “Without change something sleeps inside us, and seldom awakens. The sleeper must awaken.” Thus, Paul becomes their saviour. Consequently, he receives heaps of character development through this book. He goes form boy to the revered leader of a nation. The Fremen, like Paul, want the evil Baron Harkonnen gone from their planet. They do no want a cruel oppressor who is ignorant to their ways: they want Paul. I think the imagination behind the Fremen culture really is wonderful. They have efficiently adapted to survive their harsh planet. To emphasise this point you need only look at the fact that off-world humans live in fear of the giant Sandworms that infect the planet whereas the Fremen ride them as a coming of age ritual. Indeed, Paul has to ride a worm if the Fremen are to follow him. Deep characters The result of this is a very complex, and intriguing plot. I found the first third of this book to be very perplexing initially. This is a world we are told about rather than shown at the start. We hear about the Fremen but do not truly understand them till the very end. I was very overwhelmed at the beginning, and in all honesty I do think this novel merits a re-read to further establish my understanding of it. This did affect my rating because it inhibited by enjoyment of the book. “Deep in the human unconscious is a pervasive need for a logical universe that makes sense. But the real universe is always one step beyond logic.” Indeed, aside from Paul there is a whole host of dynamic, and well rounded, characters. His mother is to be the new revered mother of the Fremen people, which for someone of her age is quite remarkable. There is also the captain of Duke Leto’s household guard who is a very deep and honourable individual. As much as I came to like these characters I was still frustrated with the writing of them in the beginning. I found it difficult to read scenes in which up to four characters internal thoughts are portrayed alongside their dialogue. It wasn’t always clear who was thinking. I much prefer a narrative that is focalised through one person. Well, at least one person per chapter. Overall, I thought the idea behind this novel was utterly fantastic. However, my personal reaction to the writing style limited my overall enjoyment of the book. I do intend to read some of the sequels. However, I do not have any intention of doing so in the near future. Maybe, in a couple of years I will return to the brilliant, and annoyingly written, world of Dune. __________________________________ You can connect with me on social media via My Linktree . __________________________________"

        "text":"Seems as if they might be duned to be addicted to spice, all good old barbarians on magic mushrooms style. Quite dusty, especially regarding how to put the different parts of this behemoth series in the big picture of sci-fi because each part (of the 3 I´ve read so far and very probably won´t restart trying to read the 4th and 5th part) presents something different. Essentially, only this, the first one, is a real science fantasy epos, while the others are mostly circulating around the characters' special skills and family problems without much meta, plot, or different settings. Just this first milestone is big in the epic worldbuilding department and some other things I´ll try to point my primate fingers at. As unrealistic as water scarcity in such a highly developed galactic civilization seems, it´s a perfect explanation for creating the blue eyed mind mutants and the misandrist female breeding gang, that don´t ever need to kick male butts, because they preemptively avoid that situation to become real. Real life implications and innuendos. I don´t know if Herbert had any kind of real civilizations, cultures, or traditions in mind when he constructed the tribes, today it would probably fall under any kind of politically correct bigoted do gooder codex, but there could lie a ton of creative writing gold in exploring this question of how to implement any past or present movement, society, tradition, faith into different sci-fi subgenres. Because how the traditions, monsters, and badass special moves of the inhabitants influence the planetary and intergalactic trade and travel balance is slowly presented to the reader, while the impact of the wonderful spice expands its glow towards total domination. Don´t take drugs except they make you superhuman As so often, a prescription free pharmaceutical wonder cure can solve all of your problems until corporate interests come and ruin everything by using anything in their armory to get control over the precious resource of psychohistoric psi precognition power. The idea of one substance changing the whole balance of power of the galaxy is big in many sci-fi series and especially terrifying for each arrogant, high tech civilization, because an animal creating impervious shields, an immortality tonic, a mind altering super drug, etc., could enable far weaker, steampunky tribes to destroy them. Classic barbarian hordes on magic mushrooms looting Rome style. Bene Gesserit Who says that centuries long, epigenetic, elitist breeding programs have to be completely evil all the time? Except for the poor lovers aroused by the wrong, not arranged partner, stupid Romeo and Juliet syndrome complexes, you have to see the bigger picture and control your hormones and feelings and sacrifice some biochemical illusions to create the ÜberPsi mentat mentalist mind penetrator. However, it works with less evil too. Together with the spice, this elite mental mind control academy with the aim to finally create the ultimate space JC messiah figure to defecate rainbows, freaking galactic peace, pink unicorns, and gold, is the backbone of the whole trilogy, because impacts of both and the excessive use of it as MacGuffins and Chekhovs plot devices lead to the question: Is this still really sci-fi or not more a high fantasy thing with some sci-fi elements? Well, highly subjectively, yes, Dune is mostly psi fantasy dressed in futuristic clothes with some faith, tech, technobabble (rare), and trade in between, which makes it one of the most outstanding and unusual sci-fi works, I mean fantasy camouflaged as sci-fi. Tricky, one is so indoctrinated to call this thing sci-fi that it took me a reread and absorbing many reviews to realize what´s really going on. I´m really not sure about this whole thing, I´ve read a ton of sci-fi and my alien mind parasite, in a kind of perverted symbiosis with the xenovirus making me look fresher I deliberately bought for this purpose like a tapeworm therapy to lose weight (you don´t want to know what this costs on the alien bioweapons black market, the second half of my immortal soul exactly), tells me that there still would a lot of story without the sci-fi elements, while close to nothing would be there after removing fantasy, faith, drugs, and mind penetrating abilities, so, yea. I mean, even the planet itself doesn´t really has sci-fi fractions or something, the space around it is kind of empty without many sci-fi parties, cyborgs, aliens, everything substantial seen in close to any big sci-fi series. This leads me to An unpopular and possibly controversial opinion It could be that Herbert is, and I am just talking about the sci-fi aspect, a bit overrated or, let´s precisely define it, overhyped as a sci-fi author because he is more of a fantasy writer. This couldn´t happen in a fantasy world, because parts of the legions of readers of the genre don´t want aliens and Clarketech mixed in their magic, not to speak of the suspension of disbelief problem that often comes with sudden future tech elements in fantasy, that´s just disgusting. The other way round, as with Dune, is much easier, just put some sci-fi around fantasy and everything just rolls perfectly. Is terraforming destroying cultural heritage or making inhabitable worlds paradises? The ethical implications of this question are another sci-fi old school vehicle, especially if the terrible acid rain, high gravity, parasite infested, or dirty desert land is the only region where the special, red plotline device can grow and thrive. One could go so far as to ask if there are real life examples on earth, conservation vs corporate environmentalism, greenwashing and stuff (spoiler warning: conservation lost, earth is dying), and how this should be dealt with in decades, centuries, or millennia when we (I hope you are immortal too thanks to alien symbiont virus cooperation like me, if you aren´t, poor you, may I infect you? Just 20.000 of whatever your fringe financial system uses as fiat money that will be worthless as soon as natural apocalypse, mutually assured destruction, or alien invasion make it obsolete, and you get the parcel. Shipping not included.) start manipulating weather, geophysics and- chemistry, and climate of other worlds to make it sexy, tropical, tourist friendly paradises at the low cost of exterminating all alien life, but this would be a bit far fetched. Herberts´place in the sci-fi or sci-fa hall of fame. That´s tricky, especially because he just couldn´t keep delivering after the third part. I´ve played around with the fourth and fifth part, but had to abandon it because it escalated to too much unmotivated, philosophical drivel without a real plotline and a place in the big picture of the series, Herbert just didn´t manage to hold it all together. What made the first three parts, that they are kind of eccentric, ingenious standalones without the classic space opera series uniting plotline and style, great, kind of destroyed the rest of the series. Because he had no more vision for the meta, high sci fa elements, Herbert lost control over his own creation and just manufactured hearthless shells to sell more books. But that doesn´t mean that the first three parts aren´t milestones of the interdisciplinary genre, exploring it in new ways no one imagined before while reaching Lem-, Clarke-, and Asimov levels of subtle, intelligent dialogues, innuendos, connotations, and character driven development. It´s something unique, special, and definitively not for anyone because of its high entry barriers that may annoy some readers, but don´t let yourself be easily deterred by that, it´s totally worth it once you´re in and high as heck and addicted forever to the wonderful, delicious spice melange.

        "text":"Dune is often considered a masterpiece of 20th-century American science fiction. In part, the book owes its reputation to the film adaptation David Lynch directed in the early 1980s (although this movie was, and still is, not considered one of his best). Frank Herbert wrote a novel of epic proportions, in other words, a space opera , with its intergalactic feudal society, its decadent (if not evil) empire and its band of rebels: the book was published some ten years before the first instalment of the Star Wars series. Indeed, along with Asimov’s (overrated) Foundation stories, it was George Lucas’ primary source of inspiration. One of the most exciting aspects of Herbert’s creation is the multi-cultural world he depicts. Each house (Atreides, Harkonnen, etc.), each planet (Arrakis, Giedi Prime, Caladan...), each group (the Fremen, the Bene Gesserit, the Guild, the Emperor’s suite and the Sardaukars) has its specific flavour, its own culture, its language — the comprehensive index at the end of the book is utterly fascinating. For each of these cultures, Herbert borrowed traits from traditions (ancient or contemporary) he knew well in reality, especially from the Middle East. In particular, Paul Atreides \/ Muad’Dib’s story among the Fremen is redolent of the historical events around T.E. Lawrence and the Arab revolt against the Ottoman Empire. And Paul’s crusade on Arrakis is told, as though it were ancient history, in the chronicles by the Princess Irulan at the start of each chapter. Herbert describes his fictional world and characters in great detail, which contributes to the richness of his narrative, but I found these descriptions somewhat boring and, especially, the middle of the book is a bit dragging for that reason. In my view, the most impressive parts of this novel are the dialogues, where Herbert simultaneously reveals what the characters are saying and thinking. This technique lends a sense of duplicity and scheming to almost every interaction. Everyone is plotting one way or another so that the whole thing ends up being like a great Shakespearean play, with dialogues and asides, tyrants and pretenders. What confirms this impression is not only the theme of the exiled Duke (see As You Like It , King Lear , or The Tempest ), but also the repeated scenes of fencing duels throughout, with feints and poisoned tips: a clear allusion to the endings of Hamlet and Macbeth , for instance. Edit : A word about Denis Villeneuve’s new film adaptation of Herbert’s novel (part 1, 2021). Comparisons are odious and obviously wouldn’t be to David Lynch’s advantage. This is a Dune version for a new generation of fans and an epic movie on par with Peter Jackson’s Lord of the Rings trilogy, in the early 2000s. The settings (filmed in Scandinavia and the Middle East) are breathtaking, and the actors have so much going for them. But what strikes me the most in this new version is the sense that everything is overwhelming and sublime: the massive architecture, the crushing machines, the extreme weather conditions, the earth-shattering landscapes, the thunderous music, the tragic events, the repulsive foes. From the relenting waves of Caladan to the searing and unending skies of Arrakis, everything assumes an oceanic and staggering dimension."

        "text":"I blame the movie. I was an avid but novice fantasy and sci-fi reader in 1984 when David Lynch’s Dune rolled out as a big-budget adaptation of the 1965 classic book. It was an artistic and box-office failure with Roger Ebert calling it “a real mess, an incomprehensible, ugly, unstructured, pointless excursion.” Numerous references were made to its excessive length, particularly a tv edition that was over 3 hours long. I never did pick up the classic sci-fi book, assuming the commentary heard about the movie applied to the book. All that changed when I broke my finger and found myself with a lot of extra time on my hands (groan). Besides, sandworms. Dune has a lot of ingredients that don’t fit into my preferred stories, yet the gestalt was not only tolerable, but engrossing. It begins with the Atreides family preparing to shift their holding from their current home to the planet of Arrakis. The Emperor has given the Atreides the territory and trade on the planet of Arrakis, formerly under control of their enemies, the Harkonnen. The planet Arrakis is hot, arid and generally hostile to life. There is, however, a small population of native, fierce Freman who have managed to build an existence in the desert. Paul Atreides is the young heir of the family, and mystical testing reveals he might be the one prophesied. Paul undergroes a rapid growth curve, facilitated by his teacher Dr. Yeuh and his father’s advisors. But it is in the desert that Paul will discover his strength as well as his new people. Seriously, now. Honestly, I have to wonder how much of this like is generational. If Sanderson or Rothfuss wrote this book, two chapters in Dune would have made a whole book, and while detail may have been added, it likely would have made for a book as slow as the movie. I liked the scope of Dune, and that there is a resolution to the initial conflict. It is also interesting that despite the volume of concepts packed in here, with political maneuvers, terraforming, technology, cultural assimilation, and mysticism all playing roles that I didn’t find it overwhelming, perhaps because so much is genre-familiar. On the downside, it could have perhaps used a bit more transitions, particularly near the end when months at a time are skipped. Writing was solid; nothing really stood out, but it told the story well. There’s some vague mysticism that might irritate those who like explanations. It was a bit of an eye-roller to have the chief villain be a fat, gay, sadistic pedophile, but Herbert really isn’t thinking outside the trope character box much (it’s not enough that he sentences people to death but he has to be physically abhorrent? And gay?). World-building is fun, but standard desert. Overall, I’m glad that I finally took the time to read it and put those old assumptions to rest. I love a good hero."

        "text":"3.5\/5 Stars Dune oh Dune, seems like I need to raise my Shield Wall for this review. Dune is one of the most important pieces of literature for the Sci-Fi genre. I’ve been raking my brain for hours on how to properly explain the importance of Dune in the sci-fi literature but you know what? I dune (hehehe) think it’s necessary for me to do so. If you truly wanna know why, you can search it on whatever search engine you use and you'll find hundreds of articles or reviews on why this book is that important; and they’ll do a much better job than me. I won’t even deny any of them because, in my opinion, this book was truly revolutionary. Dune didn’t become the number one highest selling Sci-fi novel of all time for no reason; like Brian Herbert said, it is to Sci-Fi, what the LOTR trilogy is to fantasy. Theoretically, if I’m reviewing this by putting my head as someone from 1960’s or 1970’s, I know I would think of this book as my bible. 1965 was the year when Dune was published for the first time, 24 years before I was born. There are just too many groundbreaking ideas, world-building, that would become the inspirations for many Sci-fi in our time; I only realized this after reading this book. I mean, the gigantic Sandworm alone has inspired many video games to use it as a common monster or enemy. Picture: Dune by Marc Simonetti Desert planet, Stillsuits, space exploration, and Zen Buddhism, Dune was truly a groundbreaking novel, almost everything in this book somehow seems prophetic because it has predicted our current society, especially when it comes to faith, emotional control, empathy, and the importance of ecology and scarcity. “The mind commands the body and it obeys. The mind orders itself and meets resistance.” Part of what made this book was great for me was Herbert’s prose. I haven’t read enough classic to claim it was classical, but Herbert’s prose was definitely unique to me. It has a lot of freedom by writing it from a limited omniscient narrative; changing POV’s repeatedly in a single chapter without any warning. This is, honestly, one of my biggest pet peeves in my usual read, but Herbert made it work because all his characters were really well written, distinct in their personality, and the dialogues are really well dune (HEHEHE). Plus, there are so many motivational and extremely philosophical quotes that seem to make this book a combination of Sci-Fi & self-help book, such as: “It is so shocking to find out how many people do not believe that they can learn, and how many more believe learning to be difficult.” And of course, the most famous and one of the best quote I’ve ever read out of any book “I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.” I can’t believe I have gone through life without knowing about this litany against fear. It’s applicable in any kind of hardship we faced in real life, and I know it will be one of my motto starting from now. If I’m judging this book solely from how significant this book was, I’ll give it maximum score in a heartbeat. However, I’m reviewing this based on one question and how I rated all the books I read: was it enjoyable? The answer is yes and no, it was a mixed bag. The first part of this book was incredible, I couldn’t put down the book and everything was so interesting and compelling. Then comes the second part, where the pacing just became really draggy and somehow, boring. However, my hope was restored for a while during the third act, until the anti-climax happened. My expectation is obviously at fault here but hey, this book is the number one highest selling sci-fi book of all time and one of the most highly acclaimed book, I expected there to be a mind-blowing climax sequences to close the book in an epic way. But no, there wasn’t any. Not only it felt anti-climactic, Herbert’s prose in describing settings and actions didn’t age well or up to current standard. The main reason for this is that this is a book that relies heavily on character’s dialogues to do everything; world-building, plot, characterizations were done solely through dialogues. This leads to the great plot but weak action sequences and no vivid settings. Sure there was some explanation on the settings, but other than the planet—which is just a desert, just search Sahara or Planet Tatooine and voila—the interiors were given only brief description, which makes it hard to imagine; I had to look up some artworks to be able to immerse myself in the settings of the book. Overall, Dune was truly a revolutionary book for its time that is filled with tons of imaginative and fantastic ideas. Although there were some parts that disappointed me, I still liked the book and I finally understand why there are so much discussion and praises around this book. I recommend this to every Sci-fi fans for its importance and also, it’s good to know where most fantastic Sci-Fi you’ve read or you’re reading now got its idea from. However, this is also where I’ll stop with the series. You can find this and the rest of my Adult Epic\/High Fantasy & Sci-Fi reviews at BookNest"

        "text":"[UPDATED] I reread Dune for the first time in several decades and immensely enjoyed it. I also went back to watch the original cult feature film by David Lynch and had quite mixed feelings - while it was close to the overall aesthetic that Frank Herbert describes with the gorgeous desert sets and the terrifying worms, the parts of the story that were necessarily culled out was disturbing (that and the woeful special effects at the time trying (and IMHO failing) to visualize the personal shields that the characters wear in hand-to-hand combat). For those who are just discovering Dune for the first time, it is essentially a messianic story on a desert planet (think of Jesus or perhaps Mohammed on Tatooine) in a universe dominated by a cartel (the Guild also known as CHOAM) with a monopoly on a drug (called mélange) derived from a rare material (spice) available only on the desert planet Arrakis (Dune). This drug is so powerful that it allows the Guild (and later Maud'dib) to leverage space-time singularities to defy the speed of light and travel anywhere in the universe. Overlaid on this foundation, the epic battle of the feudal houses of the noble Atreides and the evil Harkkonen houses rages, the betrayal of the former by the latter explicitly endorsed by the Emperor (himself an almost impuissant pawn of the Guild as well). All that to say that the fabric of the story is multilayered and as complex and complete a universe as you will find in George RR Martin or Dan Simmons. There are several enhanced human species running around: the Mentats who have been cerebrally enhanced to be able to calculate like supercomputers (computers themselves having been banned!) and each then uses their predictive analytics for their assigned Dukes (or the Emperor) and the Bene Gesserit cult who are a sort of quasi-religious non-celibate nuns who have honed perception and language to the point of having developed nearly superpower-level strengths of persuasion which are almost universally feared and vilified as sorcery in the rest of the universe. Paul Atreides, heir to the throne, is born to Jessica, a Bene Gesserit, possessed some of these powers and when the family moves to Arrakis (part of the aforementioned Harkkonen plot) from their home planet Caladon, he appears to the native Freeman population as perhaps a fulfillment of their messianic prophecies and hopes. In perhaps the most critical departure from the book, the Lynch movie does not really show Paul questioning the awesome power that he possesses and his assumption of the mantle as the Arrakis Messiah, the Maud'dib (something that the 2021 film by Denis Villeneuve does thankfully address). In the book, one aspect that I loved was how Paul struggled with this messianic destiny and did everything he could to subvert it. One of the unique gifts he received, presumably as the rare and unique offspring of a Bene Gesserit, was the ability to see possible outcomes (like a Mentat) and thus he could take decisions based on the most likely foreseen outcome. It made for great reading. The other great thing about Dune is the aesthetic of this desert planet with impossibly huge worms under the surface who are mysteriously connected to spice and pose a danger to all creatures in the desert except for the Freeman. The still suit which recycles body water in the deep desert was brilliant as was the ever-present obsession with \"water debt\" of the Freemen. I really felt like I was walking unevenly (must not attract the worms!) through the sand with Jessica and Paul before their fateful encounter with the Freemen. Dune is a well-deserved classic for all the reasons I mentioned above and probably much more that I missed. I have read it twice and gotten almost entirely different things out of it each time. I have since read all the canonical Frank Herbert books in the series and enjoyed it all immensely. [UPDATE] I am looking forward to Denis Villeneuve's Dune in October 2021. The previews I have seen so far seem to be quite coherent with respect to the book. I was a fan of Lynch's Dune and am curious to see what Villeneuve does with this one. Feel free to comment below. [UPDATE] Villeneuve’s 2021 film covers half of the book and does a fantastic job as both an homage to Herbert’s book and Lynch’s film. The casting, costumes, CGI, and script are all top-notch. Dune lovers have every reason here for rejoicing. One key difference from the Lynch film is that we do not see the Guild Navigators, so we can hope that they show up in the second half! [UPDATE 2024] I loved the 2nd DV adaptation especially the use of color and black and white as well as character arcs. There were a few deviations from the original, but nothing as idiosyncratic as Lynch’s rain on Arakis In 1984. I can’t wait to see what he does with Dune Messiah.

        "text":"3.5\/5 Honestly, I never know exactly how to start my review after finishing a nearly nine hundred pages book, but I guess I'll start by saying that I definitely enjoyed it, but was it a life-changing reading experience? Unfortunately, not for me. This book is considered a classic of the science fiction genre, Frank Herbert did an amazing, or even one of a kind job, creating the entire universe in which Dune takes place, all the characters, descriptions and practically everything in this book was simply fascinating. I really wanted to be one of those people who closes this book and is completely in love with it, and then when someone asks if they've read it say \"Yeah, I love Dune, it's my favorite book.\" but as it turns out, I'm not that person. At least, yet. This is the first story in a six-volume series, so I hope that changes. Like I said, I liked it, but I genuinely think I would have loved it if I hadn't watched the movies. In my opinion, the movies are even a close-to-being-perfect adaptation of the Herbert’s work and pretty much everything that happened in the book also happened in the first two films - with some small changes and a few scenes were in a different order, but it didn't change the fact that I still very much enjoyed watching both of them. Dune I and Dune II, being great adaptations, unfortunately meant that watching them before reading the book wasn't the best idea as I was bored for most of the story because I just knew what was going to happen. The first four hundred pages took me the longest to read because I watched Dune I twice, but thankfully it took me much less to finish the rest. The beginning (read the said first four hundred pages) were hard to read - which may not be much of an incentive for those planning to start I know - but the second half of the book even got me hooked. Frank's writing style may not have been entirely to my liking, the \"wow, what's happening\" moments didn't shock me as much as I thought they would, but the characters were amazing so I have to thank them because they are the reason for me being invested. Jessica was definitely my favorite here, followed by Paul, which I know is a boring answer, but what can I say, I liked them. They may even have become my favorite son and mother duo in books, which says a lot considering I've read a lot of stories in my life. \"If you harm my son,” she said, “you’ll have me to meet. I call you out now. I’ll carve you into a joint of—\" “Mother.” Paul stepped forward, touched her sleeve. “Perhaps if I explain to Jamis how—” “Explain!” Jamis sneered.\" Finally ending my rant, because I didn't plan to write so much, which is basically still nothing, because you could talk and talk without the end about this book, but I definitely plan to continuing this series. Maybe I'll even manage to finish all six books this year, we'll see. I hope at least. —————— maybe I'll be able to read all six books by the time the next movie comes out (2027?) we'll see (I'm already having trouble with all the names)"

        "text":"I have to write this review without rhythm so that it won’t attract a worm. In the distant future Arrakis is a hellhole desert planet where anyone who doesn’t die of thirst will probably be eaten by one of the giant sandworms. It’s also the only place where the precious spice melange can be found so it’s incredibly valuable, and the honorable Duke Leto Atreides has been ordered by the Padishah Emperor to take over control of Arrakis from his mortal enemies, the House Harkonnen. While this seems like a great offer on the surface the Duke and his people realize that it’s actually a cunning trap being set by the Emperor and Baron Harkonnen. The only hope seems to be allying with the local populace called Fremen whose harsh environment has led them to become an incredibly tough and disciplined people, but they have their own vision of what Arrakis should be. They also have a prophecy about the coming of a messiah figure who will lead them to freedom, and the Duke’s son Paul looks like he may be exactly who they’ve been waiting for. This is classic sci-fi that really deserves the label. What Frank Herbert accomplished in one novel is stunning because he built a fascinatingly detailed universe in which the politics, religion, economics, espionage, and military strategy are all equally important. He then blended these more grounded concepts with bigger sci-fi ideas like being able to use spice to see through space-time, and the scope of that encompasses trying to pick the proper path through various potential timelines as well as free will vs. fate. I think one of the factors that helps this story stay timeless is that so much of it is based on what humanity becomes vs. trying to predict what futuristic technology would be like. This is a society that once had a war with machines and has since rejected any type of computers so people have developed to fill the gap with the help of the spice. The Mentats are trained to use data to predict outcomes. The Navigators of the Guild have used so much of the spice to help them move through space that they’re mutating. The all female Bene Gesserit have developed a variety of skills to place their members alongside positions of power to help advance their breeding scheme that spans generations. Herbert also cleverly came up with an excuse that explains why knives and hand-to-hand combat are so important with the idea of the personal body shields. So even though we still got a good sci-fi’s novel worth of cool gadgets the emphasis is on what the people can do and how that’s developed over a long period of time. It also adds a lot of depth to the political dimensions because all of these groups have different agendas that cause them all to mistrust each other, but because they all fill these various roles none can exist without the others. There are also parallels to our world that are still in play because the idea of a desert people caught up in the power struggles of various outsiders because of their valuable natural resource is an obvious allegory to the Middle East that still works today. Plus, the classic film Lawrence of Arabia came out a few years before Herbert published this, and you have to think that it had some influence on him because there are elements of the story that seem very much inspired by it. While the whole concept of a Chosen One has gotten a bit worn over time that’s not Herbert’s fault, and this is still a fantastic sci-fi story with big ideas that also works as space opera as well as being an epic adventure story."

        "text":"5 ⭐️ 2024 Re-read I have consumed the Water of Life and felt the spice agony. It has revealed to me the error of my past ways. But as the Lisan al Gaib teaches us, ways can change. Original Review 4 ⭐ A word of warning as you venture out to peruse the veritable smorgasbord of delectable reviews for this Sci-Fi\/Fantasy Classic! Be sure to do your Du(n)e diligence. Be wary of key phrases such as “I don’t usually read Fantasy\/Sci-Fi”, “Too many made-up words” or “I’m just reading before the movie comes out”. These individuals have come down with a bad case of bandwagonitis and any self-respecting Sci-Fier-er cannot count on their reviews being in any way accurate or beneficial! As I’m firmly placed in the 3rd category of Blockbuster-hungry fools, I’d advise you to immediately move on to another review, there’s nothing of value here. In fact, I won’t actually be writing a review, I’ll simply address one simple question: What is Dune? Dune is sand as far as the eye can see. Dune is the sphincter opening.... of a desert tent. Dune is thirst. The distillate esthers of reclaimed waste; the sour effluvia of humanity. It is greedily, no… joyously sipping your overweight Uncle’s recycled knacker sweat in a desperate effort to quell the rapid loss of your own bodily fluid. Dune is the Water of Life; Molecular Modification; a Transcendental Trinocular Acid Trip. The [Boy] with Kaleidoscope Eyes experiencing a Psychokinesthetic extension of self. Dune is the middle-aged man who, on hearing praise for his young sons, must always exclaim \"I taught them everything they know!\" Dune is defiance of fear. Dune is an unsettling change in POV turned familiar, insightful friend. Dune is saying very little with a great many words. Dune is Pardot Kynes, micro-ecology, patience and long-term goals. Dune is the Shai-Hulud; the scandalous straddling of a worm. Dune is religion, planted and shaped to the needs of the latest conquests and heraldic symbols. Dune is the Ghost Wind of the Jihad Dune is Alia, is Stewie Griffin. Dune is Feyd-Rautha, is Commodus playing Gladiator. Dune is a feint, within a feint, within a feint. Dune is the house Atreides, is the Greek house Atreus. Dune is the Kwisatz Haderach; the Messiah; a planet afflicted by a Hero. Dune is power and wisdom at the cost of humanity; Friendship lost to worship. ”Everything he touched brought death and grief… it was like a disease that could spread across the universe… How little the universe knows about the nature of real cruelty!”"

        "text":"When the epic and ensemble cast movie of Dennis Villenevue is about to release, I decided to choose this fantastic and also one of my favorite cult sci-fi series as flashback Saturday reading! ( it looks better than David Lynch- Kyle MacLachlan version but the looks may be deceiving! At least Timothy and Zendaya look so cool in those stylish clothes and grimy expressions on their faces) After nearly three decades later, holding this paperback into my hands is magical experience take me a time travel: my mom was banging on my room’s door and telling me go outside and be social, getting some tan, instead of self-isolating myself by burying my head into books for days and feeding myself with junk food! ( the past mom had no idea, billions of people in the earth will be forced to do the similar things I’ve done in 2020 because of different reasons . At least the 2020-me did exactly same things with one difference: I threw boozes into equation! ) When I reread the series I clearly understand why I became addicted to the them( I’m talking about entire books) Firstly you find yourself drawn into this journey after reading few pages because Herbert’s storytelling skills are extraordinarily. The meaningful interludes, the character development, the impressive world building transform you to the other universe that you never want to leave. The awakening parts of Paul who discovers his own abilities, epic dynasty battles, ominous sand worms , intrigues, revenge, mind games present us a perfect blend of political economical, sociological, theological themes. I advise you to read the books first to understand the deeply ideological messages and unique philosophy of the series because sometimes the screenwriters have hard time to absorb and reflect the entire soul of the book! At least by reading the main story by yourself, you may directly reach to the core! Here are my favorite quotes of the book: “I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.” “Deep in the human unconscious is a pervasive need for a logical universe that makes sense. But the real universe is always one step beyond logic.” “The mystery of life isn't a problem to solve, but a reality to experience.” “When religion and politics travel in the same cart, the riders believe nothing can stand in their way. Their movements become headlong - faster and faster and faster. They put aside all thoughts of obstacles and forget the precipice does not show itself to the man in a blind rush until it's too late.” “Hope clouds observation.” “It is impossible to live in the past, difficult to live in the present and a waste to live in the future.” “Fear is the mind killer.” “Once men turned their thinking over to machines in the hope that this would set them free. But that only permitted other men with machines to enslave them.”"

        "text":"TW: pedophilia and rape off page Although this is discussed as a highly influential work in scifi, now having read it, I do think we have evolved past the need for this to be part of the canon. This book was a bit of a mess with the characters, world, and plot all feeling a bit disjointed and half baked. The world, while interesting and obviously very detailed, is barely explained to the reader and relies heavily on the appendix without actually providing context in the story (with the exception of a few things like spice and the worms). These characters all felt a little flat and\/or underutilized. The plot felt like two separate books, while being peppered with themes of glorifying colonialism, white saviors, and lack of agency for most of the women. Although I understand that is a product of when it was written, it still points to how there are much better works that have been written since even if they were influenced by this. I’m interested to see what they do with the movie adaptation. I’ll have a review and discussion on my channel coming up."

        "text":"In my head, the purpose of this review is very clear. It is to convince YOU to read this book. Yes, you! Waste time no more. Go grab a copy. Machiavellian intrigue, mythology, religion, politics, imperialism, environmentalism, the nature of power. All this set in a mind-boggling, frighteningly original world which Herbert ominously terms as an \"effort at prediction\". Dune had me hooked! First impression The very first stirring I felt upon opening the yellowed pages of Dune was that of stumbling upon an English translation of an ancient Arabic manuscript of undeniable power and potence which had an epic story to narrate. The tone was umistakably sombre and I realized Herbert was not here to merely entertain me, he was here to make me part of the legend of Muad'Dib . It was intriguing and challenging and heck, since I live for challenges I decided to take this one up too, gladly. The challenge was the complexity and depth of the plot, which left me perplexed, in the beginning. I knew there were dialogues which meant much more than their superficial meaning and was unable to grasp at it. I felt a yawning chasm between Herbert's vision and my limited understanding of it. However, of course, I plodded on and could feel the gap closing in with every page much to my joy and relief. The Foreword \"To the people whose labours go beyond ideas into the realm of 'real materials'- to the dry-land ecologists, wherever they may be, in whatever time they work, this effort at prediction is dedicated in humility and admiration.\" The foreword makes it pretty clear that Frank Herbert isn't kidding around. This is a serious effort at predicting how our world is going to look two thousand years from now and by God, it's a bloody good and detailed prediction. However, the real merit in this effort lies in the commentary on our lives in the present. Why Frank Herbert is a genius The setting of the book is arid futuristic. the plot is driven by political mind games reminiscent of The Game of Thrones. The issues he tackles are as modern as the colour television. Herbert's genius manifests itself in his ability to combine the past, the present and the future in one sweeping elegant move called Dune. Plot and Setting Dune is set in a futuristic technologically advanced world which after the Butlerian Jihad (the bloody war between Man and Machines) has eliminated all computers and passed a decree declaring \"Thou shalt not make a machine in the likeness of a man's mind\" . Since there are no computers, the essential working of the galaxy is still medieval and feudal with heavy reliance on men and their dallying around. Lots of thriller potential right there. Men with superhuman analytical abilities called Mentats have taken the place of Computers. On the other hand, we have the Bene Gesserit , an ancient school of mental and physical training for female students (it gives them superhuman intuitive powers) who follow a selective breeding program which makes them feared and mistrusted through the Imperium. Their desired end product of this breeding program is the Kwisatz Haderach , a superman who’ll be able to glimpse into the future. How he’ll be able to do this is rooted in Herbert’s idea of determinism: given that one can observe everything and analyze everything, one can effectively glimpse the future in probabilistic terms. Quantum physics anyone? The Kwisatz Haderach is the proposed solution to the male-female dichotomy, between the analytical and intuitive. The plot of Dune is almost wholly set on the desert planet of Arrakis (also referred to as Dune), an arid wasteland where water is so scarce that men have to wear stillsuits which recycle human moisture for further consumption. The source of the galaxy’s interest in the planet is Melange , a spice which bestows upon one longevity and prescient powers. Everything on the planet is permeated with the spice, the air, the sand, the food. Everybody on the planet is hopelessly addicted to the spice, their only hope for survival being their continued intake of the spice. The Spacing Guild , the economic and trading monopolistic arm of the Galaxy badly needs the spice for interstellar transport. This is because their frigates travel faster than the speed of light and hence travel backward in time. The spice is the only way they can look into the future and see their way ahead. How cool is that! All the powers on the Galaxy are out to mine the spice, braving the sandworms, their name merely an euphemism, for they are gigantic 200 metre long creatures which always come digging through the sand whenever spice mining is undertook. Always . There’s also another little glitch. There exist on the planet, the kickass native desert tribal Fremen , whom the foreign powers look down with suspicion and disdain. The Fremen ethos is one of survival and scarcity, driven by tribalism and egalitarianism. Okay, I’ll stop right there. No more spoilers about this. Except that they value water to the extent that spitting on a person is the highest honour they can bestow upon him. Our protagonists are the Atreides family, consisting of the Duke, his Bene Gesserit concubine Jessica and their son Paul, who have been entrusted the stewardship of Arrakis. We discover the alien planet of Arrakis along with them, firstly with fear, suspicion and wonder and ultimately, love and respect. Paul Muad’Dib , however is no ordinary prince. There’s a teeny weeny chance he might be the Kwisatz Haderach , something which troubles him constantly and gives us our conflicted hero. The poor chap trips balls over the spice and has visions of black hordes pillaging and murdering around town bearing his flag and sees his dead body multiple times. My favourite character, however has to be the Baron Vladmir Harkonnen , the most evil character I’ve ever come across in my literary excursions. He is ruddy ruthlessness, he is virile villainy, he is truculent treachery. He executes the inept chess players in his employ which says oodles about his badassery and his fondness for cold-blooded logic. He sees everything in simplistic chess terms. What is my best move? What is my opponent’s best move? Is there anything I can do to completely squash his move? Is there a tactic which leads to mate in three? Themes In this setting, Herbert does so much, it’s unbelievable. Religion, politics, the dynamic nature of power, the effects of colonialism, our blatant destruction of our environment are themes which run parallel to the intensely exciting and labyrinthine plot. He shows the paramount importance of myth making and religion for power to sustain over long periods of time. Man, as a political animal is laid completely bare. Real life Now these are my thoughts about what Herbert could have meant to be Arrakis- It makes perfect sense. Herbert draws heavy inspiration for the religious ideology of Muad’Dib from Islam. He says “When religion and politics ride in the same cart and that cart is driven by a living Holy man, nothing can stand in the path of such a people.” which is the philosphy of the politics of Islam. Islamism in a nutshell. The spice, much desired by everyone, is the oil. Baron Vladmir Harkonnen is symblomatic of the wily Russians. The Desert foxes Fremen are representative of the native Saudi desert-dwelling Bedouin tribe who have a strongly tribe-oriented culture and undoubtedly value water in equal measure. And the ultimate loser is the environment. Why do good books get over? I almost forget this is a science fiction novel, it’s that real. It is also scary and prophetic. It is a reading experience that will leave you dreaming of the grave emptiness of Arrakis and make you wish you were there to brave it all in the privileged company of the noble Fremen. Frank Herbert achieves the pinnacle of what a sci-fi author aspires to rise to; authentic world building."

OMG! Mel 🖤🐶🐺🐾 •••••••••••••••• I was so worried that I wouldn't understand a thing in this book. I will admit there are some things that went over my head but for the most part I figured it out. I remember a billion and 65 years ago I watched the movie and was like what the? Basically all I remember is Sting and sandworms. I would love to watch it again and see if I understand it more after reading the book. I'm still not sure what all the spices were about on Arrakis. I keep thinking it's like their farming like we would farm corn or tobacco, etc. I could be wrong and I didn't get the connection between the spice and the sandworms. Is it like a drug to them? I did read in the back of the book that is was like a drug when taken in small quantities and really addictive when taken in large quantities and that Muad'Did felt his prophesies were because of the spice. I liked Duke Leto and I hated that he was betrayed not long after they got to Arrakis. There is always some twat out there causing trouble. I really enjoyed Paul's character and his mother Jessica. They seemed like really strong people and adapted very well in everything they were put through. I didn't really pay too much attention to the other characters or I guess I should say I didn't have many thoughts about them. With the exception of the ones that betrayed them. I really enjoyed when Paul and Jessica had to travel to get away from the evil Baron Harkonnen before they were killed too. I don't know why, but I enjoyed their little journey. I think they were both great in their roles when they were found by the Freman and showed they were a force to be reckoned with. Now maybe I'm getting this all wrong but I'm trying to tell it through the way I saw it in my mind. I don't understand how Paul's sister, Alia, was an abomination. That one must have went over my head too. It might have had something to do with the poison Jessica took to become the Reverend Mother. I'm not sure but I know some of my goodreads friends that read this will get me sorted out =) Other than the sandworms and traitorous people on Arrakis, I was most freaked out by the thought of the water issue! I would NOT was to live somewhere there was a water shortage. And the part where they were talking about selling foot water, I can't even. Which basically means your stinky foot sweat! Anyhoo, I really loved the book! Mel 🖤🐶🐺🐾 ✅Thank you for the answers in my comments! 😊 MY BLOG: Melissa Martin's Reading List"

        "text":"Dune. No other single syllable means as much to the science fiction genre, a single word that conjures images of sandworms, spice wars, great battles between rival dynastic families and a massively detailed and intricately crafted universe. No wonder this is widely regarded as not just a Science Fiction masterpiece, but a literary achievement as well. Like a study of Shakespeare, the reader finds that this is an archetype upon which many influences and imitators have based their works. The complexity and depth of the creation is staggering and I am continually astounded at the discipline with which Herbert must have focused his imagination. This is the book upon which Herbert would base his greatest series and one that would outlive him as his son has continued to expand and add detail to the vast, immaculate tapestry woven by a true master of the genre. Encapsulating political, economic, sociological, biological, cultural and dynastic themes, Frank Herbert has set a high standard for later practitioners. Brilliant. ***2015 reread - Read years later, this has lost none of its narrative power, if anything I can better appreciate the virtuoso attention to detail Herbert exhibited in his epic creation. From the perspective of having read his later 5 Dune sequels, I am astounded at the rich tapestry he has woven. Most impressive was his close omnipresence, analyzing the thoughts and minute actions and subtle nuances of his complicated dynamic interplay of characters. The exhaustive training of the Bene Gesserit and the intricate relations of the Houses and the Guild would stand as a monumental benchmark for speculative fiction ever since. This time around I found myself looking more closely at the Harkonnens and will likely read some of Brian Herbert's additions to his fathers great work. ***2019 reread - I'm even more in love with this book and am again in awe of Herbert's narrative skill. This time around I noticed that all of the quotes that begin chapters are from Princess Irulan and I paid close attention to how Herbert crafted these interludes. I also was drawn to the religious undertones that really began very early in the book and how Paul realized his gifts and was preparing for his role in the beginning chapters - all demonstrating Herbert's great narrative skill. Finally, I became more aware of what a great character was Gurney Halleck. While the ghola of Duncan Idaho dominated the later books, Herbert's creation of Halleck was an enjoyable and thought provoking addition to this masterpiece. *** 2025 reread - This has lost nothing over the years and if nothing else, is even more potent now. I love that a new generation of fans, inspired by a very good adaptation are discovering Herbert's greatest work and for good reason, this is not only great science fiction, but good literature. Frank Herbert's prose is gifted and I am again amazed at the intricacy of his world building. There is foreshadowing within foreshadowing and his vision is something to behold."

        "text":"Let me start by first apologizing to everyone who loves this classic. I don't doubt Dune was something special when it first came out in the 1960s. But reading it for the first time today, it feels horribly outdated to me and at times almost incomprehensible. I was warned going into this story that the beginning is extremely hard to understand, but that is an understatement. I could barely follow its scene after scene of dialogue referencing people and places and events, all with no explanation or context. It literally feels like I was just dropped into the middle of a book, and everything had already been explained elsewhere. But it gets better, right? Well, only somewhat. A narrative does take shape, but the writing style remains confusing and obscure. It manages to be both long-winded and not clear enough, if you can believe that. Certain obvious points are harped on again and again, but other crucial ones are merely glossed over. Then, when you inevitably miss those important points, they create this cascading effect that keeps you mired in confusion. The writing is also pretentious, with regular or nonsensical things consistently being presented in a profound way. There are plenty of extraneous paragraphs that sound good until you try to discern their meaning, at which point you'd be stumped. This sort of writing really confused me because I couldn't figure out which paragraphs mattered and needed to be dissected carefully to suss out their hidden meaning, and which ones are just adornment. As for the story itself, it was a complete mismatch with my interests. I like science fiction with lots of real science. Instead, this is a space opera (a.k.a. a soap opera that takes place in space) with no actual science. It's all political intrigue, melodrama, doublespeak, and who has power over who, which I have zero interest in. I also couldn't care less about how fawningly amazing Paul is and how he is destined to be the chosen one. This was such a frustrating reading experience because it could've been an amazing story. And there were moments in the beginning when I thought it was going in those creative directions. I was riveted during that infamous test in the first scene, only to realize that it was completely irrelevant to the rest of the story. Or to see where the book could take the scientific aspects of a desert planet and a population with so little water, which it didn't other than a bit of lip service. But the book stubbornly chose to disregard these more interesting avenues, and instead took the most straightforward, boring route of making this into a story about power struggle. Well, we could've saved ourselves the bother and just stayed on Earth for that. ~~~~~~~~~~~~ ✧ Connect with me ✧ Instagram ✧"

        "text":"There's a characteristically witty essay by Borges about a man who rewrites Don Quixote , many centuries after Cervantes. He publishes a novel with the same title, containing the same words in the same order. But, as Borges shows you, the different cultural context means it's a completely new book! What was once trite and commonplace is now daring and new, and vice versa. It just happens to look like Cervantes's masterpiece. Similarly, imagine the man who was brave or stupid enough to rewrite Dune in the early 21st century. Like many people who grew up in the 60s and 70s, I read the book in my early teens. What an amazing story! Those kick-ass Fremen! All those cool, weird-sounding names and expressions they use! (They even have a useful glossary in the back). The disgusting, corrupt, slimy Harkonnens - don't you just love to hate them! When former-aristo-turned-desert-guerilla-fighter Paul Muad'Dib rides in on a sandworm at the end to fight the evil Baron and his vicious, cruel nephew, of course you're cheering for him. Who the hell wouldn't be? So that was the Dune we know and love, but the man who rewrote it now would get a rather different reception. Oh my God! These Fremen, who obviously speak Arabic , live on a desert planet which supplies the Universe with melange, a commodity essential to the Galactic economy, and in particular to transport. Not a very subtle way to say \"oil\"! They are tough, uncompromising fighters, who are quite happy to use suicide bombing as a tactic. They're led by a charismatic former rich kid (OK, we get who you mean), who inspires them to rise up against the corrupt, degenerate... um, does he mean Westerners? Or only the US? And who is Baron Harkonnen intended to be? I'm racking my brains... Dubya doesn't quite seem to fit, but surely he means someone ? Unless, of course, he's just a generic stereotype who stands for the immoral, sexually obsessed West. This is frightening. What did we do to make Frank al-Herbert hate us so much? You'd have people, not even necessarily right-wingers, appearing on TV to say that the book was dangerous, and should be banned: at the very least, it incites racial hatred, and openly encourages terrorism. But translations would sell brilliantly in Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, and a bad movie version would soon be made in Turkey. I honestly don't think Herbert meant any of that; but today, it's almost impossible not to wonder. If anyone reading this review is planning to rewrite The Tale of Benjamin Bunny , you'd better make sure you get your timing right. Who knows how it will be interpreted five years from now?"

        "text":"No one should argue the importance Dune . It laid the foundations for a great deal of the themes and constructs in modern science fiction. Frank Herbert was as important to the genre as Isaac Asimov and Arthur Clarke. Unfortunately, just like them, he's quite dated, and his books can be a labor to read. One thing he maintained from old science fiction was prim and scientific dialogue that no one would ever actually speak. I've known many scientists, and they don't talk like this. You're not going to convince me a child does. The stuffy dialogue is inserted into even stuffier narrative, until it feels like nothing is organic about Herbert's prose. This is a terrible tragedy when you've got a world that he put so much effort into building - and it is an amazing feat of world-building, technically interplanetary building. But unlike J.R.R. Tolkien, who he is so frequently compared to, Herbert didn't make sure to include a great story in his world. Instead he included a story that frequently illustrated how clunky an artificial world can be, even if it's lovingly crafted. I struggled to attach or find interest in anyone, yet they're more archetypes than human beings, whose logic races past modern skepticism and whose dialogue is cloyingly artificial, the way people cared for the Hobbits, Dwarves and Rangers. In his world-building, Tolkien at least saved himself from being dated by antedating himself, and even with his illuminated prose, wrought more characteristics in just one protagonist than all of Dune 's cast. Even the political intrigue Herbert tries to fall back on was overdone in the Spy genre decades before he started this book. All fans of the \"Genre\" genres should appreciate Herbert's massive contributions, but they shouldn't pretend to enjoy the books if they don't, and they should be wary of certain pitfalls typical of science fiction that survived into his landmark work."

From the very first pages, this book plunges you in at the deep-end with an absurd amount of overly complex world-building, which just makes the book laborious to work through.

Sure, it might be a bit too soon for her, but she DID insist because we'll be seeing Dune part 2 later this year. And she happens to know that I'm a rabid uberfan with no mercy or remorse. PLUS, I was able to read from my gorgeous new hardcover copy gifted to me by my best friend and that really does make all the difference, no? Update 9\/15\/21 Re-read. Number 14. I cannot get over how beautiful this book is. Still my favorite after all these years. It only gets better with every re-read. Update 8\/28\/17 Re-read. Number 13. :) I cry when Paul meets Gurney. I shiver when Jessica consoles Chani. I'm awestruck by the peaks and troughs of time, free-will, and the weakness in Paul even as he heroically strives against the evil that is about to be unleashed upon the universe. *sigh* Perfection. Easily the number one book I've ever read. :) I waver, sometimes, but right now, it is my absolute favorite. :) Original Review: This is a phenomenal classic of literature. It's not just science fiction. It transcends science fiction, as a fascinating discussion of free-will versus inevitability. Can the Jihad be denied? Can Paul ever really avoid his own death, despite seeing every time-line play out with him as the butt of every cosmic joke? Can even cruelty or mercy even remain comprehensible after such knowledge? Yes, I think this work outdoes Nietzsche. It certainly does a great job of making us care about the question. Is this all? Is this just a work that pays great justice to philosophy of action and inaction? Or is the novel merely a clever play at turning the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle into the physical embodiment of a man? It is that, of course. The Kwisatz Haderach can be many places at once, and he can be both alive and dead at the same time just like that certain cat. Is the novel a coming of age tale, first set as a mirror against his father Leto, only then to mirror the whole universe that had just turned against him? Yes, of course. He was, after all, both the product of all his upbringing and his genes, embodying the question of nature versus nurture. He was taught within many schools of martial arts and assassins, as well as training the mind in both the schools of the Mentats with their pure logic and that of the mystics, the Bene Gesserit, that allows complete control over the body down to the cellular level. And if this training wasn't enough, he was deeply schooled in politics, leadership, and the meaning of loyalty. The boy was raised right. Of course, that is nothing without ninety generations of genetic bloodline tampering from the Bene Gesserit, right? To become the fulcrum between cellular memory, tapping the minds and lives of all your genetic ancestors as well as tapping the ability to fold time and space, to become the eye of a storm of time. What a damn brilliant setup for one tiny character, no? His training links to the unlocking of his genes and to the life-extending and enveloping spice, Melange, to make him not merely aware of time in a theoretical sense, but eventually to be unable to discern what was in the past, the present, or the future. Here's a true Super-Man, well beyond Nietzsche. And don't believe for one second that this serious discussion about what would make a superior man makes for dull reading. No. We've got PLOT that's probably some of the most exciting and visceral in all of literature, driving us right into the web of intrigue, vengeance, treachery, and galactic politics. To quote the text, we've got \"Plans within Plans,\" and it hardly stops there. We know the House Atreides is falling into a trap laid by the Emperor and House Harkonnen, and yet free-will and pride prevents any chance to avoid it. The setup is brilliant and extremely political, giving us character sketches of some of the most brilliant and memorable characters of all time. Duke Leto, the Red Duke, the most honorable and beloved leader. Duncan Idaho, the emotional and intuitive hero. Gurney Halleck, archetypal loyalist and troubadour. Lady Jessica, the woman who ought to have had all honor in life, but was unjustly reviled and set aside for political necessity. (Chani being both her mirror and her eventual glory.) And of course, my favorite character of all time, Paul Muad'dib Atreides, the one that would prevent the greater evils he foresaw, and went to enormous lengths and sacrifice to achieve, but who eventually failed in his task because even a god cannot overcome destiny. (Or the will of so many minds set as one.) So damn brilliant. Frank Herbert spent five years writing this treasure, working and reworking it until he published it at age 25. None of his other works come close to this masterpiece, and there's little wonder. It was birthed, fully-formed, like Athena from Zeus's head, with enormous forethought and care. The worldbuilding was just as carefully formed, from the ecology of Arrakis and the life-cycles of the sandworms, to the history and the creation of the Fremen from their mild beginnings as Zensunni Wanderers, adherents to the Orange Catholic Bible, to their history of oppression so like those of those who are Jewish, to their settling and hardening of their bodies and souls in the wastes of Arrakis, also just like the Jewish who carved out a place for themselves in Israel. (Current politics aside, this was a very potent idea before 1965 when Herbert wrote this, and indeed, the core is still just as powerful when you turn it back to Muslims.) The Galactic culture is rich and detailed. The CHOAM economic consortium, with their monopoly on space travel and their need for the Spice to allow them to see a short period into the future to plot a safe course before folding space. The Empire is caught on a knife's edge between a single power and every other House who sit in the possibility of putting aside all their squabbles for the sole purpose of checking the Emperor, if they so desired. (And Duke Atreides was such a possible popular leader among all the Great Houses, which was the primary reason the Emperor wanted him dead.) And of course, we have our Villains. The Baron Harkonnen has always been a crowd pleaser. Brilliant in his own right, devious and able to corrupt anyone with just the right sorts of pressure, including a certain absolutely trustworthy doctor we might mention. \"The Tooth! The Tooth!\" -- You can't handle the Tooth! Feyd Rautha Harkonnen is especially interesting for the question of nature versus nurture. The Bene Gesserit had intended him to mate with Paul, who should have been Leto and Jessica's daughter, and that offspring should have been the cumulation of ninety years of a breeding experiment to recreate the Kwisatz Haderach which had come about almost by accident during the Butlerian Jihad in the deep past, to overthrow the AI overlords. He was practically Paul's genetic twin, or at least, his potential to be the \"One who can be many places at once\" was on par with Paul. But instead of fulfilling the kind of destiny that we get with Paul, we see him grow up under the auspices of his Uncle the Baron, becoming as cruel and devious as he was deadly. He was the argument of nurture in the conversation, of course, and having so very little of it eventually cost him his life. I often wonder about the directions that Dune could have taken, all those little paths in time and circumstance that could have been. What if Feyd had been brought to Arrakis earlier and overwhelmed with Spice the way that Paul had? Sure, he wouldn't have been able to convert the unconscious changes into conscious manipulation, but he might have had enough glimpses of the future, the way that the Fremen did, to have given him the edge he would have needed to kill Paul. And then there's a relatively minor character, Hasimir Fenring, the Emperor's personal assassin, who was nearly the Kwisatz Haderach, himself. Unable to breed true, he was still potent enough to be completely hidden to Paul's time-sight in the same way that Paul was hidden from the Spacing Guild's weaker time-sight. His training as a skilled killer was also superior to Paul. He was, by all the hints and tricks in the tale, Paul's perfect downfall. It always gives me shivers to think about, and it was only in a single instant of both recognition and pity from Paul that stayed Fenring from killing our hero. It was just a moment of whim. The setup was gorgeous. Paul's pity, had it been missing at his moment of greatest triumph over the Emperor, would have meant Paul's assured death. I still wonder, to this day, what stayed Frank Herbert's hand from killing his most wonderful darling. We knew the pressure of religion and politics was going to have its way upon all the oppressed peoples of Dune. The return of a monstrous religious Jihad was going to happen one way or another, sweeping across the galaxy and toppling the Empire, regardless of Paul's frantic plans and desires. Paul's own death would only mean a higher level of fanaticism, and Frank Herbert's warning against unreasoning devotion would have been made even clearer with Paul's death. Perhaps it was pity that stayed his hand. Who are we to say who lives and who dies? If you really think this review is overlong, then I apologize, but please understand that I could absolutely go on and on much longer than this. It is a symptom of my devotion to this most brilliant of all tales. And yes, it still holds up very, very well after twelve reads. I am quite shocked and amazed."

Update! Just wanted to say how much I loved the movie. Go see it. It was probably good that there was a gap between the time I read this and the movie. Read 2015 Amazing! A masterpiece of SF with which I will probably compare all SF books that I’ll read in the future. It goes in my favorites shelf. This is my 3rd attempt to read Dune and I am really grateful that I did not succeed the first two times I tried as I was too young to understand all the subtleties. I would have probably enjoyed it as a very well written adventure novel but nothing more. That would have been a pity as Dune is so much more than a story about space travel and epic battles between good and evil. It presents complex philosophical ideas, explores ecological issues, cultural identity and differences. Also a major theme is represented by religion and religious leadership. The disturbing part about this book, taken in the current political context, is how easily the Fremen can be identified with an Arab nation. The spice can be seen as “oil” and the Harkonnens as evil westerners\/Russians that are exploiting the natural resources without thinking about the locals and the environment. I saw that others reviewers saw this as well."

        "text":"‘ Deep in the human unconscious is a pervasive need for a logical universe that makes sense. But the real universe is always one step beyond logic. ’ The sheer scope and magnitude of this 1965 sci-fi drama is staggering, populated with an extensive cast of characters and a rich universe full of well-rounded lore, intricate politics where every actions is revealed as ‘ plans within plans within plans, ’ and dynamic cultures all set on a collision course of plot that rightfully earned it a wide readership and canonization as a “Classic” work. I found it lived up to the hype and opened itself up more upon a reread, validating the fond memories I had of it from reading it first as a young teenager smitten with anything sci-fi. This book has zero chill and everything is to extreme and epic levels, including the size of worms. But come for the Bene Gesserits, best part. While there isn’t much to say that likely hasn’t already been said better, I still want to pause and reflect on some key elements in Dune . This is such a well-crafted book that addresses themes of power, religion, historical records as mythmaking and environmental concerns in a narrative about proxy wars and power struggles that speak just as loudly today as it did about 1960s foreign policy. If you are looking for a book of epic proportions, you can’t go wrong with Dune . The best part about this book, to me, is the way it is constantly expanding. There is great world-building and a rich lore that recalls my glee first exploring The Lord of the Rings , but what really excites me is the way Herbert reveals it all. The book starts so small—a visit to a cottage from an old woman that seems like such a small scale fairy tale on page one—and swiftly becomes gargantuan and never stops growing. It leaves you constantly feeling yourself shrink beside a universe always revealing itself as more complex than you had realized. I enjoy the way Herbert only gives you the minimum of what you need to understand and lets it all slowly unfold when necessary. ‘ They've a legend here, a prophecy, that a leader will come to them, child of a Bene Gesserit, to lead them to true freedom. It follows the familiar messiah pattern. ’ For newcomers, the basis of the book is that Paul has been quite literally bred to be a messiah and is engulfed in a difficult power struggle over a planet that essentially upholds the interplanetary economy through mining an addictive substance called “spice”. You might quickly find yourself thinking of spice as oil and the planet Arrakis as Middle East and Northern Africa (Tor put out a really great essay on the way Herbert engages with Muslim culture and traditions ), you know, since there was a whole Cold War going on at the time and giving the villain Baron Harkonnen a first name like Vladimir might make you wonder if this is all an elaborate metaphor. The Baron saying ‘ in politics, the tripod is the most unstable of all structures, ’ might make you think of the three branches of US government. You get the idea. There are also WWII holdovers present, such as the Sardaukar as an elite fighting force trained on Salusa Secundus to make sure you catch the S.S. reference. That’s all very much there, but this book is so much more than a simple sci fi rendition of the Cold War and Herbert definitely wants you to apply these themes to our larger political and religious global interactions. ‘ Fear is the mind-killer. ’ Another aspect I find fascinating in Dune is the depiction of Paul Atreides in the ‘chosen one’ trope. Paul has reservations, though not due to thinking he doesn’t deserve it (dude is royalty anyways, essentially) but because he fears what it will bring. Paul’s powers are enhanced through spice and he is able to perceive the future, and in almost every possible scenario he sees nothing but mass war in his name: ’ They were all caught up in the need of their race to renew its scattered inheritance, to cross and mingle and infuse their bloodlines in a great new pooling of genes. And the race knew only one sure way for this—the ancient way, the tried and certain way that rolled over everything in its path: jihad. ’ The notion of precognition brings free will into question, particularly when a certain individual appears in visions of the future but dies before it happens. It becomes a universe where individual free wills are all acting upon one another in an attempt to control the narrative of time. ’ And what [Paul] saw was a time nexus within this cave, a boiling of possibilities focused here, wherein the most minute action—a wink of an eye, a careless word, a misplaced grain of sand—moved a gigantic lever across the known universe. He saw violence with the outcome subject to so many variables that his slightest movement created vast shiftings in the pattern. ’ History is written by the winners, or so the saying goes, and much of this novel focuses on the way the narrative of time is constructed through the mythologizing of people and events. ‘ History will call us wives, ’ Jessica says to Chani, assuring her that her role as the lover to Paul will not be usurped by the princess he marries for the throne. Much of the book shows the dynamics between Paul as the Man and Paul as the myth, with characters like Stilgar recognizing that by being in service to the myth they too will be immortalized in the stories. Narratives become a form or power, and, as I’ll discuss soon, can be a form of control. Perhaps it is because power and control are so central to this novel that it feels so very timeless and just as applicable to 2021 as it did to 1965. In regards to power, leadership also becomes another key theme. ‘ Power and fear, ’ House Atreides Duke Leto says, ‘ The tools of statecraft, ’ a sentiment later echoed with all the same key terms by Baron Harkonnen. The two leaders are set up at the start as foils to each other, each trying to have their grip on Arrakis (there are some strong colonialism themes in this book and it delves into how troubling it is and how even those we might view as the savior turn out to be just another oppressor and colonizer) but their leaderships are defined by Leto’s rule through caring for his people while Harkonnen sees everyone as a useful pawn. ’ A leader, you see, is one of the things that distinguishes a mob from a people. He maintains the level of individuals. Too few individuals, and a people reverts to a mob. ’ Having recently finished The Dispossessed , I could have preferred some more voices in this book looking for better forms of ruling that don’t involve exploitation, but that’s not what this book is about so I’ll move on. What this book really focuses on is the ways power can be maintained, which crops up most in this novel through use of religion. ‘ But it's well known that repression makes a religion flourish, ’ we read, and the harsh life on Arrakis makes it the perfect setting where indoctrination of religion for the purpose of power can shape a community and unite them. Religion is a form of storytelling, having the people all believe in one shared story with all its myths and promises. ‘ You deliberately cultivated this air, this bravura, ’ Jessica instructs Paul, ‘ you never cease indoctrinating. ’ The stronger the shared faith, the more easily a leader can make them do what they need. It also helps that everyone is high as shit all the time. ‘ Religion and law among our masses must be one and the same, ’ Kynes's father says: ‘ An act of disobedience must be a sin and require religious penalties. This will have the dual benefit of bringing both greater obedience and greater bravery. We must depend not so much on the bravery of individuals, you see, as upon the bravery of a whole population. ’ Religion is being used constantly to shape the people for the purpose of their leaders, even in what seems an admirable purpose of turning desert Arrakis into a green paradise (and without a religious idea of paradise, how can a people who only know dry dirt and hardship even imagine a paradise?). ‘ The real wealth of a planet is in its landscape, how we take part in that basic source of civilization—agriculture. ’ This latter bit is also extremely key to Dune. The planet itself is practically a character in the novel, much in the ways the landscape is like a character in Westerns. The landscape of Arrakis truly shapes the people there, and we see a contrast between Arrakis and Caladan and how water as a precious resource on Arrakis changes many customs. Such as how spitting at a person is a sign of respect on Arrakis. Changing the environment on Arrakis is an interesting concept because, in order to make it thrive, what would the cost be? Would it disrupt spice, thereby collapsing the galaxy’s economy? Can these people ever be free, because doing so would require the complete dismantling of the governmental systems currently ruling? Can I try this spice? I would like to try the spice. There is also something to be said about the harshness of an environment being an ideal place for strenght in unity around a cause to crop up. Le Guin explores this in The Dispossessed as well, with the anarchist planet having a similar dry desert vibe as Arrakis and scarcity being a major player in what keeps the people bonded and working together. The Fremen are tough because of their environment, similiarly the Sardaukar are trained in extremely harsh environments as well. Dune plays a lot with ideas on how fascism and strongmen can quickly rise to power in times of economic instability—or the threat of it—and here the difficult planets tend to produce the most deadly fighters. Mix religion in and you have an instant army if you can convince everyone you are the chosen one. There is so much more to discuss in this book, particularly the Bene Gesserits and the Guild who are pulling a lot of strings, or just how friggen awesome the worms are. This is a big book with a lot of big ideas, and also a lot of ambiguity to them that I really appreciate. It is certainly a precursor for a lot of popular epics to follow. George Lucas certainly took notes and I imagine George R.R. Martin read this and said “wait, you can just kill beloved characters that easily!?” before rewriting Duke Leto as Ned Stark. While I can concede to those who find it boring and dry, I rather enjoyed all the history and lore and found this to be incredibly fun. 4.5\/5"

        "text":"People often forget that this series is what innovated our modern concept of science fiction (up until Neuromancer and The Martix, at least). Dune took the Space Opera and asked if it might be more than spandex, dildo-shaped rockets, and scantily-clad green women. Herbert created a vast and complex system of ancient spatial politics and peoples, then set them at one another's throats over land, money, and drugs. Dune is often said to relate to Sci Fi in the same way that Tolkien relates to Fantasy. I'd say that, as far as paradigm shift, this is widely true. Both entered genres generally filled with the odd, childish, and ridiculous and injected a literary sensibility which affected all subsequent authors. Few will challenge the importance of Star Wars' effect on film and storytelling in general, but without Dune, there would be no Star Wars. Princess Alia, the desert planet, the Spice, the Bene Gesserit, and Leto II all have direct descendants in the movies. It is unfortunate that Lucas seems to have forgotten in these later years that his best genius was pilfered from Herbert, Campbell, and Kurosawa. Though I have heard that the later books do not capture the same eclectic energy as the first, Dune itself is simply one of the most original and unusual pieces of Sci Fi ever written. Read it, Starship Troopers, Ringworld, Neuromancer, and Snowcrash and you'll know everything you need to about Sci Fi: that you want more."

        "text":"Ok, my only reference for Dune was the 1984 movie with Kyle MacLachlan. And, honestly, it was the main reason I've always wanted to read this book. Ohmygod look what that fake-looking piece of plastic shit is doing to poor MacLachlan's nose? How was he even able to act with that thing pushing his nostrils to the side of his face? I can't stop looking at it! Anyway. I remember loving that movie when I was young. Ahhhh. I honestly didn't remember much about it other than it was sorta weird, there were giant worms, a bunch of people had glowing blue eyes, and Sting was in it. After listening to this audiobook, I decided to rewatch the movie and relive the good times. Wow. Just wow . What in the holy hell did I just watch? Because whatever it was, it certainly didn't have much to do with the actual book. There were some fucking weird changes that they made to the movie that really didn't do anything for the plot. Like that gross dude with the shit in his face that flew around in that goofy air suit? In the book, he's just a fat dude! And that thing they do where they all have drain plugs attached to their hearts? Not in the book, either! In fact, none of that fucknut crazy\/gross sci-fi shit is in the book. Blowing shit up with their voice guns? Nope. Bald Bene Gesserits? Nope. Bugs with butthole mouths? Nope. Mentat's with clip-on eyebrows who drink juice that gives them herpes lips? Nope. Captain Jean-Luc Picard going into battle with a pug? Fuck no! The list goes on and on... Not that it should matter. But it does! Because I was expecting something realllyreallyreally different, and if you go into this (like me) you may end up...well, not disappointed but maybe shocked? Having said that, I think the book was definitely better. There was no reason for ass-mouth monsters or oily rock stars in weird rubber underwear. It just makes a lot more sense the way Herbert wrote it. It's a magic is science tale set in space with an incredibly interesting look at how politics and religion can hold hands with each other and make war babies. I can see why people rave about it. It's honestly an incredibly insightful novel. You know, if you're into that sort of thing... A little dense , but worth it. But dense. That's worth saying twice because this thing is massive and you may get lost in it if giant word monsters aren't your jam when it comes to reading. I listened to the Audible version which is 21 HOURS (and 2 minutes!) long and might be the way to go for anyone looking for the easy way out. And I am ALWAYS looking for the easy way out."

        "text":"“I have seen a friend become a worshiper, he thought.” I don’t think I actually *enjoyed* this book. But I certainly respected the hell out of it. For a bit I thought I had it all figured out, pegged it as your bog-standard Chosen One story, and then it went where I didn’t think it’d go and neatly subverted my expectations. It tackled stuff that is uncomfortable and therefore is generally handwaved over in the usual SF epics. And for that I seriously respected this dense complex tome. We people tend to love the idea of a charismatic all-powerful leader who inspires faithful following and true fervor, that cult-like blind devotion . We give those leaders tremendous power to lead and decide and determine fates. So many stories rooted in the weight of our species collective history glorify this; so many countries still apparently yearn for powerful visionary leaders that others proclaim to be dictators. So many religions go to wars over the legacy left by a popular charismatic leader centuries ago, interpreting those legacies as the engine for the action, destruction, obedience. Hero worship. Messianic worship. Prophecies and tyrannies. Desire for a Savior to rescue you from the evil. Good intentions paving the road to hell. It all leads to terrifying places which we may be powerless to stop. “A leader, you see, is one of the things that distinguishes a mob from a people. He maintains the level of individuals. Too few individuals, and a people reverts to a mob.” This is a novel of a reluctant Messiah, the journey of a man becoming the Chosen One — but unlike the traditional story of a charismatic savior, this is a darker picture of the dangers of messianism and hero worship, of allowing blind devotion replace common sense . The book ends in an ambiguous place, and I presume the sequels may develop the theme or run away from it and make this a more traditional hero journey. But I certainly hope not. Because the dark implications of messianism say more about human nature than the happier stories based on the same idea, but with more idealism . We love our ideas of ideal benevolent rulers who can set things right, don’t we? Or the martyr figures inspiring “righteous” battles? Messiahs and figureheads seem to fulfill the deep-seated cultural longing for an inspirational leader, don’t they? Friends become followers and worshippers, and the metaphorical slope becomes quite slippery . “The Fremen have a simple, practical religion,\" he said. \"Nothing about religion is simple,\" she warned. But Paul, seeing the clouded future that still hung over them, found himself swayed by anger. He could only say: \"Religion unifies our forces. It's our mystique.\" \"You deliberately cultivate this air, this bravura,\" she charged. \"You never cease indoctrinating.\" \"Thus you yourself taught me,\" he said.” Yes, in Dune Frank Herbert hints at the dangers present in such ideas. What seems like your traditional hero’s journey turns out darker and more sinister. But it’s not the rise of an antihero either. It’s subtler than that, without actually being all that subtle. “No more terrible disaster could befall your people than for them to fall into the hands of a Hero,\" his father said. Paul Atreides, in his own words, is “something unexpected.” A son of a planetary Duke (because an interstellar post-technology future is actually feudal) and a highly trained Bene-Gesserit concubine of the Duke (basically a member of the order\/Sisterhood of superpowered highly trained mind ninjas with strong political worlds-changing ambitions and generations-long breeding experiments aimed at creation of a controllable superhero) , Paul fits very well the idea of a Messiah of the tribal resilient society of Fremen people of the harsh desert planet Arrakis , neatly fulfilling their religious prophecies (that may have been stealthily planted before by the above-mentioned supernatural ninja order) and possessing genetic superpowers himself, augmented by rigorous training and catalyzed by the ingestion of a magical wonder-drug known as spice . “He found that he no longer could hate the Bene Gesserit or the Emperor or even the Harkonnens. They were all caught up in the need of their race to renew its scattered inheritance, to cross and mingle and infuse their bloodlines in a great new pooling of genes. And the race knew only one sure way for this—the ancient way, the tried and certain way that rolled over everything in its path: jihad.” But Paul through his prescient powers can see what his mythologized destiny leads to. A galactic scale slaughter led by fanatics in his name. And there is not a way to escape it, once your life fits the mysticism of their faith (even if the faith and prophecies were stealthily prereplanted for sort of a similar purpose). Religious fanatics are destined to wage a brutal war that the Messiah is unable to stop. “When law and duty are one, united by religion, you never become fully conscious, fully aware of yourself. You are always a little less than an individual.” With great power comes great responsibility, and all that jazz. But is any of it actually worth it? Wouldn’t the world be better without the burden of Heroes? Are you destined to become exactly what you’re trying to avoid? All this is gently hinted at, laid out in the framework of the appealing Hero’s journey. It seems that should you desire, you can still easily choose to read it as a typical hero’s\/antihero’s story, just less idealistic than it could be. But that would be Star Wars and not Dune . “He was warrior and mystic, ogre and saint, the fox and the innocent, chivalrous, ruthless, less than a god, more than a man. There is no measuring Muad'Dib's motives by ordinary standards. In the moment of his triumph, he saw the death prepared for him, yet he accepted the treachery. Can you say he did this out of a sense of justice? Whose justice, then? Remember, we speak now of the Muad'Dib who ordered battle drums made from his enemies' skins, the Muad'Dib who denied the conventions of his ducal past with a wave of the hand, saying merely: \"I am the Kwisatz Haderach. That is reason enough.” And you also can’t help but be mesmerized by a harsh desiccated planet where life is focused on survival, where not even water but mere moisture is the most coveted and rarest thing, where hopes for a better, wetter, greener future quietly flourish, tied into messianic ideas but grounded in science. The place of nightmares, written vividly and skillfully, making me want to gulp down a gallon of drink just because I can, making me appreciate that my reality doesn’t hinge on surviving on my reclaimed bodily fluids. The world is harsh, unforgiving, brutal, hostile. The characters - well, mostly Paul, but to an extent his mother Jessica as well - are cold, calculating, composed and often very unsympathetic. Paul’s father values lives over property. Paul’s actions, on the other hand, lead to eyebrow-raising among his father’s old lieutenants who note the difference in priorities: “Nothing money won't repair, I presume,\" Paul said. \"Except for the lives, m'Lord,\" Gurney said, and there was a tone of reproach in his voice as though to say: \"When did an Atreides worry first about things when people were at stake?” It’s dense and complex, full of politics, short on actual science fiction but full of ruminations on human nature — and it leaves me feeling that all of this is a beginning of another cycle of violence, just with a new figurehead at the mast. As Terry Pratchett said, “But here's some advice, boy. Don't put your trust in revolutions. They always come around again. That's why they're called revolutions.” A new Hero or a new Messiah comes, and begets another cycle or struggle and violence, to be reset anew by a new figurehead sometimes in the future . All while sandworms quietly slither under the sand. ————— Oh yeah, there are sandworms, too. ————— 4 stars out of respect for Herbert’s subversive story that made me think. I’m content with the story ending here, with ambiguity and dread for what’s to come.[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>"

        "text":"Why You Should Read Dune (video): https:\/\/youtu.be\/oOomSvGXfaM Asking me to describe why Dune is so important to me is like asking a child to explain nuclear fusion. I do my best in the video linked above, but just know it probably isn't for the reasons you think. My journey to Dune becoming my absolute favorite book of all time goes all the way back to the mid-1990's upon finding it in my high school library and deciding to give it a try because I remembered my dad and brother watching the movie when I was a kid. At 15 years old, I got to the middle of \"book II\" and gave it a big fat DNF. I decided it just wasn't for me. At 17, for the 30th anniversary, I decided to try again and while I finished it that time, I thought the ideas were overly pretentious and way too out there. But a year went by and somehow, it was still in my head. I thought about it frequently and I began to ponder...did I actually really like it? I tried again the final weeks of my senior year of high school and became absolutely obsessed and it has stayed that way for almost the last 25 years. Dune is social science-fiction in that it's more concerned with the people and society than it is with hard science. Besides telling you that these navigators \"fold space\" for interstellar travel, Herbert doesn't bog you down with the math. He focuses more on the politics, cultures, religion, and philosophies of a world rich in the most valuable resource in the known universe, but barren in everything else. If you go into the story expecting a Star Wars style adventure, you're going to leave disappointed. Dune is extremely thought provoking and deals with the struggles of coming of age while the fate of the universe is on your shoulders. I'll also say that the book is certainly not for everyone. If you love things like ASOIAF and The Wheel of Time, there is no way this book won't be for you as both of those series borrowed heavily from the story Frank crafted. But I think it truly depends on where you are at in your life. Look, I just told you the story of how it took until my third reading for this to really click with me. Those who the story and lessons click with, it REALLY clicks with. But, again, this isn't a crowd pleaser and not everyone is going to love it, especially modern readers. So while I encourage those that are interested to read it, I expect more modern readers to not like it than like it. Not only is this the greatest science-fiction story of all time, but I believe it should be on mandatory reading lists in schools and everyone interested in the genre owe it to themselves to read the pillar of the genre they have come to love. Dune is every bit to science-fiction what Lord of the Rings is to fantasy."

        "text":"2021 Reread - 5* I was totally blown away by the recent movie version of this, that much so I decided to revisit and revaluate my opinion of this extraordinary book. So, I read it again six years on and this is something I said I would never do because I found it so difficult to read the first time. It wasn’t the complexity of the world and politics, but the narration style which totally perplexed and frustrated me. Though I think that was more to do with my immaturity as a reader at the time than anything else. This is a difficult one, but it’s worth it. This time I was impressed with everything: the intelligence of the writing, the details of the world and the intricate nature of the storytelling. There’s just so much brilliance here. And it’s entertaining. It’s interesting. The balance is perfect. The Freman culture is driven by ideas of ecology, efficiency and waste reduction. And whilst they are not without their faults, the sense of oneness and appreciation they have for their home planet is a strikingly important commodity. I found them fascinating to read about and of the many thing this novel has going for it, they are the jewel in Herbert’s crown. I want to see more of this world. Original Review (2015) - 3.5* I could never give Dune five stars because I really struggled to get into the novel in the beginning. It has taken me almost two months to read. This, for me, is a very long time to spend on a book. It took me so long to read because I found the writing style incredibly frustrating. I had to read whole chapters again so I could get the gist of the plot. This was more so in the beginning, which I found particularly hard to read because of the author’s way of shifting between the thoughts of multiple characters. I found this very annoying; however, I persevered over my initial despondency towards the writing, and plodded on through the book. I’m glad I did so because in the end I did come to really enjoy it. Indeed, the story is fantastic, but the writing will always remain unbearable for me. A truly brilliant plot Dune is to science fiction what The Lord of the Rings is to high fantasy; it is the novel that officially, and unarguably, defines the genre. The story begins with the house of Atreides accepting the Dukedom of the planet Dune. The former Baron has been ousted by the Emperor, and is no longer of consequence. Well, that is how it initially appears. Very early on it revealed that the whole thing is a political ploy to bring the house of Atreides to its knees. The Baron lies in wait, and is ready to strike against the new, and benevolent, approach the Duke uses on the Fremen. The Fremen are the natives of the dessert planet; thus, they know how to survive its harshness above all others. They do this through their frugal approach to water. They value it above all else, and will never waste a drop in earnest. The Baron Harkonnen, as a chide against the natives, squanders water in the cruellest ways. He, and his dinner guests, throw cups of water on the floor of the dinner hall; it was his tradition. The wasted water was soaked up with towels, which the Baron allowed the Fremen to suck the water out of. When the Duke enters he rejects this custom, and is more respectful to the Fremen way of life. He and his son and heir Paul, who is the protagonist of this novel, go as far as to try the Fremen’s grossly effective water saving suits. These Stillsuits, quite literally, recycle all the water the body wastes and feeds it back to its wearer. The Fremen way is the right way This early familiarity, with the Fremen technology, no doubt helps to keep Paul’s mind open when he is later forced to live amongst the Fremen. Paul is somewhat of a marvel; he is prophecy’s chosen one. When he eventually gains the trust of the Fremen they allow him to choose a Fermen name. He calls himself after their most revered prophet: Muad'Dib. They accept this and follow him as their leader. His inherited title of Duke dictates that he is their lord, but their religion determines their real loyalty. He has to, quite literally, fight for every ounce of their trust. Indeed, it does not come cheap, and will only be given to one who is a member of their people. “Without change something sleeps inside us, and seldom awakens. The sleeper must awaken.” Thus, Paul becomes their saviour. Consequently, he receives heaps of character development through this book. He goes form boy to the revered leader of a nation. The Fremen, like Paul, want the evil Baron Harkonnen gone from their planet. They do no want a cruel oppressor who is ignorant to their ways: they want Paul. I think the imagination behind the Fremen culture really is wonderful. They have efficiently adapted to survive their harsh planet. To emphasise this point you need only look at the fact that off-world humans live in fear of the giant Sandworms that infect the planet whereas the Fremen ride them as a coming of age ritual. Indeed, Paul has to ride a worm if the Fremen are to follow him. Deep characters The result of this is a very complex, and intriguing plot. I found the first third of this book to be very perplexing initially. This is a world we are told about rather than shown at the start. We hear about the Fremen but do not truly understand them till the very end. I was very overwhelmed at the beginning, and in all honesty I do think this novel merits a re-read to further establish my understanding of it. This did affect my rating because it inhibited by enjoyment of the book. “Deep in the human unconscious is a pervasive need for a logical universe that makes sense. But the real universe is always one step beyond logic.” Indeed, aside from Paul there is a whole host of dynamic, and well rounded, characters. His mother is to be the new revered mother of the Fremen people, which for someone of her age is quite remarkable. There is also the captain of Duke Leto’s household guard who is a very deep and honourable individual. As much as I came to like these characters I was still frustrated with the writing of them in the beginning. I found it difficult to read scenes in which up to four characters internal thoughts are portrayed alongside their dialogue. It wasn’t always clear who was thinking. I much prefer a narrative that is focalised through one person. Well, at least one person per chapter. Overall, I thought the idea behind this novel was utterly fantastic. However, my personal reaction to the writing style limited my overall enjoyment of the book. I do intend to read some of the sequels. However, I do not have any intention of doing so in the near future. Maybe, in a couple of years I will return to the brilliant, and annoyingly written, world of Dune. __________________________________ You can connect with me on social media via My Linktree . __________________________________"

        "text":"Seems as if they might be duned to be addicted to spice, all good old barbarians on magic mushrooms style. Quite dusty, especially regarding how to put the different parts of this behemoth series in the big picture of sci-fi because each part (of the 3 I´ve read so far and very probably won´t restart trying to read the 4th and 5th part) presents something different. Essentially, only this, the first one, is a real science fantasy epos, while the others are mostly circulating around the characters' special skills and family problems without much meta, plot, or different settings. Just this first milestone is big in the epic worldbuilding department and some other things I´ll try to point my primate fingers at. As unrealistic as water scarcity in such a highly developed galactic civilization seems, it´s a perfect explanation for creating the blue eyed mind mutants and the misandrist female breeding gang, that don´t ever need to kick male butts, because they preemptively avoid that situation to become real. Real life implications and innuendos. I don´t know if Herbert had any kind of real civilizations, cultures, or traditions in mind when he constructed the tribes, today it would probably fall under any kind of politically correct bigoted do gooder codex, but there could lie a ton of creative writing gold in exploring this question of how to implement any past or present movement, society, tradition, faith into different sci-fi subgenres. Because how the traditions, monsters, and badass special moves of the inhabitants influence the planetary and intergalactic trade and travel balance is slowly presented to the reader, while the impact of the wonderful spice expands its glow towards total domination. Don´t take drugs except they make you superhuman As so often, a prescription free pharmaceutical wonder cure can solve all of your problems until corporate interests come and ruin everything by using anything in their armory to get control over the precious resource of psychohistoric psi precognition power. The idea of one substance changing the whole balance of power of the galaxy is big in many sci-fi series and especially terrifying for each arrogant, high tech civilization, because an animal creating impervious shields, an immortality tonic, a mind altering super drug, etc., could enable far weaker, steampunky tribes to destroy them. Classic barbarian hordes on magic mushrooms looting Rome style. Bene Gesserit Who says that centuries long, epigenetic, elitist breeding programs have to be completely evil all the time? Except for the poor lovers aroused by the wrong, not arranged partner, stupid Romeo and Juliet syndrome complexes, you have to see the bigger picture and control your hormones and feelings and sacrifice some biochemical illusions to create the ÜberPsi mentat mentalist mind penetrator. However, it works with less evil too. Together with the spice, this elite mental mind control academy with the aim to finally create the ultimate space JC messiah figure to defecate rainbows, freaking galactic peace, pink unicorns, and gold, is the backbone of the whole trilogy, because impacts of both and the excessive use of it as MacGuffins and Chekhovs plot devices lead to the question: Is this still really sci-fi or not more a high fantasy thing with some sci-fi elements? Well, highly subjectively, yes, Dune is mostly psi fantasy dressed in futuristic clothes with some faith, tech, technobabble (rare), and trade in between, which makes it one of the most outstanding and unusual sci-fi works, I mean fantasy camouflaged as sci-fi. Tricky, one is so indoctrinated to call this thing sci-fi that it took me a reread and absorbing many reviews to realize what´s really going on. I´m really not sure about this whole thing, I´ve read a ton of sci-fi and my alien mind parasite, in a kind of perverted symbiosis with the xenovirus making me look fresher I deliberately bought for this purpose like a tapeworm therapy to lose weight (you don´t want to know what this costs on the alien bioweapons black market, the second half of my immortal soul exactly), tells me that there still would a lot of story without the sci-fi elements, while close to nothing would be there after removing fantasy, faith, drugs, and mind penetrating abilities, so, yea. I mean, even the planet itself doesn´t really has sci-fi fractions or something, the space around it is kind of empty without many sci-fi parties, cyborgs, aliens, everything substantial seen in close to any big sci-fi series. This leads me to An unpopular and possibly controversial opinion It could be that Herbert is, and I am just talking about the sci-fi aspect, a bit overrated or, let´s precisely define it, overhyped as a sci-fi author because he is more of a fantasy writer. This couldn´t happen in a fantasy world, because parts of the legions of readers of the genre don´t want aliens and Clarketech mixed in their magic, not to speak of the suspension of disbelief problem that often comes with sudden future tech elements in fantasy, that´s just disgusting. The other way round, as with Dune, is much easier, just put some sci-fi around fantasy and everything just rolls perfectly. Is terraforming destroying cultural heritage or making inhabitable worlds paradises? The ethical implications of this question are another sci-fi old school vehicle, especially if the terrible acid rain, high gravity, parasite infested, or dirty desert land is the only region where the special, red plotline device can grow and thrive. One could go so far as to ask if there are real life examples on earth, conservation vs corporate environmentalism, greenwashing and stuff (spoiler warning: conservation lost, earth is dying), and how this should be dealt with in decades, centuries, or millennia when we (I hope you are immortal too thanks to alien symbiont virus cooperation like me, if you aren´t, poor you, may I infect you? Just 20.000 of whatever your fringe financial system uses as fiat money that will be worthless as soon as natural apocalypse, mutually assured destruction, or alien invasion make it obsolete, and you get the parcel. Shipping not included.) start manipulating weather, geophysics and- chemistry, and climate of other worlds to make it sexy, tropical, tourist friendly paradises at the low cost of exterminating all alien life, but this would be a bit far fetched. Herberts´place in the sci-fi or sci-fa hall of fame. That´s tricky, especially because he just couldn´t keep delivering after the third part. I´ve played around with the fourth and fifth part, but had to abandon it because it escalated to too much unmotivated, philosophical drivel without a real plotline and a place in the big picture of the series, Herbert just didn´t manage to hold it all together. What made the first three parts, that they are kind of eccentric, ingenious standalones without the classic space opera series uniting plotline and style, great, kind of destroyed the rest of the series. Because he had no more vision for the meta, high sci fa elements, Herbert lost control over his own creation and just manufactured hearthless shells to sell more books. But that doesn´t mean that the first three parts aren´t milestones of the interdisciplinary genre, exploring it in new ways no one imagined before while reaching Lem-, Clarke-, and Asimov levels of subtle, intelligent dialogues, innuendos, connotations, and character driven development. It´s something unique, special, and definitively not for anyone because of its high entry barriers that may annoy some readers, but don´t let yourself be easily deterred by that, it´s totally worth it once you´re in and high as heck and addicted forever to the wonderful, delicious spice melange.

        "text":"Dune is often considered a masterpiece of 20th-century American science fiction. In part, the book owes its reputation to the film adaptation David Lynch directed in the early 1980s (although this movie was, and still is, not considered one of his best). Frank Herbert wrote a novel of epic proportions, in other words, a space opera , with its intergalactic feudal society, its decadent (if not evil) empire and its band of rebels: the book was published some ten years before the first instalment of the Star Wars series. Indeed, along with Asimov’s (overrated) Foundation stories, it was George Lucas’ primary source of inspiration. One of the most exciting aspects of Herbert’s creation is the multi-cultural world he depicts. Each house (Atreides, Harkonnen, etc.), each planet (Arrakis, Giedi Prime, Caladan...), each group (the Fremen, the Bene Gesserit, the Guild, the Emperor’s suite and the Sardaukars) has its specific flavour, its own culture, its language — the comprehensive index at the end of the book is utterly fascinating. For each of these cultures, Herbert borrowed traits from traditions (ancient or contemporary) he knew well in reality, especially from the Middle East. In particular, Paul Atreides \/ Muad’Dib’s story among the Fremen is redolent of the historical events around T.E. Lawrence and the Arab revolt against the Ottoman Empire. And Paul’s crusade on Arrakis is told, as though it were ancient history, in the chronicles by the Princess Irulan at the start of each chapter. Herbert describes his fictional world and characters in great detail, which contributes to the richness of his narrative, but I found these descriptions somewhat boring and, especially, the middle of the book is a bit dragging for that reason. In my view, the most impressive parts of this novel are the dialogues, where Herbert simultaneously reveals what the characters are saying and thinking. This technique lends a sense of duplicity and scheming to almost every interaction. Everyone is plotting one way or another so that the whole thing ends up being like a great Shakespearean play, with dialogues and asides, tyrants and pretenders. What confirms this impression is not only the theme of the exiled Duke (see As You Like It , King Lear , or The Tempest ), but also the repeated scenes of fencing duels throughout, with feints and poisoned tips: a clear allusion to the endings of Hamlet and Macbeth , for instance. Edit : A word about Denis Villeneuve’s new film adaptation of Herbert’s novel (part 1, 2021). Comparisons are odious and obviously wouldn’t be to David Lynch’s advantage. This is a Dune version for a new generation of fans and an epic movie on par with Peter Jackson’s Lord of the Rings trilogy, in the early 2000s. The settings (filmed in Scandinavia and the Middle East) are breathtaking, and the actors have so much going for them. But what strikes me the most in this new version is the sense that everything is overwhelming and sublime: the massive architecture, the crushing machines, the extreme weather conditions, the earth-shattering landscapes, the thunderous music, the tragic events, the repulsive foes. From the relenting waves of Caladan to the searing and unending skies of Arrakis, everything assumes an oceanic and staggering dimension."

        "text":"I blame the movie. I was an avid but novice fantasy and sci-fi reader in 1984 when David Lynch’s Dune rolled out as a big-budget adaptation of the 1965 classic book. It was an artistic and box-office failure with Roger Ebert calling it “a real mess, an incomprehensible, ugly, unstructured, pointless excursion.” Numerous references were made to its excessive length, particularly a tv edition that was over 3 hours long. I never did pick up the classic sci-fi book, assuming the commentary heard about the movie applied to the book. All that changed when I broke my finger and found myself with a lot of extra time on my hands (groan). Besides, sandworms. Dune has a lot of ingredients that don’t fit into my preferred stories, yet the gestalt was not only tolerable, but engrossing. It begins with the Atreides family preparing to shift their holding from their current home to the planet of Arrakis. The Emperor has given the Atreides the territory and trade on the planet of Arrakis, formerly under control of their enemies, the Harkonnen. The planet Arrakis is hot, arid and generally hostile to life. There is, however, a small population of native, fierce Freman who have managed to build an existence in the desert. Paul Atreides is the young heir of the family, and mystical testing reveals he might be the one prophesied. Paul undergroes a rapid growth curve, facilitated by his teacher Dr. Yeuh and his father’s advisors. But it is in the desert that Paul will discover his strength as well as his new people. Seriously, now. Honestly, I have to wonder how much of this like is generational. If Sanderson or Rothfuss wrote this book, two chapters in Dune would have made a whole book, and while detail may have been added, it likely would have made for a book as slow as the movie. I liked the scope of Dune, and that there is a resolution to the initial conflict. It is also interesting that despite the volume of concepts packed in here, with political maneuvers, terraforming, technology, cultural assimilation, and mysticism all playing roles that I didn’t find it overwhelming, perhaps because so much is genre-familiar. On the downside, it could have perhaps used a bit more transitions, particularly near the end when months at a time are skipped. Writing was solid; nothing really stood out, but it told the story well. There’s some vague mysticism that might irritate those who like explanations. It was a bit of an eye-roller to have the chief villain be a fat, gay, sadistic pedophile, but Herbert really isn’t thinking outside the trope character box much (it’s not enough that he sentences people to death but he has to be physically abhorrent? And gay?). World-building is fun, but standard desert. Overall, I’m glad that I finally took the time to read it and put those old assumptions to rest. I love a good hero."

        "text":"3.5\/5 Stars Dune oh Dune, seems like I need to raise my Shield Wall for this review. Dune is one of the most important pieces of literature for the Sci-Fi genre. I’ve been raking my brain for hours on how to properly explain the importance of Dune in the sci-fi literature but you know what? I dune (hehehe) think it’s necessary for me to do so. If you truly wanna know why, you can search it on whatever search engine you use and you'll find hundreds of articles or reviews on why this book is that important; and they’ll do a much better job than me. I won’t even deny any of them because, in my opinion, this book was truly revolutionary. Dune didn’t become the number one highest selling Sci-fi novel of all time for no reason; like Brian Herbert said, it is to Sci-Fi, what the LOTR trilogy is to fantasy. Theoretically, if I’m reviewing this by putting my head as someone from 1960’s or 1970’s, I know I would think of this book as my bible. 1965 was the year when Dune was published for the first time, 24 years before I was born. There are just too many groundbreaking ideas, world-building, that would become the inspirations for many Sci-fi in our time; I only realized this after reading this book. I mean, the gigantic Sandworm alone has inspired many video games to use it as a common monster or enemy. Picture: Dune by Marc Simonetti Desert planet, Stillsuits, space exploration, and Zen Buddhism, Dune was truly a groundbreaking novel, almost everything in this book somehow seems prophetic because it has predicted our current society, especially when it comes to faith, emotional control, empathy, and the importance of ecology and scarcity. “The mind commands the body and it obeys. The mind orders itself and meets resistance.” Part of what made this book was great for me was Herbert’s prose. I haven’t read enough classic to claim it was classical, but Herbert’s prose was definitely unique to me. It has a lot of freedom by writing it from a limited omniscient narrative; changing POV’s repeatedly in a single chapter without any warning. This is, honestly, one of my biggest pet peeves in my usual read, but Herbert made it work because all his characters were really well written, distinct in their personality, and the dialogues are really well dune (HEHEHE). Plus, there are so many motivational and extremely philosophical quotes that seem to make this book a combination of Sci-Fi & self-help book, such as: “It is so shocking to find out how many people do not believe that they can learn, and how many more believe learning to be difficult.” And of course, the most famous and one of the best quote I’ve ever read out of any book “I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.” I can’t believe I have gone through life without knowing about this litany against fear. It’s applicable in any kind of hardship we faced in real life, and I know it will be one of my motto starting from now. If I’m judging this book solely from how significant this book was, I’ll give it maximum score in a heartbeat. However, I’m reviewing this based on one question and how I rated all the books I read: was it enjoyable? The answer is yes and no, it was a mixed bag. The first part of this book was incredible, I couldn’t put down the book and everything was so interesting and compelling. Then comes the second part, where the pacing just became really draggy and somehow, boring. However, my hope was restored for a while during the third act, until the anti-climax happened. My expectation is obviously at fault here but hey, this book is the number one highest selling sci-fi book of all time and one of the most highly acclaimed book, I expected there to be a mind-blowing climax sequences to close the book in an epic way. But no, there wasn’t any. Not only it felt anti-climactic, Herbert’s prose in describing settings and actions didn’t age well or up to current standard. The main reason for this is that this is a book that relies heavily on character’s dialogues to do everything; world-building, plot, characterizations were done solely through dialogues. This leads to the great plot but weak action sequences and no vivid settings. Sure there was some explanation on the settings, but other than the planet—which is just a desert, just search Sahara or Planet Tatooine and voila—the interiors were given only brief description, which makes it hard to imagine; I had to look up some artworks to be able to immerse myself in the settings of the book. Overall, Dune was truly a revolutionary book for its time that is filled with tons of imaginative and fantastic ideas. Although there were some parts that disappointed me, I still liked the book and I finally understand why there are so much discussion and praises around this book. I recommend this to every Sci-fi fans for its importance and also, it’s good to know where most fantastic Sci-Fi you’ve read or you’re reading now got its idea from. However, this is also where I’ll stop with the series. You can find this and the rest of my Adult Epic\/High Fantasy & Sci-Fi reviews at BookNest"

        "text":"[UPDATED] I reread Dune for the first time in several decades and immensely enjoyed it. I also went back to watch the original cult feature film by David Lynch and had quite mixed feelings - while it was close to the overall aesthetic that Frank Herbert describes with the gorgeous desert sets and the terrifying worms, the parts of the story that were necessarily culled out was disturbing (that and the woeful special effects at the time trying (and IMHO failing) to visualize the personal shields that the characters wear in hand-to-hand combat). For those who are just discovering Dune for the first time, it is essentially a messianic story on a desert planet (think of Jesus or perhaps Mohammed on Tatooine) in a universe dominated by a cartel (the Guild also known as CHOAM) with a monopoly on a drug (called mélange) derived from a rare material (spice) available only on the desert planet Arrakis (Dune). This drug is so powerful that it allows the Guild (and later Maud'dib) to leverage space-time singularities to defy the speed of light and travel anywhere in the universe. Overlaid on this foundation, the epic battle of the feudal houses of the noble Atreides and the evil Harkkonen houses rages, the betrayal of the former by the latter explicitly endorsed by the Emperor (himself an almost impuissant pawn of the Guild as well). All that to say that the fabric of the story is multilayered and as complex and complete a universe as you will find in George RR Martin or Dan Simmons. There are several enhanced human species running around: the Mentats who have been cerebrally enhanced to be able to calculate like supercomputers (computers themselves having been banned!) and each then uses their predictive analytics for their assigned Dukes (or the Emperor) and the Bene Gesserit cult who are a sort of quasi-religious non-celibate nuns who have honed perception and language to the point of having developed nearly superpower-level strengths of persuasion which are almost universally feared and vilified as sorcery in the rest of the universe. Paul Atreides, heir to the throne, is born to Jessica, a Bene Gesserit, possessed some of these powers and when the family moves to Arrakis (part of the aforementioned Harkkonen plot) from their home planet Caladon, he appears to the native Freeman population as perhaps a fulfillment of their messianic prophecies and hopes. In perhaps the most critical departure from the book, the Lynch movie does not really show Paul questioning the awesome power that he possesses and his assumption of the mantle as the Arrakis Messiah, the Maud'dib (something that the 2021 film by Denis Villeneuve does thankfully address). In the book, one aspect that I loved was how Paul struggled with this messianic destiny and did everything he could to subvert it. One of the unique gifts he received, presumably as the rare and unique offspring of a Bene Gesserit, was the ability to see possible outcomes (like a Mentat) and thus he could take decisions based on the most likely foreseen outcome. It made for great reading. The other great thing about Dune is the aesthetic of this desert planet with impossibly huge worms under the surface who are mysteriously connected to spice and pose a danger to all creatures in the desert except for the Freeman. The still suit which recycles body water in the deep desert was brilliant as was the ever-present obsession with \"water debt\" of the Freemen. I really felt like I was walking unevenly (must not attract the worms!) through the sand with Jessica and Paul before their fateful encounter with the Freemen. Dune is a well-deserved classic for all the reasons I mentioned above and probably much more that I missed. I have read it twice and gotten almost entirely different things out of it each time. I have since read all the canonical Frank Herbert books in the series and enjoyed it all immensely. [UPDATE] I am looking forward to Denis Villeneuve's Dune in October 2021. The previews I have seen so far seem to be quite coherent with respect to the book. I was a fan of Lynch's Dune and am curious to see what Villeneuve does with this one. Feel free to comment below. [UPDATE] Villeneuve’s 2021 film covers half of the book and does a fantastic job as both an homage to Herbert’s book and Lynch’s film. The casting, costumes, CGI, and script are all top-notch. Dune lovers have every reason here for rejoicing. One key difference from the Lynch film is that we do not see the Guild Navigators, so we can hope that they show up in the second half! [UPDATE 2024] I loved the 2nd DV adaptation especially the use of color and black and white as well as character arcs. There were a few deviations from the original, but nothing as idiosyncratic as Lynch’s rain on Arakis In 1984. I can’t wait to see what he does with Dune Messiah.

        "text":"3.5\/5 Honestly, I never know exactly how to start my review after finishing a nearly nine hundred pages book, but I guess I'll start by saying that I definitely enjoyed it, but was it a life-changing reading experience? Unfortunately, not for me. This book is considered a classic of the science fiction genre, Frank Herbert did an amazing, or even one of a kind job, creating the entire universe in which Dune takes place, all the characters, descriptions and practically everything in this book was simply fascinating. I really wanted to be one of those people who closes this book and is completely in love with it, and then when someone asks if they've read it say \"Yeah, I love Dune, it's my favorite book.\" but as it turns out, I'm not that person. At least, yet. This is the first story in a six-volume series, so I hope that changes. Like I said, I liked it, but I genuinely think I would have loved it if I hadn't watched the movies. In my opinion, the movies are even a close-to-being-perfect adaptation of the Herbert’s work and pretty much everything that happened in the book also happened in the first two films - with some small changes and a few scenes were in a different order, but it didn't change the fact that I still very much enjoyed watching both of them. Dune I and Dune II, being great adaptations, unfortunately meant that watching them before reading the book wasn't the best idea as I was bored for most of the story because I just knew what was going to happen. The first four hundred pages took me the longest to read because I watched Dune I twice, but thankfully it took me much less to finish the rest. The beginning (read the said first four hundred pages) were hard to read - which may not be much of an incentive for those planning to start I know - but the second half of the book even got me hooked. Frank's writing style may not have been entirely to my liking, the \"wow, what's happening\" moments didn't shock me as much as I thought they would, but the characters were amazing so I have to thank them because they are the reason for me being invested. Jessica was definitely my favorite here, followed by Paul, which I know is a boring answer, but what can I say, I liked them. They may even have become my favorite son and mother duo in books, which says a lot considering I've read a lot of stories in my life. \"If you harm my son,” she said, “you’ll have me to meet. I call you out now. I’ll carve you into a joint of—\" “Mother.” Paul stepped forward, touched her sleeve. “Perhaps if I explain to Jamis how—” “Explain!” Jamis sneered.\" Finally ending my rant, because I didn't plan to write so much, which is basically still nothing, because you could talk and talk without the end about this book, but I definitely plan to continuing this series. Maybe I'll even manage to finish all six books this year, we'll see. I hope at least. —————— maybe I'll be able to read all six books by the time the next movie comes out (2027?) we'll see (I'm already having trouble with all the names)"

        "text":"I have to write this review without rhythm so that it won’t attract a worm. In the distant future Arrakis is a hellhole desert planet where anyone who doesn’t die of thirst will probably be eaten by one of the giant sandworms. It’s also the only place where the precious spice melange can be found so it’s incredibly valuable, and the honorable Duke Leto Atreides has been ordered by the Padishah Emperor to take over control of Arrakis from his mortal enemies, the House Harkonnen. While this seems like a great offer on the surface the Duke and his people realize that it’s actually a cunning trap being set by the Emperor and Baron Harkonnen. The only hope seems to be allying with the local populace called Fremen whose harsh environment has led them to become an incredibly tough and disciplined people, but they have their own vision of what Arrakis should be. They also have a prophecy about the coming of a messiah figure who will lead them to freedom, and the Duke’s son Paul looks like he may be exactly who they’ve been waiting for. This is classic sci-fi that really deserves the label. What Frank Herbert accomplished in one novel is stunning because he built a fascinatingly detailed universe in which the politics, religion, economics, espionage, and military strategy are all equally important. He then blended these more grounded concepts with bigger sci-fi ideas like being able to use spice to see through space-time, and the scope of that encompasses trying to pick the proper path through various potential timelines as well as free will vs. fate. I think one of the factors that helps this story stay timeless is that so much of it is based on what humanity becomes vs. trying to predict what futuristic technology would be like. This is a society that once had a war with machines and has since rejected any type of computers so people have developed to fill the gap with the help of the spice. The Mentats are trained to use data to predict outcomes. The Navigators of the Guild have used so much of the spice to help them move through space that they’re mutating. The all female Bene Gesserit have developed a variety of skills to place their members alongside positions of power to help advance their breeding scheme that spans generations. Herbert also cleverly came up with an excuse that explains why knives and hand-to-hand combat are so important with the idea of the personal body shields. So even though we still got a good sci-fi’s novel worth of cool gadgets the emphasis is on what the people can do and how that’s developed over a long period of time. It also adds a lot of depth to the political dimensions because all of these groups have different agendas that cause them all to mistrust each other, but because they all fill these various roles none can exist without the others. There are also parallels to our world that are still in play because the idea of a desert people caught up in the power struggles of various outsiders because of their valuable natural resource is an obvious allegory to the Middle East that still works today. Plus, the classic film Lawrence of Arabia came out a few years before Herbert published this, and you have to think that it had some influence on him because there are elements of the story that seem very much inspired by it. While the whole concept of a Chosen One has gotten a bit worn over time that’s not Herbert’s fault, and this is still a fantastic sci-fi story with big ideas that also works as space opera as well as being an epic adventure story."

Original Review 4 ⭐ A word of warning as you venture out to peruse the veritable smorgasbord of delectable reviews for this Sci-Fi\/Fantasy Classic! Be sure to do your Du(n)e diligence. Be wary of key phrases such as “I don’t usually read Fantasy\/Sci-Fi”, “Too many made-up words” or “I’m just reading before the movie comes out”. These individuals have come down with a bad case of bandwagonitis and any self-respecting Sci-Fier-er cannot count on their reviews being in any way accurate or beneficial! As I’m firmly placed in the 3rd category of Blockbuster-hungry fools, I’d advise you to immediately move on to another review, there’s nothing of value here. In fact, I won’t actually be writing a review, I’ll simply address one simple question: What is Dune? Dune is sand as far as the eye can see. Dune is the sphincter opening.... of a desert tent. Dune is thirst. The distillate esthers of reclaimed waste; the sour effluvia of humanity. It is greedily, no… joyously sipping your overweight Uncle’s recycled knacker sweat in a desperate effort to quell the rapid loss of your own bodily fluid. Dune is the Water of Life; Molecular Modification; a Transcendental Trinocular Acid Trip. The [Boy] with Kaleidoscope Eyes experiencing a Psychokinesthetic extension of self. Dune is the middle-aged man who, on hearing praise for his young sons, must always exclaim \"I taught them everything they know!\" Dune is defiance of fear. Dune is an unsettling change in POV turned familiar, insightful friend. Dune is saying very little with a great many words. Dune is Pardot Kynes, micro-ecology, patience and long-term goals. Dune is the Shai-Hulud; the scandalous straddling of a worm. Dune is religion, planted and shaped to the needs of the latest conquests and heraldic symbols. Dune is the Ghost Wind of the Jihad Dune is Alia, is Stewie Griffin. Dune is Feyd-Rautha, is Commodus playing Gladiator. Dune is a feint, within a feint, within a feint. Dune is the house Atreides, is the Greek house Atreus. Dune is the Kwisatz Haderach; the Messiah; a planet afflicted by a Hero. Dune is power and wisdom at the cost of humanity; Friendship lost to worship. ”Everything he touched brought death and grief… it was like a disease that could spread across the universe… How little the universe knows about the nature of real cruelty!”"

        "text":"When the epic and ensemble cast movie of Dennis Villenevue is about to release, I decided to choose this fantastic and also one of my favorite cult sci-fi series as flashback Saturday reading! ( it looks better than David Lynch- Kyle MacLachlan version but the looks may be deceiving! At least Timothy and Zendaya look so cool in those stylish clothes and grimy expressions on their faces) After nearly three decades later, holding this paperback into my hands is magical experience take me a time travel: my mom was banging on my room’s door and telling me go outside and be social, getting some tan, instead of self-isolating myself by burying my head into books for days and feeding myself with junk food! ( the past mom had no idea, billions of people in the earth will be forced to do the similar things I’ve done in 2020 because of different reasons . At least the 2020-me did exactly same things with one difference: I threw boozes into equation! ) When I reread the series I clearly understand why I became addicted to the them( I’m talking about entire books) Firstly you find yourself drawn into this journey after reading few pages because Herbert’s storytelling skills are extraordinarily. The meaningful interludes, the character development, the impressive world building transform you to the other universe that you never want to leave. The awakening parts of Paul who discovers his own abilities, epic dynasty battles, ominous sand worms , intrigues, revenge, mind games present us a perfect blend of political economical, sociological, theological themes. I advise you to read the books first to understand the deeply ideological messages and unique philosophy of the series because sometimes the screenwriters have hard time to absorb and reflect the entire soul of the book! At least by reading the main story by yourself, you may directly reach to the core! Here are my favorite quotes of the book: “I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.” “Deep in the human unconscious is a pervasive need for a logical universe that makes sense. But the real universe is always one step beyond logic.” “The mystery of life isn't a problem to solve, but a reality to experience.” “When religion and politics travel in the same cart, the riders believe nothing can stand in their way. Their movements become headlong - faster and faster and faster. They put aside all thoughts of obstacles and forget the precipice does not show itself to the man in a blind rush until it's too late.” “Hope clouds observation.” “It is impossible to live in the past, difficult to live in the present and a waste to live in the future.” “Fear is the mind killer.” “Once men turned their thinking over to machines in the hope that this would set them free. But that only permitted other men with machines to enslave them.”"

        "text":"TW: pedophilia and rape off page Although this is discussed as a highly influential work in scifi, now having read it, I do think we have evolved past the need for this to be part of the canon. This book was a bit of a mess with the characters, world, and plot all feeling a bit disjointed and half baked. The world, while interesting and obviously very detailed, is barely explained to the reader and relies heavily on the appendix without actually providing context in the story (with the exception of a few things like spice and the worms). These characters all felt a little flat and\/or underutilized. The plot felt like two separate books, while being peppered with themes of glorifying colonialism, white saviors, and lack of agency for most of the women. Although I understand that is a product of when it was written, it still points to how there are much better works that have been written since even if they were influenced by this. I’m interested to see what they do with the movie adaptation. I’ll have a review and discussion on my channel coming up."

        "text":"Completely Different Tone Than Dune #1 Dune #1 leaves us in a complete cliffhanger. However, Dune #2 starts up 12 years later. In the introduction to the version that I read, Brian Herbert (the author’s son) wrote that one magazine labeled this book as the “disappointment of the year.” However, he explained the book is supposed to show how absolute power can corrupt leaders including Paul Atreides. Dune Messiah has a completely different tone than Dune. Dune was filled with adventure and hope, the entire group working, willing to die, to transform the environment. Further, Dune had a bunch of very strong female characters. In contrast, Dune Messiah is more political and emotional. Also, the depiction of women is just horrible. Alia is boy crazy, and Irulan and Chani are only focused on Paul and producing an heir. In 12 years, Paul has matured. He is not the boy of Dune. He makes decisions almost cavalierly. The book was definitely entertaining though. The audiobook had an entire cast of characters, and it was such a rich experience. As with Dune, I could pick something up new each time reading Dune Messiah. However, the tone on this was much darker than Dune, and it wasn’t inspiring. The ending of Dune Messiah was so weak, the complete opposite of the ending of Dune. Recently, I was reading a list ranking all of the Dune books, and this one was rated the very worst of the series so I am still excited to continue with this series and hope that the future is a little less bleak. 2025 Reading Schedule Jan\tA Town Like Alice Feb\tBirdsong Mar\tCaptain Corelli's Mandolin - Louis De Berniere Apr\tWar and Peace May\tThe Woman in White Jun\tAtonement Jul\tThe Shadow of the Wind Aug\tJude the Obscure Sep\tUlysses Oct\tVanity Fair Nov\tA Fine Balance Dec\tGerminal Connect With Me!

        "text":"Only half the length of the original Dune , the second book in the series takes place 12 years after. Not as epic, this is almost like a chamber western, with political intrigue and references to great goings on, but little action described. The feel of the book is like a prelude to what comes next, that the third book will be the true sequel to Dune. For fans of Dune, no doubt, and you really need to have read Dune first, to know the characters and to at least have a clue about Herbert's complex and intricately detailed world building. But then, comparing this book to Dune is like comparing a country lawyer to a Supreme Court justice, the comparison itself is unfair, very few books will equal Dune or even come close. Dune Messiah is part of Herbert's great vision and is a good book in its own right. *** 2019 Reread Coming back to this book years later and after having read all of the first six that Frank Herbert, I have a better appreciation for Herbert's great vision. Describing a conspiracy against Paul after his conquest of the Universe, and devastation of myriad worlds and billions of lives lost, the author creates a setting of disquiet, as Leto's time in the Dune universe begins. Herbert's literary grasp of theology, ideology and spiritualism is on full display and this is an important book in his canon."

        "text":"‘ I live in an apocalyptic dream. ’ When the wheels of fate are churning, can you escape without being crushed beneath its wheels. Frank Herberts set up an amazing and complex political universe and sets it to explode, sending us off on a trajectory picked up by Dune Messiah . Set 12 years after the events of Dune , we find Paul Maud’dib on the Emperors throne and the Jihad has ‘ killed sixty-one billion, sterilised ninety planets, completely demoralised five hundred others ’ all in Paul’s name. Messiah has vastly expanded mechanics yet resides in a much smaller scale than its predecessor, being almost a parlor drama of ‘ plots within plots within plots ’ as before but with a more focused proximity to really feel the tension creaking through the narrative. Expanding on themes of the ways religion and politics are manipulated for power and diving deep into ideas of fate and freedom with a touch of Friedrich Nietzsche along the way, Dune Messiah is a tense and psychological thriller that really drives home the ideas left open at the end of the previous novel and charts a course for incredible new directions for the larger narrative. While the original Dune plays out on epic proportions, Messiah feels more like a Greek tragedy. Withing a few chapters of the opening we see the plot drop into the chamber and be fired off with a pretty clear indication what it leads, yet every step of the way still feels fresh and thrilling. This is in keeping with the story as well, seeing as Paul foresees much of what is coming but after a decade of winning and no surprises, a psychological challenge that could be unexpected is what he craves. ‘ He felt chained to a future which, exposed too often, had locked onto him like a greedy succubus, ’ Herbert writes, and Paul, feeling isolated from even those he loves due to his prescience while increasingly speaking with Alia on their shared struggle, begins to wish for a way to escape his all-knowing fate. This becomes increasingly tragic when he can see great loss before they happen and the only advice his sister can give is ‘ we must not grieve for those dear to us before their passing ’ The story feels a bit more loose and less tidy in this one, an obvious difficulty when constructing a narrative around prescience. Yet the political tensions and plottings keep it sharp and direct, and where Herbert really excels is getting into character’s heads during discussions and seeing the internal mastermining going on. This is especially exciting with Scytale, a Tleilaxu Face Dancer that can shift into any body because if Bene Gesserits weren’t enough, this shapeshifting class only hinted at before is now on full conniving display to remind you that the Dune universe is terrifying and awesome. It is a tight cast, with less than a dozen primary characters including the return of Duncan Idaho as a clone, or ‘ghola’, also going by the name Heyt. Which, as expected, becomes an issue with the Fremen who see technology such as this as potentially blasphemous. Scytale warns ‘ reason is the first victim of strong emotion ’ and much of Messiah is mental chess full of strong emotions to throw Paul off his game. It’s pretty dark, considering he knows Duncan has been sent to probably kill him and it’s his friend yet not his friend at all as boisterous Duncan is now a stoic and pensive intellectual. ‘ Truth suffers from too much analysis. ’ -Ancient Fremen Saying Messiah seems hellbent on reminding you that the events of Dune were not a heroic and great thing but a pretty twisted political contest of colonialism, manipulation and mass murder. Like murder on the galactic scale of genocide. The Jihad is not awesome and people are starting to talk about that. The opening pages are an intense interview with a historian about to be executed for writing a critical historical analysis of Paul and his rise to power, and he tells the Fremen ‘ you learned early to call the truth heresy. ’ The ruling powers dismiss anything not in keeping with their narrative, one held firmly together by the glue of religion. ‘ Religion, too, is a weapon, ’ Herbert writes, and asks us ‘ what manner of weapon is religion when it becomes the government? ’ We begin to see the religious gaslighting to keep a strong and obedient population ready to kill. ‘ They are not mad. They're trained to believe, not to know. Belief can be manipulated. Only knowledge is dangerous. ’ What seems most dangerous is the knowledge of what is to come and the lack of freedom to escape fate. This novel delves deeper into ideas of memory as well as looking to the future with characters like Alia that have memory accessible in her cells to converse with the ancestral past. It becomes very existential, with question if there is any agency to truly make choices, locked into political decisions as well as the awareness of the future. Paul is set up much like the Nietzschean Übermensch yet in this novel he rejects it and wishes to escape it. ‘ My steps fit into it so precisely that I fear most of all I will grow bored reliving the thing so exactly, ’ he says, which also feels a nod to Nietzche’s concept of Eternal Return . What unfolds is brilliant and becomes an excellent example of refusing the body for the myth. While the end is sad and tragic, it is also a cementing of immortality as the eternal Maud’dib, now more legend and legacy than ever before. Messiah is a shorter sequel that packs a lot of power on the smaller scale while managing to make the universe vastly larger and more complex. There is much distrust stirred in this book, with distrust in rulers, history and religion being a major purpose for Herbert. In an essay by his son, Brian Herbert , he mentions how his father saw the Watergate scandal as a positive: ‘ By amplified example, albeit unwittingly, the thirty-seventh president of the United States taught people to question their leaders. ’ This message of questioning leaders, especially ones who impose moral codes through religion and seek to dismiss critical historical perspectives as execution-worthy heresy is at heart in Messiah . Legacy and fate are critical themes, as well as breeding schemes that will determine the future ruler of Arakkis. This is an excellent passing of the torch that slingshots us towards the next book, and the Dune series marches on. 4\/5 ' If you need something to worship, then worship life - all life, every last crawling bit of it!

        "text":"3.5 * I read Dune 9 years ago, thought it was perfect and left it there. Since then, I’ve debated whether I should read the follow up. I had two fears, one, that it would not be as good as the 1st in the series and, two, that things will go very badly for Paul and his Jihad. I was right on both accounts. On Saturday, I saw Dune 2 which was a masterpiece. In its aftermath, I was elated and then I felt a deep sadness and emptiness. When I read that Villeneuve almost finished the script for the 3rd Part, I decided to take the plunge and read Dune Messiah. I am content with my decision, although it wasn’t as good as the first and I felt depressed all the time I was reading it. “No matter how exotic human civilization becomes, no matter the developments of life and society nor the complexity of the machine\/human interface, there always come interludes of lonely power when the course of humankind, the very future of humankind, depends upon the relatively simple actions of single individuals.” This review contains spoilers for Dune and minor ones for this novel. Many complained that this is a boring book and that nothing happens in it. I fully disagree. Oh, the novel has problems but not these ones. I mean, ok, if you expect epic battles, you won’t find them in here. What you will find are plots over plots and a lot of internal struggle. It was not boring, I mean you do not need a large attention span to finish this book. It is a lot shorter than its predecessor and a fast read. The novel starts 12 years after the events in Dune. Paul Atreides is now the Emperor, the most powerful man in the Universe and he feels very, very unhappy and guilty. “To endure oneself may be the hardest task in the universe. There’s no writ of inquest or calling of witnesses to provide answers. No servant—or disciple—can dress the wound. You dress it yourself or continue bleeding for all to see.” At around 40%, we find the hard facts of his discontent: “Statistics: at a conservative estimate, I’ve killed sixty-one billion, sterilized ninety planets, completely demoralized five hundred others. I’ve wiped out the followers of forty religions”. A feat hard to achieve in terms of destruction. His only comfort is that “he had seen enough alternate Timelines to know of worse possibilities than accepting godhead for himself. Much worse.” “You can’t stop a mental epidemic. It leaps from person to person across parsecs. It’s overwhelmingly contagious. It strikes at the unprotected side, in the place where we lodge the fragments of other such plagues. Who can stop such a thing? Muad’Dib hasn’t the antidote. The thing has roots in chaos. Can orders reach there?” Paul is not the only one with issues. Many of the remaining powers try to kill him and even part of the Fremen are unhappy about the way their world changed, now that they have time to think. “Empires do not suffer emptiness of purpose at the time of their creation. It is when they have become established that aims are lost and replaced by vague ritual.” The Bene Gesserit Reverent mother, Scytale, a face Dancer Bene Tleilax, a guild navigator and empress Irulan meet to plot against Paul. They sent him a gift, a Ghola, a sort of clone made of Duncan Idaho’s dead flesh. They somehow program it to kill Atreides when activated. Paul is unable to refuse to have his childhood friend beside him, even though the ghola retains no memory of his past life. At the same time both Empress Irulan, Chani, the consort are desperate to sire a hire to the throne. Irulan feeds Birth control to Chani in secret while Muad’dib refuses to touch his wife. I confess that I’ve read the plot before starting. I wanted to know what I was getting into, my own power of prescience. Already knowing the plot, it allowed me to concentrate on the writing. I was able to enjoy the philosophic dialogues that I also appreciated in the original Dune, but also to see the problems. By far, the biggest issue I have with this book is how the author wrote women and all the nauseous sexual innuendoes concerning Alia. I will elaborate for each character because it pissed me off. I was surprised by these choices since Dune had some powerful women. •\tIrulan: She was present only at the beginning to moan that she wasn’t getting it from Paul and that she wanted a child so badly. So much so that she decided to conspire with the enemy. •\tChani: Poor woman is only a cardboard character here, a submissive thing and only a vessel for Muad’Dib’s heir. I remember that she had some sort of personality in the novel so I was very disappointed. •\tJessica: The powerful Jessica decided she has done enough and retired on Caladan, letting her offspring to ruin the world without her. She only sent a pointless letter This is so unlike Jessica to stay behind and not try to scheme. •\tThe Reverend Mother had some interesting interventions until she suggested that Paul and his sister should mate to produce a suitable heir from a genetic point of view. Later, she is brought back for a diatribe against IVF. It really reminded me that this book was written in the 60’. Or it could have ben set in Alabama. •\tAlia. Ok, I will try to write this without puking. In this book Alia is 15, going on 16 and apparently on heat. At some point, the author makes her fight naked and when Paul sees her, he realizes that she became a woman and almost gets a hard-on. Grose. And then there is talk about finding her a mate, later she feels a “post-coital sadness” and so on. Oh, and Duncan kisses her. I understand that she has the memories Jessica and all the Reverend Mothers before her but still, she looks like a 15 year old girl. WTF Herbert? The parts involving Paul, his internal struggles, the dialogues with his friends and enemies were all good, some excellent. They touched me and I felt sorry for him. I wanted to absorb some parts of this book inside me. However, I could not understand some of the author’s decisions. Well, as Paul said “There are problems in this universe for which there are no answers,” Paul said. “Nothing. Nothing can be done.” Some more quotes: The flesh surrenders itself, he thought. Eternity takes back its own. Our bodies stirred these waters briefly, danced with a certain intoxication before the love of life and self, dealt with a few strange ideas, then submitted to the instruments of Time. What can we say of this? I occurred. I am not … yet, I occurred. “We must not grieve for those dear to us before their passing.” “Before their passing,” Paul whispered. “Tell me, little sister, what is before?” All it required was water … and love. Life changed those irascible wastes into shapes of grace and movement, he thought. That was the message of the desert. Contrast stunned him with realization. He wanted to turn to the aides massed in the sietch entrance, shout at them: If you need something to worship, then worship life—all life, every last crawling bit of it! We’re all in this beauty together!"

        "text":"It´s mainly a psychological warfare battle with psi weapons, many conspiracies, less action, and very good dialogues. Some favorite elements: Sci-Fi pregnancies are always a fertile ground for plot ideas, bad pun intended, and as each mother of any species and epoch wants the best for the unborn and has the healthiest diet possible, there is one question that comes with pregnancy enhancing drugs and magical substances turning embryos in mentalists. Especially when pimping the baby in the womb is totally safe and nothing can go wrong anymore or each complication and problem can immediately be solved thanks to very advanced future medicine, the mother loses the legitimation to refuse any optimization possible, because it would actively harm the child by reducing the chances in the future and in competition with others, something already in discussion regarding genetic engineering nowadays. If it´s magic powder and its quality and quantity that decide over the future career of the child as a doctor, engineer, or god-emperor, it´ a bit trickier to find the right amount, because there are no mini- and nanobots patrolling the body scanning around. You know, I guess even fictional characters´ bodies might have different tolerances and biochemistries so how does a woman decide how much is too much and will the eyes of the kid glow too blue or too less and is a too less even desirable if it includes lower potential? If it´s already shining trough the womb during pregnancy, it might be just the right dosage. The world with shapeshifters, clones, psi powers, breeding programs, and intrigues that are distilled in a much smaller area than in the first novel, intensifying the suspense of so many different fractions competing with another. Philosophical, political, social, ethical, and moral questions in vast amounts, I would like to know how many books and ideas Herbert used to create the philosophy of the world and its protagonists and would be interested in a list of the references and how he modified and changed all the ideas, there is certainly a wiki, Reddit, or blog dealing with this. Diving deeper in this second dimension of the story might only be possible when rereading or regularly stopping while reading to reflect on what has just been said and to try to put it in the context of the whole story. It was so cool and could have been much longer, everything is perfect here and there would have been the potential for double the size with all the suspenseful elements and open questions. And the dialogues, it´s not often the case that there is something to read like that, so go for it.

        "text":"So I thought Dune was the best thing since the bound codex, right? And I read it about five times over the course of my young-adulthood. And then I read Messiah and was pretty much completely dissatisfied. Not enough to give it a poor rating, since it is interesting (I mean, we all still care about Paul, even if he is a whiner) and it did keep my attention. You haven't seen foreshadowing until you've read Dune Messiah . It takes that to a whole new, grotesque level. And pretentiousness. Thought Dune was pretentious? Hah! This one makes Dune look like a chimney-sweep in comparison. It's as though Frank Herbert managed to make a blunt weapon out of pretentiousness and use it directly on the reader's mind. My final impression was of just another massive philosophical acid trip consisting of a bunch of people smarter than me bandying hints and portentous minutiae in the middle of a half-realized desert wonderland for over three hundred pages. And I didn't really care about Duncan Idaho, anyway, since he was only in Dune for like forty pages and he only spoke about twice. Telling me ten times in a row that Paul really really liked Idaho is not going to make me feel the same way about him, Frank Herbert! Now I'm afraid to read number three."

So, last time I had my family murdered by our hereditary enemies I went into hiding in the desert too, and linked up with the tough native fighters there. I mean, who wouldn't? Since I had psychic powers, it seemed pretty crazy not to use them to gain some respect. Before I knew what had happened, I was the clan's leader. And you get some momentum, you want to keep it up, otherwise you just go backwards. Suddenly I found I was ruling the planet. I didn't expect it to be quite so easy to conquer the known Universe, but that bit always catches you by surprise. On the way, I met this girl. I liked her, she liked me, well, you know how these things happen. She gets pregnant. Then, shit, I go and of course lose my sight in some kind of nuclear attack. I'm just kicking myself for being so careless. Girlfriend dies in childbirth, par for the course, and since she has twins all my psychic powers are gone. I keep meaning to find out why that happens, but I never get round to it.

About half the size of the original, it feels like a simply bridge to Children of Dune than an actual sequel to Dune. But the theme of the story is one that Frank Herbert must have believed personally and that is Think For Yourself. People are not gods. Gods are not governance. To deify politicians and world leaders is a can of worms that should never be opened. Fans of the original fell in love with Paul Atreides and to see him essentially as a flawed leader with clay feet left a bitter taste in many mouths. So, again, it's easy to understand the criticism. It's like if Empire Strikes Back came out and Luke turned out to be just some dude who was more lucky than gifted. I’ll always recommend reading Messiah and Children of Dune together. Because as a stand alone, Messiah vanishes under the vast shadow cast by its predecessor."

The fact that although I like the plot and the main characters, Herbert's writing style makes me so detached from it all that after a while everything I like here, suddenly becomes dull. The beginning of the second part of Dune was even engaging and I was drawn into the story, but to enjoy the rest I have to like the writing, which is not the case here. Unfortunately, I'm one of those readers where if the writing style doesn't suit me, the rest probably won't either. It took me days to finish the three-hundred-pages book, which usually takes me a day or two when I like the story. I think that in itself shows how much I enjoyed it. I must admit that the ending made me want to continue it, but I think I should take a short break from the world of Dune, because sadly for me this is not the type of series that I could binge read in a week. Maybe these are the type of books that I need to savor slowly to understand them better, or just like them more, I honestly don't know, but despite my low rating here, I will probably continue this series one day, when the right time comes."

        "text":"Having re-read Dune (and reviewed it here on GR) recently, I figured I should continue and read at least the initial trilogy with Dune Messiah and Children of Dune to get a better idea of the world that Frank Herbert created. I am glad that I read Dune Messiah. It is an excellent novel about destiny and fate and how much of it we can control. We get more insight into the Navigators - here I noticed that, unlike in Dune, we actually meet a Navigator (one of the three primary conspirators against Paul Maud'dib) which means that David Lynch most have read this book as well before making his cult classic movie of the first book. We also learn more about the Bene Geserits and the Mentats. I found it particularly fascinating that the Butlerian Jihad, which takes place a few hundred years before the action in Dune and Dune Messiah, was actually, if I understood correctly, a war of humans against machines which the humans won. Following this victory, computers were banished from the known universe and instead Mentats and Navigators (inspired by melange made from spice) were bred to be human computers for political and financial strategy in the former case, and for navigation in space-time for the latter. This fascinated me because I have read and watched so much science fiction where the machines win (or are winning) such as in Ghost in the Shell or Neuromancer, or Blade Runner, or Hyperion and Dune is one of the rare universes where humans won and yet, at what cost? Banning machines seems to have brought humans back to a medieval society with its aristocracies (House Corrino, House Harkkonen, House Atreides) and oppression and genetic manipulation (Bene Gesserit). And once the Fremen rally around Paul to destroy two of the three houses and install Paul as the new Emperor and as the Dune Messiah, is this new regime really a new start for humanity or just another autocratic regime. It sure looks like that latter and we get inklings of this as the Fremen go spread the Gospel of their Maud'dib and subsequently spilling not just a little blood. All of these things continue to torture Paul as they did in Dune and yet he is inevitably driven forward by this messianic destiny. Enter the conspiracy of a Bene Gesserit priestess, a rogue Navigator and a strange Face Dancer who want to topple Paul's regime, well more specifically kill his Fremen wife and force him to sleep with his sister Alia (ewww!!) so as to continue the genetic engineering project and re-install the old regime over which each had more control than under Paul. Another piece of the puzzle here is the reappearance of Duncan Idaho, mentor and friend to Paul as a Zensunni master which has unintended consequences. Zensunnism in itself is a fascinating blend of Sunni Islam and Zen Buddhism that also is followed by the Freman. In essence, Herbert created a universe where classic monarchal hegemonies come into conflict with religious fanatics - in a sense we can see the Fremen hordes as marauding Zen Buddhist priests in ancient Japan fighting the Emperor, well that is one image that came into my mind anyway, so as not to wear out the old Western capitalism vs Islamic obscurantism trope. While perhaps less expansive and mind-blowing than the first Dune, Dune Messiah still delivers punches as a great plot with convincing characters and lots of philosophical questions. On to Children of Dune! I have since finished the whole canonical series and enjoyed all of it. [UPDATE] I am looking forward to Denis Villeneuve's Dune in October 2021. The previews I have seen so far seem to be quite coherent with respect to the book. I was a fan of Lynch's Dune and am curious to see what Villeneuve does with this one. Feel free to comment below.

        "text":"I really liked Frank Herbert's classic science fiction novel Dune when I first read it a few months ago --so much so that I named it one of the best books I read that year. But upon finally getting around to the sequel, Dune Messiah I'm pretty disappointed. It's really boring. Don't get me wrong, I can see some of the impressive literary clockwork that Herbert assembles in the book. Where Dune told the story of Paul Muad’Dib's rise to the Emperor, controller of the universe's only source of the coveted super spice \"melange,\" and general badass dude, Messiah tells the story of his downfall. It also follows through on one of the more interesting concepts introduced in the first book: Paul's spice-induced ability to foresee the eventual species-wide extinction of humans and the hard choices he has to make in order to steer history towards a lesser evil. Indeed, Messiah fast forwards to a point where Paul's fanatic followers have propagated a holy war that has destroyed entire planets and left over 60 billion people dead in just a few years. By those measures, Paul is the worst monster history has ever created, yet he has to bear the mostly private burden of knowing that he's killing all those people to save the race as a whole while simultaneously trying to outmaneuver his political opponents and crafty assassins. Angst! The problem I have with Messiah is that it suffers acutely from a kind of talking head syndrome. It's not until the back sixth or so of the book that anything interesting happens. Dune had sword fights, skirmishes, Paul and his mother tromping around the deadly desert of Arakis meeting and learning about the Fremen, and all other kinds of adventures. Messiah devotes literally dozens of pages at a time to sitting in a room listening to conspirators talk to each other. And then talking about what the talking means. And then thinking about what the talking about the talking means. It's terrible and jarring to see how Herbert has switched gears so abruptly from fascinating adventure and world building to stark exposition and naval gazing. Not that some of the ideas aren't interesting. The way that Paul must grapple with his precognition and how he has to grasp at things to try and leave humanity on the path to survival in the wake of his inevitable fall is a complex and fascinating idea, for one. And I liked the idea of how his strengths are the things that ultimately do him in --sometimes literally. It's just that I wish Herbert had found ways to make this story less tedious in its execution. Is the third book any better? I'm on the fence at this point."

        "text":"Buddy read with Athena ! \"Once more the drama begins.\" - The Emperor Paul Muad'dib on his ascension to the Lion Throne Twelve years have passed since the Battle of Arrakeen, where Paul Atreides wrestled the Imperium from the hands of the Padishah Emperor, and seized the Lion Throne for himself. Dune has become the political and economical centre of the universe, and the Qizarate priesthood has spread Muad'dib's name throughout space and turned him into not only an emperor with absolute power, but a god in his own right. Yet there are those who would topple the god emperor from his religious throne. In the grand circles of power, a new conspiracy arises from the shadows. Its goals and ambitions are many, and it seeks to infiltrate the ranks of the Atreides and the Fremen, striking at those closest to the emperor in order to remove him from power. And each step brings its plans closer to succeeding. \"Mysterious, lethal, an oracle without eyes, Catspaw of prophecy, whose voice never dies!\" Dune Messiah is, in many ways, even better than Dune . It cannot stand up to the wonder of discovering the world of Arrakis for the first time, but it certainly has other strengths. The setting and the writing style is mostly the same as in the first book. The story though, has changed dramatically. The first book is about Paul Atreides and his quest for vengeance against those who betrayed his family and seized their land. The second book is about managing an empire and protecting it from a devilishly dangerous conspiracy who shuns no means to achieve what they want. There is more political maneuvering, more hidden agendas, and more excitement for the reader. The character have also grown more interesting in the second book. Paul, Chani and Irulan are all older and more experienced in the games of power, and were much more enjoyable to read about than they were in the first one. And perhaps the most fascinating character of them all is Alia, Paul's sister. Still only fifteen years of age, she is both a Reverend Mother of the Bene Gesserit, a leader of the Qizarate priesthood, and a powerful voice in the Imperial Council. What truly made me decide to let this book keep the five stars from the first time I read it, was the ending. I will not go into details about it, but only say that this may be the most beautiful ending I have ever read in a sci-fi or fantasy book ever. For those of you who have read Dune and are debating with yourselves whether or not to read its sequels, I hope this review will be helpful in deciding. For those of you who haven't read any of the books from this universe, know that it is in my eyes one of the greatest fictional series of all time. I would definitely recommend it to every single one of you, because it's a wonderful story with few equals in the world of science fiction. Such a rich store of myths enfolds Paul Muad'dib, the Mentat Emperor, and his sister, Alia, it is difficult to see the real persons behind these veils. But there were, after all, a man born Paul Atreides and a woman born Alia. Their flesh was subject to space and time. And even though their oracular powers placed them beyond the usual limits of time and space, they came from human stock. They experienced real events which left real traces upon a real universe. To understand them, it must be seen that their catastrophe was the catastrophe of all mankind. This work is dedicated, then, not to Muad'dib or his sister, but to their heirs - to all of us. - Dedication in the Muad'dib Concordance as copied from The Tabla Memorium of the Mahdi Spirit Cult"

        "text":"When I first read Dune Messiah , it was nearly twenty years ago and like a lot things time had erased most of the details from my brain - including the ending. So digging into it last week was a treat; felt like something new. From re-discovering characters and themes, to gaining an understanding that my seventeen-year-old brain wasn't able to yet comprehend. As a note on my assessment style: Part of me wants to respond to other reviewers here on Goodreads concerning their literary criticisms. However, I’ve found that to be a self-defeating endeavor. I come from the school of: A review should stand on its own merits. But I have a little cheat here - I can respond to what my younger self thought of Dune Messiah . The Nick West of twenty years ago did have some criticisms of this book that may have been rooted in misunderstanding — and at the very least, a sense of disappointment or superb literary let-down. As I respond to Nick of the 90s, you can parallel similar themes in other 2 and 3 star reviews on this site. So here we are: You the reader, Nicholas at age 37, and Nick at age 17. Let’s chat. **(There is one specific thing I do want to address concerning other reviews, because it’s a weirdly specific critique that pops up a bunch of times. But we’ll get there in a minute.)** Off the top here, I loved this book. I had it on my Goodreads for 10 days, but really I ate up the bulk of the text in a three day page-burner. Here’s something that Nick, age 17, could not fully realize about Dune Messiah : This is a novel for grown ups. Gone is the fairy-tale magic of a young man forced into extraordinary circumstances. Gone are any aspects to the beginnings of the hero’s journey. Instead, we get the biggest realization that Nicholas at age 37 has had about the Dune series: Those aspects of fantasy and science fiction tropes that got me into the story, seemingly became absent concepts in Book Two. While not incidental , those surface elements are incidentally the thing that I got hung up on the first time I read this series. And they weren’t even the most important things in the saga. Frank Herbert has this reputation for making Dune some impenetrable document as rigid, complicated, and vengeful as the Old Testament. But that’s a bad rap. On the surface, the first Dune book was a seemingly simple story of betrayal and revenge. The world building, interpersonal relationships, religious philosophies, and political intrigue are as deep as anything ever put into fiction. (The vengeful part is, however, accurate.) So, when teenage Nick finished Dune ; what felt like the most epic journey my imagination had ever been on, only to crack open the next book and feel like I was thrust into the pages of a bad pulp novel, it felt a bit confusing. I read the prologue which contained on-the-nose dialogues by some nameless jailer and a historian. Okay? — The empire of Paul Maud’dib has a Spanish Inquisition team? The next chapter introduced me to Face Dancers, gaseous fish-men, and a conspiracy to kick the book into gear — It is a little pulpy. But the Harkonnens are pretty damn pulpy too. As adversaries they are supervillain-gaga. Maybe you just missed it missed it because of how epic the story was around them. Geez, young Nick, you didn’t realize it was pulp all along. With a healthy dose of psychedelia and the best world building since Tolkien. As to the confusion of the prologue, turns out that’s just a clever way to deliver exposition on what became of the Universe since Paul ascended to emperorship: It’s been twelve years since the first book, etc… Pulp might be the wrong word. But the heart of the matter is that Herbert had a vision (visions!) in which he used Dune , Book One, to dip a toe in, or maybe a foot. But with Dune Messiah , we definitely went waist deep. What’s third base in a swimming mixed metaphor? I think Frank Herbert reached his hand down my pants from a psychedelic standpoint. But I’m skipping ahead. Nick at 17 was let down. My expectations had been subverted. Dune Messiah isn’t about the Shakespearean characters performing hyper-slick action scenes. No. Book Two in the series is much more contemplative. We jump into new dramas between old characters and fresh faces. And yes, teenage Nick, there is a hell of a lot of talking. But to call that boring or hard to follow betrays an unrefined mind, kid. This novel is a procedural of emotion, passion, pleasure, the struggle with mortality — you know, the human condition — Not only did Frank Herbert up his literary game; he did so with a brevity and beauty that was perfect for this story. And what we think of as a slow burn actually has new twists and intrigues on practically every other page. If you pay attention, which the writing makes easy to do, the payoff is a powerful one indeed. On that note: Paul Maud’dib is dealing with some heavy stuff as Emperor of the known Universe. He had allowed (Or he claimed it as out of his control) a horrible Jihad to rage across the universe. This Holy War is what I struggled with the most both times I read the novel — and perhaps Herbert was using this as a way to expand the reader’s consciousness? (This is a meta theory if you tie it into the Ghola\/Hayt\/Duncan Idaho’s fate. Whoa. There’s a thesis, man���) You really have to open up new channels of thought to figure out why Paul could not stop evil from being done in the Atreides name. Was there really was no order of events or commands that could’ve stopped the Fremen conquerers? There was a series of events that could control the Jihad! It just took Paul twelve years to make it work! So now we get into the goods. Here’s what makes this book such a killer, twelve-round-fight-with-a-knockout-punch, genius piece of literature. Paul faces several huge problems that seem insurmountable. And he feels trapped by his prescience. If one could see the future and decided on a certain path, the sheer boredom would be brutal. But there is still too much fear for the boredom to kick in. There is a complicated conspiracy against him that is so powerful, even his knowledge of the plot cannot stop its machinations. Paul must produce an heir. If this is done improperly, the love of his life would be tortured and turned into a slave. the Jihad must be stopped. The unbalanced government fueled by religious zealots needs to be set on a more progressive track. That’s quite a tall order for 329 pages. On top of that, we are told in the prologue about Paul’s downfall. So now we’re faced with a whodunnit?, or more of a howdunnit? Will the conspirators win the day? Can Paul cement a legacy that reaches beyond violence? Can Chani bear a child that lives? So we sit through all the meetings, and conversations that take place jumping between multiple points-of-view. We delve into character’s deepest thoughts, passions, desires, and inadequacies — something that Herbert can actually pull off. What could have been a mess of massive internal dialogues, instead becomes a string, a chord, and finally a cable pulling the reader forward page by page. Yes, young Nick. How could you understand the anxiety a father feels for his children? Or a husband for his wife of more than a decade? You really can’t. Frank Herbert wrote a book for grown ups. And when you’re all grown up, you might catch a bit of what was trying to be conveyed. All the while being heaped with a massive dose of trippy visions pulling you into the undertow of genetic and higher-thinking philosophies. Before we realize what he’s done, Herbert has crafted the perfect ending to Paul’s journey. It is melancholy and poetic. And after chapters of Paul’s nihilistic despair and frenetic energy, he is given peace. You try writing something half as spectacular. So, teenage Nick, give it some time, buddy. Dune Messiah comes highly recommended from you, a man who has changed a little bit over the last twenty years. — **Finally here’s that weird note that pops up in a bunch of Goodreads reviews. I’ll go ahead and quote some actual reviews here (Of course, I’m not going to call out individual names. I’m not here to pick a fight. These reviewers have just as much validity in their feelings towards the book as I do.) Bolds added by me.— “I'm realizing there's not much to this book. It simply bridges the first and third.” “After re-reading Dune recently, I decided to finally get around to reading Dune Messiah - the sequel to Dune and the bridge to Children of Dune.” “I read in reviews all over the Internet that it was boring that it was basically only a bridge between DUNE and CHILDREN OF DUNE.” “For me Dune Messiah acts as a slightly dull (but not too shabby) bridge to go on to the original trilogy’s grand finale Children of Dune\" (This next one says the same thing but surprisingly doesn’t use the key word, BRIDGE . Seriously, what is going on here?) “The feel of the book is like a prelude to what comes next, that the third book will be the true sequel to Dune.” “This is not to say I didn't love the book -- far from it! It definitely feels like a bridging book between \"Dune\" and \"Children of Dune”” You get the point. At least 30 different reviews used this terminology in my quick scan. Firstly: What the hell is going on? Did everyone read each other’s reviews and just spew the same points using their own re-ordered sentences? Is there some secret Dune -whisperer-critic that said this is a “bridge” novel and that became reality for everyone else? Seriously, wtf? Secondly: I think most of these folks are wrong. You could stop the series at Dune Messiah and have a really satisfying ending to Paul’s journey. Honestly, Messiah is one of the best damn endings I’ve ever read. It’s a magic trick where the cards are face up the whole time and you’re still left wondering how Frank Herbert pulled it off. Good stuff, Mr. Herbert. Young Nick, ignore these “ bridge ” acolytes. I don’t trust ‘em. :P"

        "text":"Hace mucho tiempo que tenía ganas de leer la secuela de Dune y ahora que por fin lo he hecho me ha dejado sentimientos encontrados. Es un relato que arranca 12 años después del final de la primera parte y va a mostrarnos en qué ha ido a parar el imperio galáctico a manos de su nuevo emperador. Es un libro mucho más lento, reflexivo y filosófico que el anterior... esto por norma general suele gustarme, pero en esta ocasión hubo muchas partes que me resultaron confusas y hasta la mitad de la novela (que además es bastante breve) no conseguí interesarme verdaderamente por lo que estaba ocurriendo. Por otro lado el desenlace me encantó y me ha dejado con muchísimas ganas de leer la siguiente parte con la próxima generación. Creo que todos los que amaron la primera parte conseguirán disfrutar de esta en mayor o menor medida, tiene más intrigas políticas, más corrupción espacial, más worldbuilding fascinante y lo más importante de todo... más bene gesserit. *******Alia gracias por existir *******Jessica vuelve"

        "text":"Sometimes one book is enough. Sometimes less is more. Sometimes a story needs to be left alone. I have never been more disappointed with a sequel in my entire life. It’s that bad I wish I never read it and I also wish that the author never wrote it because it adds absolutely nothing to the franchise. I’m so surprised at how poor it is. I’ve heard that the series gets worse with each book, and I can’t imagine how it could get any worse than this. So, I’m going to stop right here and save myself writing anymore negative reviews and wasting my time with bad writing. The main problem is that nothing really happens. The plot is non-existent, which is surprising considering just how intricate the first book is. The world is huge, and Herbert could have done so much with it. Instead, he extended the story further than it should have been and the consequences are dire. The only point of interest, a resurrected character from the first book, fails to deliver the drama and tension he appears to bring with his presence. Ultimately, because the first book is just so fantastic, the sequels will only ever be compared to it. It’s how these things work. A series needs to be consistent in its imaginative power and it needs to be consistent in its drive and quality. This is so weak compared to the first book that I could only ever be disappointed. Whilst there are some interesting aspects, they suffer because the plot stays so stationery and frets over the ethics of religious jihad and Paul’s impassivity in the face of his destiny. I also found the mention of real-world historical figures a little odd considering there was no mention of anything like this in the first novel. There is a comparison between Paul and Hitler, as Herbert considers who has killed more people during the act of conquest. And this threw me totally off because the series seemed very self-contained. It’s like Richard III being mentioned in a Star Wars novel when the universe wasn’t built on ours initially. This totally destroyed any sense of immersion in the plot. Herbert should have just stuck to one book or, better yet, actually wrote a decent sequel or something new. ___________________________________ You can connect with me on social media via My Linktree . __________________________________"

        "text":"Oh, man, where the fuck do I really even start? When I've read Dune last year I fell head over heels in love with it. It had been such a long time since I've read a chunky sci-fi\/fantasy novel and I seriously didn't expect to love that book, its characters, the world building, and its plot as much as I did. Empires do not suffer emptiness of purpose at the time of their creation. It is when they have become established that aims are lost and replaced by vague ritual. And even though Dune had a somewhat closed ending, I was still curious to see where Paul Muad'Dib would end up. What would happen to Arrakis under his rule? To the Fremen? To the whole universe? I've heard many interesting takes on the series as a whole, and I am mainly interested in the philosophical questions of power, worship and human control over nature that it raises. Therefore, I knew that I had to give Dune Messiah a shot, to piece the puzzle together, and to get more answers. I didn't nearly love it as much as I loved Dune . Dune had the big advantage of everything being new. I was introduced to Arrakis, to the Atreides, the Harkonnens; I saw the ornithopters, the Fremen stillsuits and the sandworms for the first time; I started to grasp the complexity of this world that Frank Herbert created. Whereas in Dune Messiah , albeit the world has changed, it still feels oddly familiar. To me, the sequel didn't feel as fresh or new or even original. It felt more like the traditional sci-fi novels that I usually stay clear off. In Dune , Paul was a young boy who led a revolution against the tyranny of the Padishah empire. However, when he ascended the throne as emperor, a jihad got unleashed in his name, leading to the death of 61 billion people. He became a failed hero. Heroes who fail to recognise their humanity fall into an abyss of desolation forged from the failures they encounter once realism dawns on them. There exists no separation between gods and men; one blends softly casual into the other. Dune Messiah shows how deadly religion can get once it has a cause that fuels it. Paul knows that even if he were to disappear or die, he wouldn't be able to stop the jihad, he'd simply become a martyr, a God, fuelling the jihad even more. The people fighting in his name have become fanatics, succumbed to a cause that will never let them out of its grips. There are problems in this universe for which there are no answers. Nothing. Nothing can be done. In Dune Messiah , we find many interesting musings on power and freedom: \"Power tends to isolate those who hold too much of it. Eventually, they lose touch with reality … and fall.\", \"Any delusions of Free Will he harboured now must be merely the prisoner rattling his cage. His curse lay in the fact that he saw the cage.\", and \"Too much freedom breeds chaos.\" I wish I had found the time (or energy) to contemplate these a lot more, because I really like how Herbert subverts the (white) savior trope in this series. Paul is a failed hero. And for that, he is the most interesting character in these books. We see the paradoxes surrounding him. So, I really like what Herbert has to say about the nature of power, and how it corrupts (not just the person who holds it but also the cause for which it is used), however, I have to admit that I haven't (yet) dived deep into an interpretation of the series. I think I will save that for when I've finished Children of Dune . I can't wait to read all the hot takes and watch video essays on it. Now let's discuss some of the things I really didn't enjoy this book – and why it ultimately left me a little bit disappointed. Similarly to Dune , Frank Herbert's writing style is just really not my cup of tea. I don't think that his writing is beautiful nor effective. Whilst I love his world building and appreciate the complexity of the universe he created, I have to admit that I struggle with visualising any of his descriptions. Therefore, I was very happy that I could bounce off the visuals of Denis Villeneuve's new film. They really helped me picture the world whilst reading. However, as new characters and elements of the world are introduced in Dune Messiah , I struggled with visualising them. It's not that Herbert doesn't describe them, it's just how he does it that doesn't work for me. I always end up picturing the most ridiculous things possible. For example, if you compare Herbert's descriptions of the members of the Spacing Guild – \"Edric swam in a container of orange gas … The Guildsman was an elongated figure, vaguely humanoid with finned feet and hugely fanned membraneous hands – a fish in a strange sea. His tank’s vents emitted a pale orange cloud rich with the smell of the geriatric spice, melange.\" – to Denis Villeneuve's cool design for the movie: It's not hard to pick a favorite. Herbert's description seems so ... weird? A fish-like figure swimming in an orange gas tank? What is that supposed to look like? How is that practical for the story? How does Edric move forward? Isn't he super vulnerable because people could just break his tank?? What is happening? Whereas in the movie, the Spacing Guild looks fucking epic, even intimidating. They have a much more Star Wars -y design. And I can take them seriously. In the movie, they are much more believable. Another example is the Dune Tarot. Up to this day, I don't understand what its function is or how it even works. It's an oracular tool (basically Tarot cards?) sold in markets on Arrakis. For some reason, that is never properly explained, the existence of the Tarot muddles Paul's and Alia's ability to see the future. Wait, what? How? And why? Because there are more prophets. It makes no sense. Also, just picturing Fremen dealing with Tarot cards is too fucking funny to me. Again, it's a part of the world that would've probably been really cool and epic in the films, but in the book, I fail to take it seriously. My biggest gripe with Dune Messiah , however, is what Frank Herbert did to the character of Alia. She had such great potential in Dune , being the youngest and most powerful Reverend Mother, I couldn't wait to see her as a teenager (she is 15 at the beginning of Dune Messiah ), so that she could become more integral to the plot. Instead of fleshing out her character and giving her an important role (which would suit her powers), Herbert does nothing but sexualise her throughout the entirety of the novel. It was frustrating, and even disgusting at times, but let me elaborate: It all started going to shit right off the bat, when the Tleilaxu admit that their plan is to distract her by making her fall in love with Hayt: \"She is of an age when she can be distracted by a charming male designed for that purpose. She will be attracted by his maleness and by his abilities as a mentat.\" So, you're telling me, one of the most powerful creatures of this universe will get distracted and lured into a trap by a man? Umm, okay, sure. Keep on dreaming, Herbert. I really don't understand why Herbert was so obsessed with stressing the point that now, at age 15, Alia has her sexual awakening: \"It was lust in tension with chastity, she thought. Her flesh desired a mate. Sex held no casual mystery for a Reverend mother who had presided at the sketch orgies.\" I mean, what is happening??? Why is that necessary?? Paul didn't go through a sex-crazy phase when he was a teenager in Dune , so why must Alia? The lowest of low points was the scene in which Alia decides to do target practice naked: \"Abruptly, Alia climbed dripping from the bath, strode wet an naked into the training chamber which adjoined her bedroom.\" The whole scene was so muddled by the male gaze it was hard to bear. Women do not enjoy fighting naked. It's not practical, Herbert. Titties bouncing all over the place. It hurts. And the way Herbert described this naked 15-year old (!!!) girl – \"Sweat glistened on her naked skin.\" – made me very uncomfortable. It was disgusting. When Alia is discovered by her brother Paul and Stilgar, Frank Herbert once again showed that he's a man and doesn't understand teenage girls: \"Alia, growing conscious of her nudity, thought to cover herself, found the idea amusing. What the eyes had seen could not be erased.\" Absolutely not. Girls don't find it amusing when their brothers see them naked?? What is going on with you?? In general, Herbert tried to establish somewhat of a sexual tension between Alia and Paul (...who is 30 at this point, mind you – AND HER FUCKING BROTHER) – \"Paul took his time reading the reactions on her face and body: the flush of her exertions colouring her skin, the wet fulness of her lips. There was a disquieting femaleness about her that he had never considered in his sister.\" – and I wasn't here for any of that. It was soooo unnecessary to the plot, and just disgusting. When Paul noticed that \"Yes – there’d been a ruttish air about Alia.\" I actually wanted to throw my copy of the book away. I mean, what the fuck is going on here, Frank? Can we focus, please? Another way that Alia was thrown under the bus in this novel is her relationship to Hayt\/Duncan. Alia, the most powerful and most KNOWLEDGEABLE creature in the universe (having absorbed all the knowledge of all Reverend Mothers before her), becomes a naive and silly girl in front of Hayt and his \"male confidence\" (her words, not mine...). At the end of the book, she literally says to him: \"'I need you, Duncan,' she sobbed. 'Love me.'\" Are you fucking kidding me? How about you start using your powers and choosing your own destiny, instead of relying on this man (who kissed you without your consent btw)??? So yeah, Alia's character went DOWN THE DRAIN, and I'm still pissed about it. Anyways, what follows now is a very short summary of Dune Messiah – which I will use for further reference once I get to Children of Dune (ya'll know that my memory is like a sieve) – so please beware of spoilers: Twelve years after Paul Atreides's ascension as emperor, the death toll of the jihad unleashed in his name peeks 61 billion people. Paul gains total control of Melange's production, making him the most powerful emperor to have ever ruled. Using his prescience, Paul tries to create a golden path for humanity. “I’ve killed sixty-one billion, sterilised ninety planets, completely demoralised five hundred others. I’ve wiped out the followers of forty religions which had existed since.” The Bene Gesserit, Spacing Guild, and Tleilaxu come together to plot a plan that will lead to Paul's dethroning. Reverend Mother Gaius recruits Princess Irulan, Paul's consort, to work on the inside, and she does so by adding contraceptives into Chani's food, preventing her from conceiving for Paul. However, Chani gets pregnant after using a Fremen fertility diet. Scytale, the face dancer from the Tleilaxu, brings Paul a gift of Duncan Idaho's ghola, called Hayt. Paul's acceptance of Hayt creates a rift between him and the Fremen. Paul discovers a Fremen plot to kill him and confronts his opposition. Paul gets blinded by a Stone Burner. Paul tries negotiating Chani's life in exchange for artificially inseminating Princess Irulan. As foreseen, Chani dies in childbirth, and Hayt attacks Paul but recovers his former self. Paul kills Scytale by using his son's eyes after having received a prescient vision from the perspective of his newborn son. Paul then loses his own prescience in the act. Paul leaves his new twin babies in Alia's care and walks into the desert as a man as per the Fremen tradition. Alia orders the execution of Paul's enemies, including Reverend Mother Gaius and Edric. However, she spares Princess Irulan."

        "text":"If you ask any first-time reader of ‘Dune’ where he or she thinks the story is likely to go in the follow-up, I doubt if anyone could have predicted ‘Dune Messiah’. It does not work as a book, as there is really no beginning, just a slow (very, very slow and exposition-laden) flat-line of a narrative that gives a slight blip at the overly dramatic ending, which is clearly meant to set-up ‘Children of Dune’ rather than end the second book in any satisfactory fashion. I think ‘Dune Messiah’ is much better-suited as the last part of ‘Dune’ itself, where it would function as a reflective coda deconstructing the consequences of the preceding events. Clearly, ‘Dune Messiah’ did little to deter the juggernaut that the Dune books would ultimately become. It had about as much effect as poor old Paul trying to avert the jihad and prevent humanity going off the rails of civilisation. Paul spends pretty much the entire book in an existential funk, pondering his increasingly opaque and contradictory visions (much to the frustration of the patient reader, who still has no clue as to what it is he is actually ‘seeing’.) In a throwaway line so typical of much of the off-hand nature of ‘Dune Messiah’, as if Herbert was deliberately trying to avoid emulating anything that characterised the previous book (and that had made readers fall in love with it), Paul compares notes with fellow ‘emperors’ Genghis Khan and Hitler: “Statistics: at a conservative estimate, I’ve killed sixty-one billion, sterilized ninety planets, completely demoralized five hundred others. I’ve wiped out the followers of forty religions…” This is well into the book’s last act, and does make the reader raise an eyebrow. Oh, so that’s why Paul is in such a bad mood! Apparently, it is barely 12 years after the ending of ‘Dune’, a rather odd number that I’ve seen bandied about but don’t recall being referenced in the actual text. A vast bureaucracy known as the Qizarate has arisen to administer (and temper) the religious fanaticism that has arisen around Paul. A pilgrimage route known as the ‘hajj’ is well-established by now, with Arrakis as its ultimate destination, ensuring that the Qizarate’s coffers are always overflowing. Jessica, however, wants nothing to do with this: Despite the special reverence held for Caladan as the place of Paul’s birth, the Lady Jessica had emphasized her refusal to make her planet a stop on the hajj. “No doubt my son is an epochal figure of history,” she’d written, “but I cannot see this as an excuse for submitting to a rabble invasion.” The main plot of ‘Dune Messiah’ concerns the machinations of a ‘fellowship’ of disparate stakeholders drawn into an uneasy alliance with the common purpose of unseating Paul from his throne. Herbert is always very precise about his terminology, and I am sure his reference to a ‘company of conspirators’ is a deliberate inversion of how the term ‘fellowship’ is used in ‘Lord of the Rings’, for example, the other contemporary countercultural novel that ‘Dune’ is often compared with. While we have the usual suspects like Mohiam and Irulan, it is the new characters and players introduced into the mix that really elevates ‘Dune Messiah’ into something special. If you thought ‘Dune’ could not get any weirder than the quasi-mystical mumbo jumbo of the original, then ‘Dune Messiah’ quickly makes you realise that Herbert still has quite a number of cards up his sleeve (there is a lovely riff on the Dune Tarot set throughout the book.) Bijaz, described as a dwarf Tleilaxu oracle, is a weird combination of Falstaff from Shakespeare and Chucky from the Child’s Play movies, and would not be out of place in a David Lynch movie. Speaking of Lynch, he obviously nicked Edric the mutated Guild Navigator straight from the pages of ‘Dune Messiah’, turning it into an indelible image in SF cinema. Herbert seems to be a fan of baroque excess, as evinced by the flamboyant and thoroughly despicable Baron in ‘Dune’. In ‘Dune Messiah’, however, he introduces yet another shadowy player that is potentially even more perverse and grotesque, the Bene Tleilax. Just where the hell did they come from? Despite the ancient proscription on using computers that arose from the Butlerian Jihad, the Tleilaxu is clearly the predecessor of LexCorp, always flirting with dangerous technology: The Tleilaxu displayed a disturbing lack of inhibitions in what they created. Unbridled curiosity might guide their actions. They boasted they could make anything from the proper human raw material—devils or saints. They sold killer-mentats. They’d produced a killer medic, overcoming the Suk inhibitions against the taking of human life to do it. Their wares included willing menials, pliant sex toys for any whim, soldiers, generals, philosophers, even an occasional moralist. The best demonstration of the overriding creepiness of the Bene Tleilax, of course, is their presentation of a special gift to Paul, a ghola of Duncan Idaho himself, plucked from the battlefield and reanimated like Frankstein’s monster in an axolotl tank (clearly an inversion of the Fremen death still). Alia of the Knife, whom Herbert often reminds the reader is on the cusp of her womanhood, as if there is a noxious whiff of the Baron still hanging around, is immediately turned on by Hayt, the ghola’s Tleilaxu name. Not subtle at all, Herbert. Alia attempts to work off some steam by sparring with an updated version of the fighting machine that Paul used on Caladan in ‘Dune’ (this one even has flashing lights.) Except she does so in the nude. Yes, sex rears its head in ‘Dune Messiah’ like Shai Hulud popping up out of the sand. (A lot of SFX ingenuity in Lynch’s 1984 ‘Dune’ went into preventing the sandworms looking like questing penises. Lynch was only partially successful, but that could have been deliberate on his part.) Herbert reminds us that orgies were a commonplace occurrence in the Fremen sietch (if you recall, Paul first had sex with Chani in the spice-induced orgy after he kills Jamis in single-handed combat.) We even get a quotation from Chapter 3 of The Steersman’s Guild, entitled ‘THE ORGY AS A TOOL OF STATECRAFT’. And as if the Bene Gesserit weren’t in the reader’s bad books already, here they hatch a desperate plot to attempt to get Paul to fuck his sister. “…[T]hat stubborn fool of an Atreides! How could he deny the jewels of posterity within his loins?” Poor sexually-deprived Irulan wonders idly about Edric the Guild Navigator as a potential fuck buddy, “thinking how odd it would be to mate with such a one.” This, mind you, during the first meeting of the conspirators that opens the book, where her mind should be focusing on the larger issues and not be in the gutter (or Edric’s tank, as it were.) Mohiam fondly calls Lady Jessica a “traitorous bitch”, who in turn is told by Scytale: “You are not a sex object, have never been a sex object, cannot be a sex object.” Ouch. That had to hurt as much as the gom jabbar. Ah, Scytale. Described as a ‘Jadacha hermaphrodite’, he (pronouns weren’t as advanced in 1969 when ‘Dune Messiah’ was published), can assume either sex at will, and is commonly referred to as a Face Dancer. “For the present, I am a man,” he declares. The reader is not convinced, because there is something even oilier about Scytale than that uber-creep the Baron. It is especially uncomfortable because Herbert seems to signpost a latent effeminacy or sexual ambiguity in Scytale as being fundamentally wrong. It is clear that a lot of the convoluted sexual politics of ‘Dune’, wrapped up as it were in Herbert’s own subconscious biases towards misogyny and homophobia, begin to, er, come into play in ‘Dune Messiah’. ‘Dune Messiah’ is the literary equivalent of a ‘spice blow’, which is the result of immense pressure building up within a pre-spice mass deep within the sands of Arrakis. (Of course, this is what killed Liet Kynes when he rather stupidly went to lay on top of one in ‘Dune’.) At only about a third of the length of the original novel, so much is packed into ‘Dune Messiah’ that a spice blow is inevitable. Herbert’s writing is always at its most delicate and evocative when he turns to Arrakis itself, and ‘Dune Messiah’ is no exception. He clearly has a deep and abiding love for the desert world he has created, which is a tabula rasa of the natural world despoiled by humanity and its increasingly dramatic and uncontrollable impact on our own planet. There is a wonderful scene near the end when Chani returns to her sietch to give birth (and precipitate the crisis that launches the next book in the sequence): Windblown sand whipped at her, reddened her cheeks. She glanced over her shoulder at the frightful band of dust across the sky. The desert beneath the storm had taken on a tawny, restless appearance as though dune waves beat on a tempest shore the way Paul had once described a sea. She hesitated, caught by a feeling of the desert’s transience. Measured against eternity, this was no more than a caldron. Dune surf thundered against cliffs. The storm out there had become a universal thing for her—all the animals hiding from it...nothing left of the desert but its own private sounds: blown sand scraping along rock, a wind-surge whistling, the gallop of a boulder tumbled suddenly from its hill—then! somewhere out of sight, a capsized worm thumping its idiot way aright and slithering off to its dry depths. As far as I recall, this is the only worm sighting in the entire book, apart from a side plot involving a bunch of Fremen traitors capturing a small maker to take it off-planet and start the spice cycle on a similar world. Ah, but they don’t know about the sand plankton that is such an integral part of the sandworm lifecycle, which is probably what George Lucas had in mind when he started tinkering with the role of midichlorians as an essential component of the Star Wars universe. Herbert continues: Sietch odors assaulted her nostrils. The place was a ferment of nasal memories—the warren closeness of bodies, rank esters of the reclamation stills, familiar food aromas, the flinty burning of machines at work...and through it all, the omnipresent spice: melange everywhere. She took a deep breath. “Home.” Extraordinary. And it is exactly as if the reader him- or herself has returned home, to the deep desert of Arrakis where it all began. Chani’s viewpoint is reflected in Paul’s own perspective: Ugly, barren land! He imagined it sun-soaked and monstrous with heat, a place of sandslides and the drowned darkness of dust pools, blowdevils unreeling tiny dunes across the rocks, their narrow bellies full of ochre crystals. But it was a rich land, too: big, exploding out of narrow places with vistas of storm-trodden emptiness, rampart cliffs and tumbledown ridges. All it required was water...and love. Life changed those irascible wastes into shapes of grace and movement, he thought. That was the message of the desert. Contrast stunned him with realization. He wanted to turn to the aides massed in the sietch entrance, shout at them: If you need something to worship, then worship life—all life, every last crawling bit of it! We’re all in this beauty together! Yes, I know that this is Herbert at his most ‘hippy dippy’ – and it is certainly no surprise that a novel as batshit crazy as this would have such a deeply Age of Aquarius moment in it. But, for me, this is still one of the most remarkable, and memorable, passages in the entire saga. It is the ‘Circle of Life’, writ boldly on the ever-shifting sands of Dune."

        "text":"Segunda entrega de la extraordinaria saga de Frank Herbert, Las crónicas de Dune, considerada una de las más importantes sagas de CF de todos los tiempos. Una joya memorable y atemporal que será siempre el desierto de Arrakis. El mesías de Dune continúa la historia de Paul Atreides, mejor conocido – y temido -, bajo el nombre de Muad’Dib. Como emperador del universo conocido, posee más poder del que jamás debió ejercerun solo hombre. Venerado como ídolo religioso por los vehementes Fremen, Paul se enfrenta a la hostilidad de las castas políticas que desplazó cuando asumió el trono, así como una conspiración dentro de su propio círculo de seguidores. Aunque la Casa Atreides ya comienza a desmoronarse a su alrededor por las intrigas de sus enemigos, la verdadera amenaza para Paul vendrá de su concubina, Chani, y de su hijo nonato, heredero de la dinastía familiar. El mesías de Dune tiene un tono y un estilo completamente diferente al de Dune. Dune estaba lleno de aventura e incluso una arenosa esperanza, todo un grupo trabajando, dispuesto a morir para transformar y cambiar el entorno. Además, Dune tenía un montón de personajes muy fuertes. Por el contrario, el mesías es más político y emocional. El tono en este ha sido más oscuro que el de Dune y no tan inspirador y filosófico. El final del mesías fue un poquito decepcionante, todo lo contrario del final de Dune. O yo tengo el primero en un pedestal y todas las comparaciones son odiosas. Miedo me da el tercero que he leído que para muchos fue algo innecesario. No es tan épico, es casi como un western con muchas intrigas políticas y con referencias a ciertos acontecimientos, pero muy poca acción por no decir inexistente. La sensación del libro es como un preludio de lo que viene después, el tercer libro para mi será la verdadera secuela de Dune. Para los fans de Dune, sin duda, y realmente necesitáis haber leído Dune para conocer a los personajes y tener una idea sobre la compleja e intrincadamente detallada construcción del mundo de Herbert. No deja de ser una genial lectura de lo más entretenida ya que volver a Dune es siempre una idea cojonuda..✍️🎩"

        "text":"Returning to the original world of Dune has a special place in my heart. I seem to recall that Messiah was written before Dune but obviously Dune was published before it. Of course, a beginning is the time for taking the most delicate care that the balances are correct. This every fan of Frank Herbert knows. To begin your study of the life of Dune, then, take care that you first place this in its proper time. Know then that it is the year 2021 and all the covidiots and Q factions have taken over the universe. What was once an act of glorious revenge against a teetering empire has now become an entrenched tragedy. Reading Dune Messiah is the tragedy that we deserve. Taken over by religious zealots, icons over careful deliberation, countless dead instead of a stable empire. But that's where the comparison fails. Paul, unlike any of us, has a much clearer idea of the future, being able to see it, however imperfectly, and he is caught in a web of intrigue and guile and that beautiful sliver of hope hidden in the future that only his eyes see, where only perfidy, assassination, and betrayal seems to be his new bed. Twelve years after the end of Dune, Alia is a teenager and a bright star. Irulan wants an heir to the Empire, Chani is a devoted but flattened character, as is Paul, as all futures grind down to singular points. The time of crisis comes and tragedy, depression, and horror awaits. But at least there is a copy of Duncan Idaho. Now a mentat, a tool of assassination -- and a human computer -- his role captures Paul as hardly anything else could have. Honestly, for years, I thought this one was the worst of the Dune books. But mostly that's because I cared too strongly for Paul, never wanted to see him fall. In actuality, the book is delightfully intellectual and complex, showing us so much more about the Fremen and the pitfalls of a religion-based monarchy and the hellish pitfalls of prescience. Being a god is not all it's cracked up to be. And in a moment or two, Paul's son is going to ask his papa to hold his beer."

        "text":"Secondo romanzo del ciclo di Dune. Sono trascorsi dodici anni da quando i Fremen hanno dato seguito alla loro profezia ed hanno massacrato mondi interi. Il nome di Muad'dib è tuttora, nella galassia, sinonimo di morte. Il tema centrale del romanzo è il pericolo di idolatrare un leader carismatico. Paul non è più il giovane duca in ascesa, ma un imperatore tormentato. La sua jihad, scatenata nel primo libro, ha provocato la morte di miliardi di persone, e lui è prigioniero del suo stesso potere e della sua profezia. Si esplora la linea estremamente sottile tra un salvatore e un tiranno, tema ripreso abbondantemente nel quarto romanzo. Paul è diventato un simbolo incontrollabile, e la sua stessa esistenza è la causa di una violenza che non può fermare. A differenza del primo Dune, che era pieno di battaglie e avventura su larga scala, Messia di Dune ha un ritmo più lento e introspettivo e si concentra sull'intrigo politico e sulla psicologia dei personaggi. Il romanzo mostra le lotte interiori di Paul, la sua prescienza che è sia una benedizione che una maledizione, e il suo disperato tentativo di sfuggire a un destino che ha previsto ma non riesce a evitare. Herbert critica la fede cieca e l'esaltazione religiosa, un avvertimento contro la creazione di figure divine e l'abbandono del libero arbitrio a favore di una religione o di un leader. La prescienza di Paul lo mette di fronte a un paradosso: vedere il futuro significa anche esserne schiavo. La ricerca e la lotta per trovare un \"Sentiero Dorato\" che salvi l'umanità dall'estinzione, anche a un costo personale altissimo. Vengono introdotti personaggi chiave come il ghola di Duncan Idaho, Hayt, che aggiunge un ulteriore livello di introspezione sulla natura dell'identità e della manipolazione. La principessa Irulan, che nel primo libro era una figura quasi marginale, qui assume un ruolo più attivo. Il rapporto tra Paul e Chani, messi alla prova dagli intrighi di palazzo e dalla prescienza di Paul, diventa il cuore emotivo del romanzo. Messia di Dune è un romanzo più filosofico e meno spettacolare del suo predecessore, ma è un tassello essenziale per comprendere la visione completa di Herbert. Mostra le conseguenze del trionfo e distrugge l'idea del salvatore per mostrare la fragilità e il peso del potere assoluto. Qualcuno ha il coraggio di definirla letteratura di evasione...ahhahahah ----------------------------- The second novel in the Dune series. Twelve years have passed since the Fremen fulfilled their prophecy and massacred entire worlds. The name Muad'dib is still synonymous with death throughout the galaxy. The central theme of the novel is the danger of idolizing a charismatic leader. Paul is no longer the rising young duke, but a tormented emperor. His jihad, unleashed in the first book, has resulted in the deaths of billions, and he is a prisoner of his own power and his prophecy. The novel explores the extremely fine line between savior and tyrant, a theme revisited extensively in the fourth novel. Paul has become an uncontrollable symbol, and his very existence is the cause of a violence he cannot stop. Unlike the first Dune, which was filled with battles and large-scale adventure, Dune Messiah has a slower, more introspective pace and focuses on political intrigue and the characters' psychology. The novel reveals Paul's internal struggles, his prescience, which is both a blessing and a curse, and his desperate attempt to escape a fate he foresaw but cannot avoid. Herbert criticizes blind faith and religious exaltation, a warning against the creation of divine figures and the abandonment of free will in favor of a religion or leader. Paul's prescience presents him with a paradox: to see the future also means being its slave. The search and struggle to find a \"Golden Path\" that can save humanity from extinction, even at great personal cost. Key characters are introduced, such as the Duncan Idaho ghola, Hayt, who adds a further layer of insight into the nature of identity and manipulation. Princess Irulan, who was almost a peripheral figure in the first book, takes on a more active role here. The relationship between Paul and Chani, tested by palace intrigue and Paul's prescience, becomes the emotional heart of the novel. Dune Messiah is a more philosophical and less spectacular novel than its predecessor, but it is an essential piece to understanding Herbert's complete vision. It shows the consequences of triumph and destroys the idea of ​​a savior to demonstrate the fragility and weight of absolute power. Someone has the courage to define it as escapist literature...hahahaha"

        "text":"Dune Messiah By Frank Herbert A Dune Retrospective by Eric Allen Four years after the publication of Dune, those who cried out for a sequel were finally answered. Frank Herbert returned to Arrakis for a book that was very different from the action packed first volume of the series, but at the same time, still held a lot of the familiar. When I tell people that I actually enjoyed the sequel to Dune more than the original, the answer I get from the overwhelming majority is, \"Wait . . . Dune has a sequel?\" People know of Dune nowadays through the 1984 cult classic movie. Some people may be vaguely aware that the movie was based on a book, but never bothered to pick it up or look for sequels. Which is a shame, because they're missing out on this little gem of a book. Twelve years after taking the throne of the empire for himself in Dune, Paul \"Muad'Dib\" Atreides has become something of a God, or Savior figure to the Fremen, who have taken up arms and spread out throughout the entire known universe bringing a Holy War to subjugate all beneath his rule. All of this, very much against Paul's own wishes. He has become a figurehead, standing atop the empire as Emperor, while priests of the religion that worships him rule in his name. He has made good his promise to begin turning Dune into a paradise, and now the desert runs freely with water. Another sign to his followers of his godhood. Princess Irulan, Paul's trophy wife, and the means by which he secured the throne is anxious to follow her Bene Gesserit orders to bear the royal heir, but Paul has no love for her and refuses it to her, instead remaining true to his real, Fremen wife Chani. This leads Irulan to join a conspiracy against the Emperor, meant to discredit him, destroy his reputation, and take the wind out of the Fremen Zealots' sails. Out of spite, she has been feeding Chani contraceptives to prevent her from ever bearing Paul an heir, but this plan failed, and Chani conceived anyway. It is discovered that Fremen are part of the conspiracy against Paul, and while meeting with a man to get the names, Paul is blinded in an attempt on his life. Through the powers of his oracular sight, he can still see, though his body is blind. Long story short, after Chani dies in childbirth, Paul wanders into the desert alone, blind and broken, never to be seen again, and leaving the Empire in the hands of his sister Alia until his children are old enough to assume rule. The Good? Again, Frank Herbert did a ridiculous amount of research before writing this book. It shows in how he truly understands the mechanics of economics, politics, and religion. The religion that he has built up around Paul is intriguing, and realistic, and the atrocities that its zealots commit in his name feel logical, and realistic as well. Paul's suffering under the burden of the sins of those who follow him is really well done. This book is more a character study on him, than really anything else, showing the impact his actions have had on him as a person. This is a very different kind of book than the first in the series. Where the first book was all about war, this one is all about the consequences of it on the man that started it all. Despite its short length, this book has a very big and important message, and it delivers it exquisitely. Many people tend to complain that this book is rather boring after the first one, but I found Paul's inner struggles to be just as, or perhaps even more entertaining than the battles of conquest and Paul's coming of age, etc from the first book. This book is remarkably better written and put together than the first book. Not only did Frank Herbert apparently do quite a bit of research in the four years between books, but he also improved on his skills as a writer quite a bit. The storyline is tighter, less convoluted and far less confusing than that of the first book. It almost reads like something written by a completely different writer because of the increased quality of the writing, and the change of focus, but at the same time, it still has his unique style and flair to it. The Bad? I have never liked the Third Person Omniscient perspective that Frank Herbert uses. This is where the story is told by a narrator in third person that will change viewpoints between characters at the drop of a hat, without warning when any given character has any important thoughts or observations on what's going on. I find it to be rather confusing and distracting at times, and I've always thought of the style as rather amateurish. This is wholly a point of opinion, and true, many very good books are written in this particular perspective, but I don't like it, and will always count it as a bad mark against any book it appears in. Frank Herbert doesn't really seem to \"get\" female characters. He doesn't really seem to understand what motivates women, how they think, how they act, how they talk, and why they do the things that they do. Going by his female characters, one could almost say that he never met a real woman in his life. As such, they are basically just men with breasts. They have all the right girly bits, because someone in the universe has to, but the their minds and personalities are about the furthest thing from feminine as is possible. Back in the '60s this was a VERY common thing, which is getting somewhat better these days, but still lingers on. Frank Herbert's portrayal of women fits those of the times, but to anyone that might be, or has ever actually met, a real woman before, it's going to feel a bit off. Back in the day this sort of thing was acceptable, but I find it to be annoying and distracting, if not downright offensive, in this day and age. In conclusion, Dune Messiah is a VERY different type of book than its predecessor Dune, and it does have its vices, but the good more than outweighs the bad by far. The focus on Paul's dilemma with the Jihad that he inadvertently started is spectacular. Watching his inner turmoil over the countless billions that have died in his name play out is excellent. And if the female characters are off, everything else is dead on. He's created a fantastic world, with fantastic people (if you think of them all as men, anyway) to live in it, and did a great deal of research to make everything from the economics to the religion feel realistic. As an entry in the Dune Saga, it's probably one of the best. Check out my other reviews."

        "text":"I'm very much looking forward to Villeneuve's interpretation of Dune that will be shown in theaters this year so I decided to not only read the original book but also the rest of the series. After seizing power and becoming emperor by marrying Princess Irulan, Paul (well, his forces, but in his name nonetheless) has sterilized hundreds of planets, killed billions of people ... and hates his own Jihad (I loved Scytale's description of it being a mental epidemic). Paul doubts the justice and righteousness of the path he has chosen, his powers of vision encounter more and more limits, and the number of people opposing the new emperor grow ever more. Even some Fremen despise Muad'ib now. While Paul and his now 15-year-old sister, Alia, rule with a council, Irulan joins a conspiracy to kill Paul. Simultaneously, Chani wishes for nothing more than to be pregnant again (not knowing that Irulan has slipped contraceptives into her diet, thus preventing a pregnancy so far ) but Irulan herself demands the privilege of bearing her empirial husband's child (and is refused, unless she accepts artificial insemination). As if all that wasn't enough, the Navigator Guild establishes an embassy on Arrakis and brings a gift (funny, considering the German word Gift): a genetic copy of Paul's former friend and teacher, Duncan Idaho. He has a part to play, of course, knows and reveals as much as he knows about it even, but things are ... complicated. Once again, everything is shrouded in lies and mysteries and tarots, partially revealed by and often misunderstood thanks to visions. So yes, there is a lot of intrigue and personal drama here. Where the first book was about fear and self-awakening, this second one more carried the tones of self-hatred and being trapped. What I especially liked about this book is that it addressed the conflict attentive readers saw coming in the previous book: how Paul had seized power and what he presented himself as to his followers could only lead to disaster. Not to mention the downside of his powers, the price he has to pay for them. Yet there were good reasons for him to do what and how he did (preventing annihilation for humanity). Nevertheless, seizing the throne is way easier than keeping it. And religious fanatism always carries within itself the seed of its own destruction. Naturally, the sandworms still are vital to the machinations and events. Here, plans are set in motion to create another melange \"factory\" on another planet. Then there were the further revelations of the complicated genetic tapestry the Bene Gesserit have weaved, the consequences, the history (for example, they aren't the only ones with such planning and Paul apparently isn't the first Kwisatz Haderach )! Personally, I liked and dreaded Alia and \"Duncan\" getting along so well since I know where it leads to (if the mini series Children of Dune follow the book(s) faithfully) - good and bad, necessary and preventable. Likewise, I knew what would happen to Chani , also thanks to the mini series Children of Dune , but hated it and was hoping it would be different here - which was, of course, impossible. In a way, Paul wasn't wrong when he said this way was better for their children - both parents out of the picture. Yet it is hard to believe. So I was definitely emotionally invested and appropriately devastated. This book, then, offers an important insight into Paul's conflict with himself and his different personas\/potentials. It also shows the same kind of insight into Alia's mind (very important considering her having awakened to Reverend Mother awareness before she was even born and, no doubt, her future role). Last but not least, it sets the tone and places important corner stones for future developments. Because if you thought this series was about Paul, you better think again! A short-ish book, very cerebral with little actual action but still thrilling thanks to the reader excitedly following the path and the story being rounded off by the periodical interludes in the fashion of historical assessments and commentary, all of which is vital to the overall mythology and establishment of important characters that will carry the rest of the saga forward. It doesn't hurt that the author is so good at making you care about certain people in a short amount of time. P.S.: Don't let the rating fool you, this is not quite as good as the first novel. It is neither as vast in scope nor as intricate. However, it is intricate in its own way, very smart, and the rating system here is limited. This scifi book is definitely in a league of its own, too."

Forces are stirring against Paul and his reign, mimicking Newton’s “every action has an equal and opposite reaction” and Hegel’s pendulum take on history, but the biggest danger to the emperor comes from time and the burden the visions themselves bring with them. Bastions of power are destroyed and own power is reinforced in the end, albeit at the cost of a highest of sacrifices. I would call this book brilliant in concept, but my heart was never really touched. There are golems, resurrected flesh, vast bureaucracies and massive conspiracies. But the characters, maybe due to their elevated perception of time, feel ephemeral and going through the motions, instead of being in the moment acutely in danger. Alia, sister to Paul, being sexualised and incest being part of some plans, strikes me as very Egyptian pharaoh like. Also the whole insta love surrounding her and some other main character felt sloppy. And then we have Chani being nearly invisible, maybe speaking five sentences in the whole book... Still I am sure I will read into Children of Dune at some point, yet this sequel in my view could not stand up against Dune . Quotes in both Dutch and English: Reason is the first victim of strong emotion They are not mad. They're trained to believe, not to know. Belief can be manipulated. Only knowledge is dangerous Maar het was nou eenmaal het onvermijdelijke lot van macht om belegerd te worden Deze is praatziek maar wel diepzinnig Een keizer is meer dan een mens, zijn persoonlijkheid leidt het rijk Dit was geen lichtzinnig gedane gift, hij gaf eerlijke antwoorden op gevaarlijke vragen Truth suffers from too much analysis Zij bewoog het zwaard niet, het zwaard bewoog haar We kunnen niets voor eeuwig voorkomen Alle macht is beperkt Uw vernietigen sire? Kan iemand een god doden? Hoe kan hij zichzelf tegen zichzelf beschermen? Daar geloof je niets van dus waarom zou je het zeggen? De mensen willen geen boekhouder als keizer maar een meester, iemand die hen beschermd tegen veranderingen Jouw waarachtigheid is gevaarlijk Je bent dronken van teveel tijd Jij bent bang voor je eigen macht Je troost me met doorns Here lies a toppled god. His fall was not a small one. We did but build his pedestal, A narrow and a tall one. You do not beg the sun for mercy. Mijn regering is de economie Was het een nederlaag als je van twee kwaden de minste kiest? Te veel vrijheid kweekt wanorde Hij hield hen allen in de palm van zijn visioen De macht die zelfs de allemachtigsten kunnen uitoefenen zonder zichzelf te vernietigen is begrensd Ik zal doen wat de liefde van me verlangd Ik sterf aan mijn eigen voorzienigheid Maar er zijn problemen in dit heelal waarvoor geen oplossing bestaat There are problems in this universe for which there are no answers. Nothing. Nothing can be done."

        "text":"Completely Different Tone Than Dune #1 Dune #1 leaves us in a complete cliffhanger. However, Dune #2 starts up 12 years later. In the introduction to the version that I read, Brian Herbert (the author’s son) wrote that one magazine labeled this book as the “disappointment of the year.” However, he explained the book is supposed to show how absolute power can corrupt leaders including Paul Atreides. Dune Messiah has a completely different tone than Dune. Dune was filled with adventure and hope, the entire group working, willing to die, to transform the environment. Further, Dune had a bunch of very strong female characters. In contrast, Dune Messiah is more political and emotional. Also, the depiction of women is just horrible. Alia is boy crazy, and Irulan and Chani are only focused on Paul and producing an heir. In 12 years, Paul has matured. He is not the boy of Dune. He makes decisions almost cavalierly. The book was definitely entertaining though. The audiobook had an entire cast of characters, and it was such a rich experience. As with Dune, I could pick something up new each time reading Dune Messiah. However, the tone on this was much darker than Dune, and it wasn’t inspiring. The ending of Dune Messiah was so weak, the complete opposite of the ending of Dune. Recently, I was reading a list ranking all of the Dune books, and this one was rated the very worst of the series so I am still excited to continue with this series and hope that the future is a little less bleak. 2025 Reading Schedule Jan\tA Town Like Alice Feb\tBirdsong Mar\tCaptain Corelli's Mandolin - Louis De Berniere Apr\tWar and Peace May\tThe Woman in White Jun\tAtonement Jul\tThe Shadow of the Wind Aug\tJude the Obscure Sep\tUlysses Oct\tVanity Fair Nov\tA Fine Balance Dec\tGerminal Connect With Me!

        "text":"Only half the length of the original Dune , the second book in the series takes place 12 years after. Not as epic, this is almost like a chamber western, with political intrigue and references to great goings on, but little action described. The feel of the book is like a prelude to what comes next, that the third book will be the true sequel to Dune. For fans of Dune, no doubt, and you really need to have read Dune first, to know the characters and to at least have a clue about Herbert's complex and intricately detailed world building. But then, comparing this book to Dune is like comparing a country lawyer to a Supreme Court justice, the comparison itself is unfair, very few books will equal Dune or even come close. Dune Messiah is part of Herbert's great vision and is a good book in its own right. *** 2019 Reread Coming back to this book years later and after having read all of the first six that Frank Herbert, I have a better appreciation for Herbert's great vision. Describing a conspiracy against Paul after his conquest of the Universe, and devastation of myriad worlds and billions of lives lost, the author creates a setting of disquiet, as Leto's time in the Dune universe begins. Herbert's literary grasp of theology, ideology and spiritualism is on full display and this is an important book in his canon."

        "text":"‘ I live in an apocalyptic dream. ’ When the wheels of fate are churning, can you escape without being crushed beneath its wheels. Frank Herberts set up an amazing and complex political universe and sets it to explode, sending us off on a trajectory picked up by Dune Messiah . Set 12 years after the events of Dune , we find Paul Maud’dib on the Emperors throne and the Jihad has ‘ killed sixty-one billion, sterilised ninety planets, completely demoralised five hundred others ’ all in Paul’s name. Messiah has vastly expanded mechanics yet resides in a much smaller scale than its predecessor, being almost a parlor drama of ‘ plots within plots within plots ’ as before but with a more focused proximity to really feel the tension creaking through the narrative. Expanding on themes of the ways religion and politics are manipulated for power and diving deep into ideas of fate and freedom with a touch of Friedrich Nietzsche along the way, Dune Messiah is a tense and psychological thriller that really drives home the ideas left open at the end of the previous novel and charts a course for incredible new directions for the larger narrative. While the original Dune plays out on epic proportions, Messiah feels more like a Greek tragedy. Withing a few chapters of the opening we see the plot drop into the chamber and be fired off with a pretty clear indication what it leads, yet every step of the way still feels fresh and thrilling. This is in keeping with the story as well, seeing as Paul foresees much of what is coming but after a decade of winning and no surprises, a psychological challenge that could be unexpected is what he craves. ‘ He felt chained to a future which, exposed too often, had locked onto him like a greedy succubus, ’ Herbert writes, and Paul, feeling isolated from even those he loves due to his prescience while increasingly speaking with Alia on their shared struggle, begins to wish for a way to escape his all-knowing fate. This becomes increasingly tragic when he can see great loss before they happen and the only advice his sister can give is ‘ we must not grieve for those dear to us before their passing ’ The story feels a bit more loose and less tidy in this one, an obvious difficulty when constructing a narrative around prescience. Yet the political tensions and plottings keep it sharp and direct, and where Herbert really excels is getting into character’s heads during discussions and seeing the internal mastermining going on. This is especially exciting with Scytale, a Tleilaxu Face Dancer that can shift into any body because if Bene Gesserits weren’t enough, this shapeshifting class only hinted at before is now on full conniving display to remind you that the Dune universe is terrifying and awesome. It is a tight cast, with less than a dozen primary characters including the return of Duncan Idaho as a clone, or ‘ghola’, also going by the name Heyt. Which, as expected, becomes an issue with the Fremen who see technology such as this as potentially blasphemous. Scytale warns ‘ reason is the first victim of strong emotion ’ and much of Messiah is mental chess full of strong emotions to throw Paul off his game. It’s pretty dark, considering he knows Duncan has been sent to probably kill him and it’s his friend yet not his friend at all as boisterous Duncan is now a stoic and pensive intellectual. ‘ Truth suffers from too much analysis. ’ -Ancient Fremen Saying Messiah seems hellbent on reminding you that the events of Dune were not a heroic and great thing but a pretty twisted political contest of colonialism, manipulation and mass murder. Like murder on the galactic scale of genocide. The Jihad is not awesome and people are starting to talk about that. The opening pages are an intense interview with a historian about to be executed for writing a critical historical analysis of Paul and his rise to power, and he tells the Fremen ‘ you learned early to call the truth heresy. ’ The ruling powers dismiss anything not in keeping with their narrative, one held firmly together by the glue of religion. ‘ Religion, too, is a weapon, ’ Herbert writes, and asks us ‘ what manner of weapon is religion when it becomes the government? ’ We begin to see the religious gaslighting to keep a strong and obedient population ready to kill. ‘ They are not mad. They're trained to believe, not to know. Belief can be manipulated. Only knowledge is dangerous. ’ What seems most dangerous is the knowledge of what is to come and the lack of freedom to escape fate. This novel delves deeper into ideas of memory as well as looking to the future with characters like Alia that have memory accessible in her cells to converse with the ancestral past. It becomes very existential, with question if there is any agency to truly make choices, locked into political decisions as well as the awareness of the future. Paul is set up much like the Nietzschean Übermensch yet in this novel he rejects it and wishes to escape it. ‘ My steps fit into it so precisely that I fear most of all I will grow bored reliving the thing so exactly, ’ he says, which also feels a nod to Nietzche’s concept of Eternal Return . What unfolds is brilliant and becomes an excellent example of refusing the body for the myth. While the end is sad and tragic, it is also a cementing of immortality as the eternal Maud’dib, now more legend and legacy than ever before. Messiah is a shorter sequel that packs a lot of power on the smaller scale while managing to make the universe vastly larger and more complex. There is much distrust stirred in this book, with distrust in rulers, history and religion being a major purpose for Herbert. In an essay by his son, Brian Herbert , he mentions how his father saw the Watergate scandal as a positive: ‘ By amplified example, albeit unwittingly, the thirty-seventh president of the United States taught people to question their leaders. ’ This message of questioning leaders, especially ones who impose moral codes through religion and seek to dismiss critical historical perspectives as execution-worthy heresy is at heart in Messiah . Legacy and fate are critical themes, as well as breeding schemes that will determine the future ruler of Arakkis. This is an excellent passing of the torch that slingshots us towards the next book, and the Dune series marches on. 4\/5 ' If you need something to worship, then worship life - all life, every last crawling bit of it!

        "text":"3.5 * I read Dune 9 years ago, thought it was perfect and left it there. Since then, I’ve debated whether I should read the follow up. I had two fears, one, that it would not be as good as the 1st in the series and, two, that things will go very badly for Paul and his Jihad. I was right on both accounts. On Saturday, I saw Dune 2 which was a masterpiece. In its aftermath, I was elated and then I felt a deep sadness and emptiness. When I read that Villeneuve almost finished the script for the 3rd Part, I decided to take the plunge and read Dune Messiah. I am content with my decision, although it wasn’t as good as the first and I felt depressed all the time I was reading it. “No matter how exotic human civilization becomes, no matter the developments of life and society nor the complexity of the machine\/human interface, there always come interludes of lonely power when the course of humankind, the very future of humankind, depends upon the relatively simple actions of single individuals.” This review contains spoilers for Dune and minor ones for this novel. Many complained that this is a boring book and that nothing happens in it. I fully disagree. Oh, the novel has problems but not these ones. I mean, ok, if you expect epic battles, you won’t find them in here. What you will find are plots over plots and a lot of internal struggle. It was not boring, I mean you do not need a large attention span to finish this book. It is a lot shorter than its predecessor and a fast read. The novel starts 12 years after the events in Dune. Paul Atreides is now the Emperor, the most powerful man in the Universe and he feels very, very unhappy and guilty. “To endure oneself may be the hardest task in the universe. There’s no writ of inquest or calling of witnesses to provide answers. No servant—or disciple—can dress the wound. You dress it yourself or continue bleeding for all to see.” At around 40%, we find the hard facts of his discontent: “Statistics: at a conservative estimate, I’ve killed sixty-one billion, sterilized ninety planets, completely demoralized five hundred others. I’ve wiped out the followers of forty religions”. A feat hard to achieve in terms of destruction. His only comfort is that “he had seen enough alternate Timelines to know of worse possibilities than accepting godhead for himself. Much worse.” “You can’t stop a mental epidemic. It leaps from person to person across parsecs. It’s overwhelmingly contagious. It strikes at the unprotected side, in the place where we lodge the fragments of other such plagues. Who can stop such a thing? Muad’Dib hasn’t the antidote. The thing has roots in chaos. Can orders reach there?” Paul is not the only one with issues. Many of the remaining powers try to kill him and even part of the Fremen are unhappy about the way their world changed, now that they have time to think. “Empires do not suffer emptiness of purpose at the time of their creation. It is when they have become established that aims are lost and replaced by vague ritual.” The Bene Gesserit Reverent mother, Scytale, a face Dancer Bene Tleilax, a guild navigator and empress Irulan meet to plot against Paul. They sent him a gift, a Ghola, a sort of clone made of Duncan Idaho’s dead flesh. They somehow program it to kill Atreides when activated. Paul is unable to refuse to have his childhood friend beside him, even though the ghola retains no memory of his past life. At the same time both Empress Irulan, Chani, the consort are desperate to sire a hire to the throne. Irulan feeds Birth control to Chani in secret while Muad’dib refuses to touch his wife. I confess that I’ve read the plot before starting. I wanted to know what I was getting into, my own power of prescience. Already knowing the plot, it allowed me to concentrate on the writing. I was able to enjoy the philosophic dialogues that I also appreciated in the original Dune, but also to see the problems. By far, the biggest issue I have with this book is how the author wrote women and all the nauseous sexual innuendoes concerning Alia. I will elaborate for each character because it pissed me off. I was surprised by these choices since Dune had some powerful women. •\tIrulan: She was present only at the beginning to moan that she wasn’t getting it from Paul and that she wanted a child so badly. So much so that she decided to conspire with the enemy. •\tChani: Poor woman is only a cardboard character here, a submissive thing and only a vessel for Muad’Dib’s heir. I remember that she had some sort of personality in the novel so I was very disappointed. •\tJessica: The powerful Jessica decided she has done enough and retired on Caladan, letting her offspring to ruin the world without her. She only sent a pointless letter This is so unlike Jessica to stay behind and not try to scheme. •\tThe Reverend Mother had some interesting interventions until she suggested that Paul and his sister should mate to produce a suitable heir from a genetic point of view. Later, she is brought back for a diatribe against IVF. It really reminded me that this book was written in the 60’. Or it could have ben set in Alabama. •\tAlia. Ok, I will try to write this without puking. In this book Alia is 15, going on 16 and apparently on heat. At some point, the author makes her fight naked and when Paul sees her, he realizes that she became a woman and almost gets a hard-on. Grose. And then there is talk about finding her a mate, later she feels a “post-coital sadness” and so on. Oh, and Duncan kisses her. I understand that she has the memories Jessica and all the Reverend Mothers before her but still, she looks like a 15 year old girl. WTF Herbert? The parts involving Paul, his internal struggles, the dialogues with his friends and enemies were all good, some excellent. They touched me and I felt sorry for him. I wanted to absorb some parts of this book inside me. However, I could not understand some of the author’s decisions. Well, as Paul said “There are problems in this universe for which there are no answers,” Paul said. “Nothing. Nothing can be done.” Some more quotes: The flesh surrenders itself, he thought. Eternity takes back its own. Our bodies stirred these waters briefly, danced with a certain intoxication before the love of life and self, dealt with a few strange ideas, then submitted to the instruments of Time. What can we say of this? I occurred. I am not … yet, I occurred. “We must not grieve for those dear to us before their passing.” “Before their passing,” Paul whispered. “Tell me, little sister, what is before?” All it required was water … and love. Life changed those irascible wastes into shapes of grace and movement, he thought. That was the message of the desert. Contrast stunned him with realization. He wanted to turn to the aides massed in the sietch entrance, shout at them: If you need something to worship, then worship life—all life, every last crawling bit of it! We’re all in this beauty together!"

        "text":"It´s mainly a psychological warfare battle with psi weapons, many conspiracies, less action, and very good dialogues. Some favorite elements: Sci-Fi pregnancies are always a fertile ground for plot ideas, bad pun intended, and as each mother of any species and epoch wants the best for the unborn and has the healthiest diet possible, there is one question that comes with pregnancy enhancing drugs and magical substances turning embryos in mentalists. Especially when pimping the baby in the womb is totally safe and nothing can go wrong anymore or each complication and problem can immediately be solved thanks to very advanced future medicine, the mother loses the legitimation to refuse any optimization possible, because it would actively harm the child by reducing the chances in the future and in competition with others, something already in discussion regarding genetic engineering nowadays. If it´s magic powder and its quality and quantity that decide over the future career of the child as a doctor, engineer, or god-emperor, it´ a bit trickier to find the right amount, because there are no mini- and nanobots patrolling the body scanning around. You know, I guess even fictional characters´ bodies might have different tolerances and biochemistries so how does a woman decide how much is too much and will the eyes of the kid glow too blue or too less and is a too less even desirable if it includes lower potential? If it´s already shining trough the womb during pregnancy, it might be just the right dosage. The world with shapeshifters, clones, psi powers, breeding programs, and intrigues that are distilled in a much smaller area than in the first novel, intensifying the suspense of so many different fractions competing with another. Philosophical, political, social, ethical, and moral questions in vast amounts, I would like to know how many books and ideas Herbert used to create the philosophy of the world and its protagonists and would be interested in a list of the references and how he modified and changed all the ideas, there is certainly a wiki, Reddit, or blog dealing with this. Diving deeper in this second dimension of the story might only be possible when rereading or regularly stopping while reading to reflect on what has just been said and to try to put it in the context of the whole story. It was so cool and could have been much longer, everything is perfect here and there would have been the potential for double the size with all the suspenseful elements and open questions. And the dialogues, it´s not often the case that there is something to read like that, so go for it.

And then I read Messiah and was pretty much completely dissatisfied. Not enough to give it a poor rating, since it is interesting (I mean, we all still care about Paul, even if he is a whiner) and it did keep my attention. You haven't seen foreshadowing until you've read Dune Messiah . It takes that to a whole new, grotesque level. And pretentiousness. Thought Dune was pretentious? Hah! This one makes Dune look like a chimney-sweep in comparison. It's as though Frank Herbert managed to make a blunt weapon out of pretentiousness and use it directly on the reader's mind. My final impression was of just another massive philosophical acid trip consisting of a bunch of people smarter than me bandying hints and portentous minutiae in the middle of a half-realized desert wonderland for over three hundred pages. And I didn't really care about Duncan Idaho, anyway, since he was only in Dune for like forty pages and he only spoke about twice. Telling me ten times in a row that Paul really really liked Idaho is not going to make me feel the same way about him, Frank Herbert! Now I'm afraid to read number three."

Since I had psychic powers, it seemed pretty crazy not to use them to gain some respect. Before I knew what had happened, I was the clan's leader. And you get some momentum, you want to keep it up, otherwise you just go backwards. Suddenly I found I was ruling the planet. I didn't expect it to be quite so easy to conquer the known Universe, but that bit always catches you by surprise. On the way, I met this girl.

About half the size of the original, it feels like a simply bridge to Children of Dune than an actual sequel to Dune. But the theme of the story is one that Frank Herbert must have believed personally and that is Think For Yourself. People are not gods. Gods are not governance. To deify politicians and world leaders is a can of worms that should never be opened. Fans of the original fell in love with Paul Atreides and to see him essentially as a flawed leader with clay feet left a bitter taste in many mouths. So, again, it's easy to understand the criticism. It's like if Empire Strikes Back came out and Luke turned out to be just some dude who was more lucky than gifted. I’ll always recommend reading Messiah and Children of Dune together. Because as a stand alone, Messiah vanishes under the vast shadow cast by its predecessor."

Unfortunately, I'm one of those readers where if the writing style doesn't suit me, the rest probably won't either. It took me days to finish the three-hundred-pages book, which usually takes me a day or two when I like the story. I think that in itself shows how much I enjoyed it. I must admit that the ending made me want to continue it, but I think I should take a short break from the world of Dune, because sadly for me this is not the type of series that I could binge read in a week. Maybe these are the type of books that I need to savor slowly to understand them better, or just like them more, I honestly don't know, but despite my low rating here, I will probably continue this series one day, when the right time comes."

        "text":"Having re-read Dune (and reviewed it here on GR) recently, I figured I should continue and read at least the initial trilogy with Dune Messiah and Children of Dune to get a better idea of the world that Frank Herbert created. I am glad that I read Dune Messiah. It is an excellent novel about destiny and fate and how much of it we can control. We get more insight into the Navigators - here I noticed that, unlike in Dune, we actually meet a Navigator (one of the three primary conspirators against Paul Maud'dib) which means that David Lynch most have read this book as well before making his cult classic movie of the first book. We also learn more about the Bene Geserits and the Mentats. I found it particularly fascinating that the Butlerian Jihad, which takes place a few hundred years before the action in Dune and Dune Messiah, was actually, if I understood correctly, a war of humans against machines which the humans won. Following this victory, computers were banished from the known universe and instead Mentats and Navigators (inspired by melange made from spice) were bred to be human computers for political and financial strategy in the former case, and for navigation in space-time for the latter. This fascinated me because I have read and watched so much science fiction where the machines win (or are winning) such as in Ghost in the Shell or Neuromancer, or Blade Runner, or Hyperion and Dune is one of the rare universes where humans won and yet, at what cost? Banning machines seems to have brought humans back to a medieval society with its aristocracies (House Corrino, House Harkkonen, House Atreides) and oppression and genetic manipulation (Bene Gesserit). And once the Fremen rally around Paul to destroy two of the three houses and install Paul as the new Emperor and as the Dune Messiah, is this new regime really a new start for humanity or just another autocratic regime. It sure looks like that latter and we get inklings of this as the Fremen go spread the Gospel of their Maud'dib and subsequently spilling not just a little blood. All of these things continue to torture Paul as they did in Dune and yet he is inevitably driven forward by this messianic destiny. Enter the conspiracy of a Bene Gesserit priestess, a rogue Navigator and a strange Face Dancer who want to topple Paul's regime, well more specifically kill his Fremen wife and force him to sleep with his sister Alia (ewww!!) so as to continue the genetic engineering project and re-install the old regime over which each had more control than under Paul. Another piece of the puzzle here is the reappearance of Duncan Idaho, mentor and friend to Paul as a Zensunni master which has unintended consequences. Zensunnism in itself is a fascinating blend of Sunni Islam and Zen Buddhism that also is followed by the Freman. In essence, Herbert created a universe where classic monarchal hegemonies come into conflict with religious fanatics - in a sense we can see the Fremen hordes as marauding Zen Buddhist priests in ancient Japan fighting the Emperor, well that is one image that came into my mind anyway, so as not to wear out the old Western capitalism vs Islamic obscurantism trope. While perhaps less expansive and mind-blowing than the first Dune, Dune Messiah still delivers punches as a great plot with convincing characters and lots of philosophical questions. On to Children of Dune! I have since finished the whole canonical series and enjoyed all of it. [UPDATE] I am looking forward to Denis Villeneuve's Dune in October 2021. The previews I have seen so far seem to be quite coherent with respect to the book. I was a fan of Lynch's Dune and am curious to see what Villeneuve does with this one. Feel free to comment below.

        "text":"I really liked Frank Herbert's classic science fiction novel Dune when I first read it a few months ago --so much so that I named it one of the best books I read that year. But upon finally getting around to the sequel, Dune Messiah I'm pretty disappointed. It's really boring. Don't get me wrong, I can see some of the impressive literary clockwork that Herbert assembles in the book. Where Dune told the story of Paul Muad’Dib's rise to the Emperor, controller of the universe's only source of the coveted super spice \"melange,\" and general badass dude, Messiah tells the story of his downfall. It also follows through on one of the more interesting concepts introduced in the first book: Paul's spice-induced ability to foresee the eventual species-wide extinction of humans and the hard choices he has to make in order to steer history towards a lesser evil. Indeed, Messiah fast forwards to a point where Paul's fanatic followers have propagated a holy war that has destroyed entire planets and left over 60 billion people dead in just a few years. By those measures, Paul is the worst monster history has ever created, yet he has to bear the mostly private burden of knowing that he's killing all those people to save the race as a whole while simultaneously trying to outmaneuver his political opponents and crafty assassins. Angst! The problem I have with Messiah is that it suffers acutely from a kind of talking head syndrome. It's not until the back sixth or so of the book that anything interesting happens. Dune had sword fights, skirmishes, Paul and his mother tromping around the deadly desert of Arakis meeting and learning about the Fremen, and all other kinds of adventures. Messiah devotes literally dozens of pages at a time to sitting in a room listening to conspirators talk to each other. And then talking about what the talking means. And then thinking about what the talking about the talking means. It's terrible and jarring to see how Herbert has switched gears so abruptly from fascinating adventure and world building to stark exposition and naval gazing. Not that some of the ideas aren't interesting. The way that Paul must grapple with his precognition and how he has to grasp at things to try and leave humanity on the path to survival in the wake of his inevitable fall is a complex and fascinating idea, for one. And I liked the idea of how his strengths are the things that ultimately do him in --sometimes literally. It's just that I wish Herbert had found ways to make this story less tedious in its execution. Is the third book any better? I'm on the fence at this point."

        "text":"Buddy read with Athena ! \"Once more the drama begins.\" - The Emperor Paul Muad'dib on his ascension to the Lion Throne Twelve years have passed since the Battle of Arrakeen, where Paul Atreides wrestled the Imperium from the hands of the Padishah Emperor, and seized the Lion Throne for himself. Dune has become the political and economical centre of the universe, and the Qizarate priesthood has spread Muad'dib's name throughout space and turned him into not only an emperor with absolute power, but a god in his own right. Yet there are those who would topple the god emperor from his religious throne. In the grand circles of power, a new conspiracy arises from the shadows. Its goals and ambitions are many, and it seeks to infiltrate the ranks of the Atreides and the Fremen, striking at those closest to the emperor in order to remove him from power. And each step brings its plans closer to succeeding. \"Mysterious, lethal, an oracle without eyes, Catspaw of prophecy, whose voice never dies!\" Dune Messiah is, in many ways, even better than Dune . It cannot stand up to the wonder of discovering the world of Arrakis for the first time, but it certainly has other strengths. The setting and the writing style is mostly the same as in the first book. The story though, has changed dramatically. The first book is about Paul Atreides and his quest for vengeance against those who betrayed his family and seized their land. The second book is about managing an empire and protecting it from a devilishly dangerous conspiracy who shuns no means to achieve what they want. There is more political maneuvering, more hidden agendas, and more excitement for the reader. The character have also grown more interesting in the second book. Paul, Chani and Irulan are all older and more experienced in the games of power, and were much more enjoyable to read about than they were in the first one. And perhaps the most fascinating character of them all is Alia, Paul's sister. Still only fifteen years of age, she is both a Reverend Mother of the Bene Gesserit, a leader of the Qizarate priesthood, and a powerful voice in the Imperial Council. What truly made me decide to let this book keep the five stars from the first time I read it, was the ending. I will not go into details about it, but only say that this may be the most beautiful ending I have ever read in a sci-fi or fantasy book ever. For those of you who have read Dune and are debating with yourselves whether or not to read its sequels, I hope this review will be helpful in deciding. For those of you who haven't read any of the books from this universe, know that it is in my eyes one of the greatest fictional series of all time. I would definitely recommend it to every single one of you, because it's a wonderful story with few equals in the world of science fiction. Such a rich store of myths enfolds Paul Muad'dib, the Mentat Emperor, and his sister, Alia, it is difficult to see the real persons behind these veils. But there were, after all, a man born Paul Atreides and a woman born Alia. Their flesh was subject to space and time. And even though their oracular powers placed them beyond the usual limits of time and space, they came from human stock. They experienced real events which left real traces upon a real universe. To understand them, it must be seen that their catastrophe was the catastrophe of all mankind. This work is dedicated, then, not to Muad'dib or his sister, but to their heirs - to all of us. - Dedication in the Muad'dib Concordance as copied from The Tabla Memorium of the Mahdi Spirit Cult"

        "text":"When I first read Dune Messiah , it was nearly twenty years ago and like a lot things time had erased most of the details from my brain - including the ending. So digging into it last week was a treat; felt like something new. From re-discovering characters and themes, to gaining an understanding that my seventeen-year-old brain wasn't able to yet comprehend. As a note on my assessment style: Part of me wants to respond to other reviewers here on Goodreads concerning their literary criticisms. However, I’ve found that to be a self-defeating endeavor. I come from the school of: A review should stand on its own merits. But I have a little cheat here - I can respond to what my younger self thought of Dune Messiah . The Nick West of twenty years ago did have some criticisms of this book that may have been rooted in misunderstanding — and at the very least, a sense of disappointment or superb literary let-down. As I respond to Nick of the 90s, you can parallel similar themes in other 2 and 3 star reviews on this site. So here we are: You the reader, Nicholas at age 37, and Nick at age 17. Let’s chat. **(There is one specific thing I do want to address concerning other reviews, because it’s a weirdly specific critique that pops up a bunch of times. But we’ll get there in a minute.)** Off the top here, I loved this book. I had it on my Goodreads for 10 days, but really I ate up the bulk of the text in a three day page-burner. Here’s something that Nick, age 17, could not fully realize about Dune Messiah : This is a novel for grown ups. Gone is the fairy-tale magic of a young man forced into extraordinary circumstances. Gone are any aspects to the beginnings of the hero’s journey. Instead, we get the biggest realization that Nicholas at age 37 has had about the Dune series: Those aspects of fantasy and science fiction tropes that got me into the story, seemingly became absent concepts in Book Two. While not incidental , those surface elements are incidentally the thing that I got hung up on the first time I read this series. And they weren’t even the most important things in the saga. Frank Herbert has this reputation for making Dune some impenetrable document as rigid, complicated, and vengeful as the Old Testament. But that’s a bad rap. On the surface, the first Dune book was a seemingly simple story of betrayal and revenge. The world building, interpersonal relationships, religious philosophies, and political intrigue are as deep as anything ever put into fiction. (The vengeful part is, however, accurate.) So, when teenage Nick finished Dune ; what felt like the most epic journey my imagination had ever been on, only to crack open the next book and feel like I was thrust into the pages of a bad pulp novel, it felt a bit confusing. I read the prologue which contained on-the-nose dialogues by some nameless jailer and a historian. Okay? — The empire of Paul Maud’dib has a Spanish Inquisition team? The next chapter introduced me to Face Dancers, gaseous fish-men, and a conspiracy to kick the book into gear — It is a little pulpy. But the Harkonnens are pretty damn pulpy too. As adversaries they are supervillain-gaga. Maybe you just missed it missed it because of how epic the story was around them. Geez, young Nick, you didn’t realize it was pulp all along. With a healthy dose of psychedelia and the best world building since Tolkien. As to the confusion of the prologue, turns out that’s just a clever way to deliver exposition on what became of the Universe since Paul ascended to emperorship: It’s been twelve years since the first book, etc… Pulp might be the wrong word. But the heart of the matter is that Herbert had a vision (visions!) in which he used Dune , Book One, to dip a toe in, or maybe a foot. But with Dune Messiah , we definitely went waist deep. What’s third base in a swimming mixed metaphor? I think Frank Herbert reached his hand down my pants from a psychedelic standpoint. But I’m skipping ahead. Nick at 17 was let down. My expectations had been subverted. Dune Messiah isn’t about the Shakespearean characters performing hyper-slick action scenes. No. Book Two in the series is much more contemplative. We jump into new dramas between old characters and fresh faces. And yes, teenage Nick, there is a hell of a lot of talking. But to call that boring or hard to follow betrays an unrefined mind, kid. This novel is a procedural of emotion, passion, pleasure, the struggle with mortality — you know, the human condition — Not only did Frank Herbert up his literary game; he did so with a brevity and beauty that was perfect for this story. And what we think of as a slow burn actually has new twists and intrigues on practically every other page. If you pay attention, which the writing makes easy to do, the payoff is a powerful one indeed. On that note: Paul Maud’dib is dealing with some heavy stuff as Emperor of the known Universe. He had allowed (Or he claimed it as out of his control) a horrible Jihad to rage across the universe. This Holy War is what I struggled with the most both times I read the novel — and perhaps Herbert was using this as a way to expand the reader’s consciousness? (This is a meta theory if you tie it into the Ghola\/Hayt\/Duncan Idaho’s fate. Whoa. There’s a thesis, man���) You really have to open up new channels of thought to figure out why Paul could not stop evil from being done in the Atreides name. Was there really was no order of events or commands that could’ve stopped the Fremen conquerers? There was a series of events that could control the Jihad! It just took Paul twelve years to make it work! So now we get into the goods. Here’s what makes this book such a killer, twelve-round-fight-with-a-knockout-punch, genius piece of literature. Paul faces several huge problems that seem insurmountable. And he feels trapped by his prescience. If one could see the future and decided on a certain path, the sheer boredom would be brutal. But there is still too much fear for the boredom to kick in. There is a complicated conspiracy against him that is so powerful, even his knowledge of the plot cannot stop its machinations. Paul must produce an heir. If this is done improperly, the love of his life would be tortured and turned into a slave. the Jihad must be stopped. The unbalanced government fueled by religious zealots needs to be set on a more progressive track. That’s quite a tall order for 329 pages. On top of that, we are told in the prologue about Paul’s downfall. So now we’re faced with a whodunnit?, or more of a howdunnit? Will the conspirators win the day? Can Paul cement a legacy that reaches beyond violence? Can Chani bear a child that lives? So we sit through all the meetings, and conversations that take place jumping between multiple points-of-view. We delve into character’s deepest thoughts, passions, desires, and inadequacies — something that Herbert can actually pull off. What could have been a mess of massive internal dialogues, instead becomes a string, a chord, and finally a cable pulling the reader forward page by page. Yes, young Nick. How could you understand the anxiety a father feels for his children? Or a husband for his wife of more than a decade? You really can’t. Frank Herbert wrote a book for grown ups. And when you’re all grown up, you might catch a bit of what was trying to be conveyed. All the while being heaped with a massive dose of trippy visions pulling you into the undertow of genetic and higher-thinking philosophies. Before we realize what he’s done, Herbert has crafted the perfect ending to Paul’s journey. It is melancholy and poetic. And after chapters of Paul’s nihilistic despair and frenetic energy, he is given peace. You try writing something half as spectacular. So, teenage Nick, give it some time, buddy. Dune Messiah comes highly recommended from you, a man who has changed a little bit over the last twenty years. — **Finally here’s that weird note that pops up in a bunch of Goodreads reviews. I’ll go ahead and quote some actual reviews here (Of course, I’m not going to call out individual names. I’m not here to pick a fight. These reviewers have just as much validity in their feelings towards the book as I do.) Bolds added by me.— “I'm realizing there's not much to this book. It simply bridges the first and third.” “After re-reading Dune recently, I decided to finally get around to reading Dune Messiah - the sequel to Dune and the bridge to Children of Dune.” “I read in reviews all over the Internet that it was boring that it was basically only a bridge between DUNE and CHILDREN OF DUNE.” “For me Dune Messiah acts as a slightly dull (but not too shabby) bridge to go on to the original trilogy’s grand finale Children of Dune\" (This next one says the same thing but surprisingly doesn’t use the key word, BRIDGE . Seriously, what is going on here?) “The feel of the book is like a prelude to what comes next, that the third book will be the true sequel to Dune.” “This is not to say I didn't love the book -- far from it! It definitely feels like a bridging book between \"Dune\" and \"Children of Dune”” You get the point. At least 30 different reviews used this terminology in my quick scan. Firstly: What the hell is going on? Did everyone read each other’s reviews and just spew the same points using their own re-ordered sentences? Is there some secret Dune -whisperer-critic that said this is a “bridge” novel and that became reality for everyone else? Seriously, wtf? Secondly: I think most of these folks are wrong. You could stop the series at Dune Messiah and have a really satisfying ending to Paul’s journey. Honestly, Messiah is one of the best damn endings I’ve ever read. It’s a magic trick where the cards are face up the whole time and you’re still left wondering how Frank Herbert pulled it off. Good stuff, Mr. Herbert. Young Nick, ignore these “ bridge ” acolytes. I don’t trust ‘em. :P"

        "text":"Hace mucho tiempo que tenía ganas de leer la secuela de Dune y ahora que por fin lo he hecho me ha dejado sentimientos encontrados. Es un relato que arranca 12 años después del final de la primera parte y va a mostrarnos en qué ha ido a parar el imperio galáctico a manos de su nuevo emperador. Es un libro mucho más lento, reflexivo y filosófico que el anterior... esto por norma general suele gustarme, pero en esta ocasión hubo muchas partes que me resultaron confusas y hasta la mitad de la novela (que además es bastante breve) no conseguí interesarme verdaderamente por lo que estaba ocurriendo. Por otro lado el desenlace me encantó y me ha dejado con muchísimas ganas de leer la siguiente parte con la próxima generación. Creo que todos los que amaron la primera parte conseguirán disfrutar de esta en mayor o menor medida, tiene más intrigas políticas, más corrupción espacial, más worldbuilding fascinante y lo más importante de todo... más bene gesserit. *******Alia gracias por existir *******Jessica vuelve"

        "text":"Sometimes one book is enough. Sometimes less is more. Sometimes a story needs to be left alone. I have never been more disappointed with a sequel in my entire life. It’s that bad I wish I never read it and I also wish that the author never wrote it because it adds absolutely nothing to the franchise. I’m so surprised at how poor it is. I’ve heard that the series gets worse with each book, and I can’t imagine how it could get any worse than this. So, I’m going to stop right here and save myself writing anymore negative reviews and wasting my time with bad writing. The main problem is that nothing really happens. The plot is non-existent, which is surprising considering just how intricate the first book is. The world is huge, and Herbert could have done so much with it. Instead, he extended the story further than it should have been and the consequences are dire. The only point of interest, a resurrected character from the first book, fails to deliver the drama and tension he appears to bring with his presence. Ultimately, because the first book is just so fantastic, the sequels will only ever be compared to it. It’s how these things work. A series needs to be consistent in its imaginative power and it needs to be consistent in its drive and quality. This is so weak compared to the first book that I could only ever be disappointed. Whilst there are some interesting aspects, they suffer because the plot stays so stationery and frets over the ethics of religious jihad and Paul’s impassivity in the face of his destiny. I also found the mention of real-world historical figures a little odd considering there was no mention of anything like this in the first novel. There is a comparison between Paul and Hitler, as Herbert considers who has killed more people during the act of conquest. And this threw me totally off because the series seemed very self-contained. It’s like Richard III being mentioned in a Star Wars novel when the universe wasn’t built on ours initially. This totally destroyed any sense of immersion in the plot. Herbert should have just stuck to one book or, better yet, actually wrote a decent sequel or something new. ___________________________________ You can connect with me on social media via My Linktree . __________________________________"

        "text":"Oh, man, where the fuck do I really even start? When I've read Dune last year I fell head over heels in love with it. It had been such a long time since I've read a chunky sci-fi\/fantasy novel and I seriously didn't expect to love that book, its characters, the world building, and its plot as much as I did. Empires do not suffer emptiness of purpose at the time of their creation. It is when they have become established that aims are lost and replaced by vague ritual. And even though Dune had a somewhat closed ending, I was still curious to see where Paul Muad'Dib would end up. What would happen to Arrakis under his rule? To the Fremen? To the whole universe? I've heard many interesting takes on the series as a whole, and I am mainly interested in the philosophical questions of power, worship and human control over nature that it raises. Therefore, I knew that I had to give Dune Messiah a shot, to piece the puzzle together, and to get more answers. I didn't nearly love it as much as I loved Dune . Dune had the big advantage of everything being new. I was introduced to Arrakis, to the Atreides, the Harkonnens; I saw the ornithopters, the Fremen stillsuits and the sandworms for the first time; I started to grasp the complexity of this world that Frank Herbert created. Whereas in Dune Messiah , albeit the world has changed, it still feels oddly familiar. To me, the sequel didn't feel as fresh or new or even original. It felt more like the traditional sci-fi novels that I usually stay clear off. In Dune , Paul was a young boy who led a revolution against the tyranny of the Padishah empire. However, when he ascended the throne as emperor, a jihad got unleashed in his name, leading to the death of 61 billion people. He became a failed hero. Heroes who fail to recognise their humanity fall into an abyss of desolation forged from the failures they encounter once realism dawns on them. There exists no separation between gods and men; one blends softly casual into the other. Dune Messiah shows how deadly religion can get once it has a cause that fuels it. Paul knows that even if he were to disappear or die, he wouldn't be able to stop the jihad, he'd simply become a martyr, a God, fuelling the jihad even more. The people fighting in his name have become fanatics, succumbed to a cause that will never let them out of its grips. There are problems in this universe for which there are no answers. Nothing. Nothing can be done. In Dune Messiah , we find many interesting musings on power and freedom: \"Power tends to isolate those who hold too much of it. Eventually, they lose touch with reality … and fall.\", \"Any delusions of Free Will he harboured now must be merely the prisoner rattling his cage. His curse lay in the fact that he saw the cage.\", and \"Too much freedom breeds chaos.\" I wish I had found the time (or energy) to contemplate these a lot more, because I really like how Herbert subverts the (white) savior trope in this series. Paul is a failed hero. And for that, he is the most interesting character in these books. We see the paradoxes surrounding him. So, I really like what Herbert has to say about the nature of power, and how it corrupts (not just the person who holds it but also the cause for which it is used), however, I have to admit that I haven't (yet) dived deep into an interpretation of the series. I think I will save that for when I've finished Children of Dune . I can't wait to read all the hot takes and watch video essays on it. Now let's discuss some of the things I really didn't enjoy this book – and why it ultimately left me a little bit disappointed. Similarly to Dune , Frank Herbert's writing style is just really not my cup of tea. I don't think that his writing is beautiful nor effective. Whilst I love his world building and appreciate the complexity of the universe he created, I have to admit that I struggle with visualising any of his descriptions. Therefore, I was very happy that I could bounce off the visuals of Denis Villeneuve's new film. They really helped me picture the world whilst reading. However, as new characters and elements of the world are introduced in Dune Messiah , I struggled with visualising them. It's not that Herbert doesn't describe them, it's just how he does it that doesn't work for me. I always end up picturing the most ridiculous things possible. For example, if you compare Herbert's descriptions of the members of the Spacing Guild – \"Edric swam in a container of orange gas … The Guildsman was an elongated figure, vaguely humanoid with finned feet and hugely fanned membraneous hands – a fish in a strange sea. His tank’s vents emitted a pale orange cloud rich with the smell of the geriatric spice, melange.\" – to Denis Villeneuve's cool design for the movie: It's not hard to pick a favorite. Herbert's description seems so ... weird? A fish-like figure swimming in an orange gas tank? What is that supposed to look like? How is that practical for the story? How does Edric move forward? Isn't he super vulnerable because people could just break his tank?? What is happening? Whereas in the movie, the Spacing Guild looks fucking epic, even intimidating. They have a much more Star Wars -y design. And I can take them seriously. In the movie, they are much more believable. Another example is the Dune Tarot. Up to this day, I don't understand what its function is or how it even works. It's an oracular tool (basically Tarot cards?) sold in markets on Arrakis. For some reason, that is never properly explained, the existence of the Tarot muddles Paul's and Alia's ability to see the future. Wait, what? How? And why? Because there are more prophets. It makes no sense. Also, just picturing Fremen dealing with Tarot cards is too fucking funny to me. Again, it's a part of the world that would've probably been really cool and epic in the films, but in the book, I fail to take it seriously. My biggest gripe with Dune Messiah , however, is what Frank Herbert did to the character of Alia. She had such great potential in Dune , being the youngest and most powerful Reverend Mother, I couldn't wait to see her as a teenager (she is 15 at the beginning of Dune Messiah ), so that she could become more integral to the plot. Instead of fleshing out her character and giving her an important role (which would suit her powers), Herbert does nothing but sexualise her throughout the entirety of the novel. It was frustrating, and even disgusting at times, but let me elaborate: It all started going to shit right off the bat, when the Tleilaxu admit that their plan is to distract her by making her fall in love with Hayt: \"She is of an age when she can be distracted by a charming male designed for that purpose. She will be attracted by his maleness and by his abilities as a mentat.\" So, you're telling me, one of the most powerful creatures of this universe will get distracted and lured into a trap by a man? Umm, okay, sure. Keep on dreaming, Herbert. I really don't understand why Herbert was so obsessed with stressing the point that now, at age 15, Alia has her sexual awakening: \"It was lust in tension with chastity, she thought. Her flesh desired a mate. Sex held no casual mystery for a Reverend mother who had presided at the sketch orgies.\" I mean, what is happening??? Why is that necessary?? Paul didn't go through a sex-crazy phase when he was a teenager in Dune , so why must Alia? The lowest of low points was the scene in which Alia decides to do target practice naked: \"Abruptly, Alia climbed dripping from the bath, strode wet an naked into the training chamber which adjoined her bedroom.\" The whole scene was so muddled by the male gaze it was hard to bear. Women do not enjoy fighting naked. It's not practical, Herbert. Titties bouncing all over the place. It hurts. And the way Herbert described this naked 15-year old (!!!) girl – \"Sweat glistened on her naked skin.\" – made me very uncomfortable. It was disgusting. When Alia is discovered by her brother Paul and Stilgar, Frank Herbert once again showed that he's a man and doesn't understand teenage girls: \"Alia, growing conscious of her nudity, thought to cover herself, found the idea amusing. What the eyes had seen could not be erased.\" Absolutely not. Girls don't find it amusing when their brothers see them naked?? What is going on with you?? In general, Herbert tried to establish somewhat of a sexual tension between Alia and Paul (...who is 30 at this point, mind you – AND HER FUCKING BROTHER) – \"Paul took his time reading the reactions on her face and body: the flush of her exertions colouring her skin, the wet fulness of her lips. There was a disquieting femaleness about her that he had never considered in his sister.\" – and I wasn't here for any of that. It was soooo unnecessary to the plot, and just disgusting. When Paul noticed that \"Yes – there’d been a ruttish air about Alia.\" I actually wanted to throw my copy of the book away. I mean, what the fuck is going on here, Frank? Can we focus, please? Another way that Alia was thrown under the bus in this novel is her relationship to Hayt\/Duncan. Alia, the most powerful and most KNOWLEDGEABLE creature in the universe (having absorbed all the knowledge of all Reverend Mothers before her), becomes a naive and silly girl in front of Hayt and his \"male confidence\" (her words, not mine...). At the end of the book, she literally says to him: \"'I need you, Duncan,' she sobbed. 'Love me.'\" Are you fucking kidding me? How about you start using your powers and choosing your own destiny, instead of relying on this man (who kissed you without your consent btw)??? So yeah, Alia's character went DOWN THE DRAIN, and I'm still pissed about it. Anyways, what follows now is a very short summary of Dune Messiah – which I will use for further reference once I get to Children of Dune (ya'll know that my memory is like a sieve) – so please beware of spoilers: Twelve years after Paul Atreides's ascension as emperor, the death toll of the jihad unleashed in his name peeks 61 billion people. Paul gains total control of Melange's production, making him the most powerful emperor to have ever ruled. Using his prescience, Paul tries to create a golden path for humanity. “I’ve killed sixty-one billion, sterilised ninety planets, completely demoralised five hundred others. I’ve wiped out the followers of forty religions which had existed since.” The Bene Gesserit, Spacing Guild, and Tleilaxu come together to plot a plan that will lead to Paul's dethroning. Reverend Mother Gaius recruits Princess Irulan, Paul's consort, to work on the inside, and she does so by adding contraceptives into Chani's food, preventing her from conceiving for Paul. However, Chani gets pregnant after using a Fremen fertility diet. Scytale, the face dancer from the Tleilaxu, brings Paul a gift of Duncan Idaho's ghola, called Hayt. Paul's acceptance of Hayt creates a rift between him and the Fremen. Paul discovers a Fremen plot to kill him and confronts his opposition. Paul gets blinded by a Stone Burner. Paul tries negotiating Chani's life in exchange for artificially inseminating Princess Irulan. As foreseen, Chani dies in childbirth, and Hayt attacks Paul but recovers his former self. Paul kills Scytale by using his son's eyes after having received a prescient vision from the perspective of his newborn son. Paul then loses his own prescience in the act. Paul leaves his new twin babies in Alia's care and walks into the desert as a man as per the Fremen tradition. Alia orders the execution of Paul's enemies, including Reverend Mother Gaius and Edric. However, she spares Princess Irulan."

        "text":"If you ask any first-time reader of ‘Dune’ where he or she thinks the story is likely to go in the follow-up, I doubt if anyone could have predicted ‘Dune Messiah’. It does not work as a book, as there is really no beginning, just a slow (very, very slow and exposition-laden) flat-line of a narrative that gives a slight blip at the overly dramatic ending, which is clearly meant to set-up ‘Children of Dune’ rather than end the second book in any satisfactory fashion. I think ‘Dune Messiah’ is much better-suited as the last part of ‘Dune’ itself, where it would function as a reflective coda deconstructing the consequences of the preceding events. Clearly, ‘Dune Messiah’ did little to deter the juggernaut that the Dune books would ultimately become. It had about as much effect as poor old Paul trying to avert the jihad and prevent humanity going off the rails of civilisation. Paul spends pretty much the entire book in an existential funk, pondering his increasingly opaque and contradictory visions (much to the frustration of the patient reader, who still has no clue as to what it is he is actually ‘seeing’.) In a throwaway line so typical of much of the off-hand nature of ‘Dune Messiah’, as if Herbert was deliberately trying to avoid emulating anything that characterised the previous book (and that had made readers fall in love with it), Paul compares notes with fellow ‘emperors’ Genghis Khan and Hitler: “Statistics: at a conservative estimate, I’ve killed sixty-one billion, sterilized ninety planets, completely demoralized five hundred others. I’ve wiped out the followers of forty religions…” This is well into the book’s last act, and does make the reader raise an eyebrow. Oh, so that’s why Paul is in such a bad mood! Apparently, it is barely 12 years after the ending of ‘Dune’, a rather odd number that I’ve seen bandied about but don’t recall being referenced in the actual text. A vast bureaucracy known as the Qizarate has arisen to administer (and temper) the religious fanaticism that has arisen around Paul. A pilgrimage route known as the ‘hajj’ is well-established by now, with Arrakis as its ultimate destination, ensuring that the Qizarate’s coffers are always overflowing. Jessica, however, wants nothing to do with this: Despite the special reverence held for Caladan as the place of Paul’s birth, the Lady Jessica had emphasized her refusal to make her planet a stop on the hajj. “No doubt my son is an epochal figure of history,” she’d written, “but I cannot see this as an excuse for submitting to a rabble invasion.” The main plot of ‘Dune Messiah’ concerns the machinations of a ‘fellowship’ of disparate stakeholders drawn into an uneasy alliance with the common purpose of unseating Paul from his throne. Herbert is always very precise about his terminology, and I am sure his reference to a ‘company of conspirators’ is a deliberate inversion of how the term ‘fellowship’ is used in ‘Lord of the Rings’, for example, the other contemporary countercultural novel that ‘Dune’ is often compared with. While we have the usual suspects like Mohiam and Irulan, it is the new characters and players introduced into the mix that really elevates ‘Dune Messiah’ into something special. If you thought ‘Dune’ could not get any weirder than the quasi-mystical mumbo jumbo of the original, then ‘Dune Messiah’ quickly makes you realise that Herbert still has quite a number of cards up his sleeve (there is a lovely riff on the Dune Tarot set throughout the book.) Bijaz, described as a dwarf Tleilaxu oracle, is a weird combination of Falstaff from Shakespeare and Chucky from the Child’s Play movies, and would not be out of place in a David Lynch movie. Speaking of Lynch, he obviously nicked Edric the mutated Guild Navigator straight from the pages of ‘Dune Messiah’, turning it into an indelible image in SF cinema. Herbert seems to be a fan of baroque excess, as evinced by the flamboyant and thoroughly despicable Baron in ‘Dune’. In ‘Dune Messiah’, however, he introduces yet another shadowy player that is potentially even more perverse and grotesque, the Bene Tleilax. Just where the hell did they come from? Despite the ancient proscription on using computers that arose from the Butlerian Jihad, the Tleilaxu is clearly the predecessor of LexCorp, always flirting with dangerous technology: The Tleilaxu displayed a disturbing lack of inhibitions in what they created. Unbridled curiosity might guide their actions. They boasted they could make anything from the proper human raw material—devils or saints. They sold killer-mentats. They’d produced a killer medic, overcoming the Suk inhibitions against the taking of human life to do it. Their wares included willing menials, pliant sex toys for any whim, soldiers, generals, philosophers, even an occasional moralist. The best demonstration of the overriding creepiness of the Bene Tleilax, of course, is their presentation of a special gift to Paul, a ghola of Duncan Idaho himself, plucked from the battlefield and reanimated like Frankstein’s monster in an axolotl tank (clearly an inversion of the Fremen death still). Alia of the Knife, whom Herbert often reminds the reader is on the cusp of her womanhood, as if there is a noxious whiff of the Baron still hanging around, is immediately turned on by Hayt, the ghola’s Tleilaxu name. Not subtle at all, Herbert. Alia attempts to work off some steam by sparring with an updated version of the fighting machine that Paul used on Caladan in ‘Dune’ (this one even has flashing lights.) Except she does so in the nude. Yes, sex rears its head in ‘Dune Messiah’ like Shai Hulud popping up out of the sand. (A lot of SFX ingenuity in Lynch’s 1984 ‘Dune’ went into preventing the sandworms looking like questing penises. Lynch was only partially successful, but that could have been deliberate on his part.) Herbert reminds us that orgies were a commonplace occurrence in the Fremen sietch (if you recall, Paul first had sex with Chani in the spice-induced orgy after he kills Jamis in single-handed combat.) We even get a quotation from Chapter 3 of The Steersman’s Guild, entitled ‘THE ORGY AS A TOOL OF STATECRAFT’. And as if the Bene Gesserit weren’t in the reader’s bad books already, here they hatch a desperate plot to attempt to get Paul to fuck his sister. “…[T]hat stubborn fool of an Atreides! How could he deny the jewels of posterity within his loins?” Poor sexually-deprived Irulan wonders idly about Edric the Guild Navigator as a potential fuck buddy, “thinking how odd it would be to mate with such a one.” This, mind you, during the first meeting of the conspirators that opens the book, where her mind should be focusing on the larger issues and not be in the gutter (or Edric’s tank, as it were.) Mohiam fondly calls Lady Jessica a “traitorous bitch”, who in turn is told by Scytale: “You are not a sex object, have never been a sex object, cannot be a sex object.” Ouch. That had to hurt as much as the gom jabbar. Ah, Scytale. Described as a ‘Jadacha hermaphrodite’, he (pronouns weren’t as advanced in 1969 when ‘Dune Messiah’ was published), can assume either sex at will, and is commonly referred to as a Face Dancer. “For the present, I am a man,” he declares. The reader is not convinced, because there is something even oilier about Scytale than that uber-creep the Baron. It is especially uncomfortable because Herbert seems to signpost a latent effeminacy or sexual ambiguity in Scytale as being fundamentally wrong. It is clear that a lot of the convoluted sexual politics of ‘Dune’, wrapped up as it were in Herbert’s own subconscious biases towards misogyny and homophobia, begin to, er, come into play in ‘Dune Messiah’. ‘Dune Messiah’ is the literary equivalent of a ‘spice blow’, which is the result of immense pressure building up within a pre-spice mass deep within the sands of Arrakis. (Of course, this is what killed Liet Kynes when he rather stupidly went to lay on top of one in ‘Dune’.) At only about a third of the length of the original novel, so much is packed into ‘Dune Messiah’ that a spice blow is inevitable. Herbert’s writing is always at its most delicate and evocative when he turns to Arrakis itself, and ‘Dune Messiah’ is no exception. He clearly has a deep and abiding love for the desert world he has created, which is a tabula rasa of the natural world despoiled by humanity and its increasingly dramatic and uncontrollable impact on our own planet. There is a wonderful scene near the end when Chani returns to her sietch to give birth (and precipitate the crisis that launches the next book in the sequence): Windblown sand whipped at her, reddened her cheeks. She glanced over her shoulder at the frightful band of dust across the sky. The desert beneath the storm had taken on a tawny, restless appearance as though dune waves beat on a tempest shore the way Paul had once described a sea. She hesitated, caught by a feeling of the desert’s transience. Measured against eternity, this was no more than a caldron. Dune surf thundered against cliffs. The storm out there had become a universal thing for her—all the animals hiding from it...nothing left of the desert but its own private sounds: blown sand scraping along rock, a wind-surge whistling, the gallop of a boulder tumbled suddenly from its hill—then! somewhere out of sight, a capsized worm thumping its idiot way aright and slithering off to its dry depths. As far as I recall, this is the only worm sighting in the entire book, apart from a side plot involving a bunch of Fremen traitors capturing a small maker to take it off-planet and start the spice cycle on a similar world. Ah, but they don’t know about the sand plankton that is such an integral part of the sandworm lifecycle, which is probably what George Lucas had in mind when he started tinkering with the role of midichlorians as an essential component of the Star Wars universe. Herbert continues: Sietch odors assaulted her nostrils. The place was a ferment of nasal memories—the warren closeness of bodies, rank esters of the reclamation stills, familiar food aromas, the flinty burning of machines at work...and through it all, the omnipresent spice: melange everywhere. She took a deep breath. “Home.” Extraordinary. And it is exactly as if the reader him- or herself has returned home, to the deep desert of Arrakis where it all began. Chani’s viewpoint is reflected in Paul’s own perspective: Ugly, barren land! He imagined it sun-soaked and monstrous with heat, a place of sandslides and the drowned darkness of dust pools, blowdevils unreeling tiny dunes across the rocks, their narrow bellies full of ochre crystals. But it was a rich land, too: big, exploding out of narrow places with vistas of storm-trodden emptiness, rampart cliffs and tumbledown ridges. All it required was water...and love. Life changed those irascible wastes into shapes of grace and movement, he thought. That was the message of the desert. Contrast stunned him with realization. He wanted to turn to the aides massed in the sietch entrance, shout at them: If you need something to worship, then worship life—all life, every last crawling bit of it! We’re all in this beauty together! Yes, I know that this is Herbert at his most ‘hippy dippy’ – and it is certainly no surprise that a novel as batshit crazy as this would have such a deeply Age of Aquarius moment in it. But, for me, this is still one of the most remarkable, and memorable, passages in the entire saga. It is the ‘Circle of Life’, writ boldly on the ever-shifting sands of Dune."

        "text":"Segunda entrega de la extraordinaria saga de Frank Herbert, Las crónicas de Dune, considerada una de las más importantes sagas de CF de todos los tiempos. Una joya memorable y atemporal que será siempre el desierto de Arrakis. El mesías de Dune continúa la historia de Paul Atreides, mejor conocido – y temido -, bajo el nombre de Muad’Dib. Como emperador del universo conocido, posee más poder del que jamás debió ejercerun solo hombre. Venerado como ídolo religioso por los vehementes Fremen, Paul se enfrenta a la hostilidad de las castas políticas que desplazó cuando asumió el trono, así como una conspiración dentro de su propio círculo de seguidores. Aunque la Casa Atreides ya comienza a desmoronarse a su alrededor por las intrigas de sus enemigos, la verdadera amenaza para Paul vendrá de su concubina, Chani, y de su hijo nonato, heredero de la dinastía familiar. El mesías de Dune tiene un tono y un estilo completamente diferente al de Dune. Dune estaba lleno de aventura e incluso una arenosa esperanza, todo un grupo trabajando, dispuesto a morir para transformar y cambiar el entorno. Además, Dune tenía un montón de personajes muy fuertes. Por el contrario, el mesías es más político y emocional. El tono en este ha sido más oscuro que el de Dune y no tan inspirador y filosófico. El final del mesías fue un poquito decepcionante, todo lo contrario del final de Dune. O yo tengo el primero en un pedestal y todas las comparaciones son odiosas. Miedo me da el tercero que he leído que para muchos fue algo innecesario. No es tan épico, es casi como un western con muchas intrigas políticas y con referencias a ciertos acontecimientos, pero muy poca acción por no decir inexistente. La sensación del libro es como un preludio de lo que viene después, el tercer libro para mi será la verdadera secuela de Dune. Para los fans de Dune, sin duda, y realmente necesitáis haber leído Dune para conocer a los personajes y tener una idea sobre la compleja e intrincadamente detallada construcción del mundo de Herbert. No deja de ser una genial lectura de lo más entretenida ya que volver a Dune es siempre una idea cojonuda..✍️🎩"

        "text":"Returning to the original world of Dune has a special place in my heart. I seem to recall that Messiah was written before Dune but obviously Dune was published before it. Of course, a beginning is the time for taking the most delicate care that the balances are correct. This every fan of Frank Herbert knows. To begin your study of the life of Dune, then, take care that you first place this in its proper time. Know then that it is the year 2021 and all the covidiots and Q factions have taken over the universe. What was once an act of glorious revenge against a teetering empire has now become an entrenched tragedy. Reading Dune Messiah is the tragedy that we deserve. Taken over by religious zealots, icons over careful deliberation, countless dead instead of a stable empire. But that's where the comparison fails. Paul, unlike any of us, has a much clearer idea of the future, being able to see it, however imperfectly, and he is caught in a web of intrigue and guile and that beautiful sliver of hope hidden in the future that only his eyes see, where only perfidy, assassination, and betrayal seems to be his new bed. Twelve years after the end of Dune, Alia is a teenager and a bright star. Irulan wants an heir to the Empire, Chani is a devoted but flattened character, as is Paul, as all futures grind down to singular points. The time of crisis comes and tragedy, depression, and horror awaits. But at least there is a copy of Duncan Idaho. Now a mentat, a tool of assassination -- and a human computer -- his role captures Paul as hardly anything else could have. Honestly, for years, I thought this one was the worst of the Dune books. But mostly that's because I cared too strongly for Paul, never wanted to see him fall. In actuality, the book is delightfully intellectual and complex, showing us so much more about the Fremen and the pitfalls of a religion-based monarchy and the hellish pitfalls of prescience. Being a god is not all it's cracked up to be. And in a moment or two, Paul's son is going to ask his papa to hold his beer."

        "text":"Secondo romanzo del ciclo di Dune. Sono trascorsi dodici anni da quando i Fremen hanno dato seguito alla loro profezia ed hanno massacrato mondi interi. Il nome di Muad'dib è tuttora, nella galassia, sinonimo di morte. Il tema centrale del romanzo è il pericolo di idolatrare un leader carismatico. Paul non è più il giovane duca in ascesa, ma un imperatore tormentato. La sua jihad, scatenata nel primo libro, ha provocato la morte di miliardi di persone, e lui è prigioniero del suo stesso potere e della sua profezia. Si esplora la linea estremamente sottile tra un salvatore e un tiranno, tema ripreso abbondantemente nel quarto romanzo. Paul è diventato un simbolo incontrollabile, e la sua stessa esistenza è la causa di una violenza che non può fermare. A differenza del primo Dune, che era pieno di battaglie e avventura su larga scala, Messia di Dune ha un ritmo più lento e introspettivo e si concentra sull'intrigo politico e sulla psicologia dei personaggi. Il romanzo mostra le lotte interiori di Paul, la sua prescienza che è sia una benedizione che una maledizione, e il suo disperato tentativo di sfuggire a un destino che ha previsto ma non riesce a evitare. Herbert critica la fede cieca e l'esaltazione religiosa, un avvertimento contro la creazione di figure divine e l'abbandono del libero arbitrio a favore di una religione o di un leader. La prescienza di Paul lo mette di fronte a un paradosso: vedere il futuro significa anche esserne schiavo. La ricerca e la lotta per trovare un \"Sentiero Dorato\" che salvi l'umanità dall'estinzione, anche a un costo personale altissimo. Vengono introdotti personaggi chiave come il ghola di Duncan Idaho, Hayt, che aggiunge un ulteriore livello di introspezione sulla natura dell'identità e della manipolazione. La principessa Irulan, che nel primo libro era una figura quasi marginale, qui assume un ruolo più attivo. Il rapporto tra Paul e Chani, messi alla prova dagli intrighi di palazzo e dalla prescienza di Paul, diventa il cuore emotivo del romanzo. Messia di Dune è un romanzo più filosofico e meno spettacolare del suo predecessore, ma è un tassello essenziale per comprendere la visione completa di Herbert. Mostra le conseguenze del trionfo e distrugge l'idea del salvatore per mostrare la fragilità e il peso del potere assoluto. Qualcuno ha il coraggio di definirla letteratura di evasione...ahhahahah ----------------------------- The second novel in the Dune series. Twelve years have passed since the Fremen fulfilled their prophecy and massacred entire worlds. The name Muad'dib is still synonymous with death throughout the galaxy. The central theme of the novel is the danger of idolizing a charismatic leader. Paul is no longer the rising young duke, but a tormented emperor. His jihad, unleashed in the first book, has resulted in the deaths of billions, and he is a prisoner of his own power and his prophecy. The novel explores the extremely fine line between savior and tyrant, a theme revisited extensively in the fourth novel. Paul has become an uncontrollable symbol, and his very existence is the cause of a violence he cannot stop. Unlike the first Dune, which was filled with battles and large-scale adventure, Dune Messiah has a slower, more introspective pace and focuses on political intrigue and the characters' psychology. The novel reveals Paul's internal struggles, his prescience, which is both a blessing and a curse, and his desperate attempt to escape a fate he foresaw but cannot avoid. Herbert criticizes blind faith and religious exaltation, a warning against the creation of divine figures and the abandonment of free will in favor of a religion or leader. Paul's prescience presents him with a paradox: to see the future also means being its slave. The search and struggle to find a \"Golden Path\" that can save humanity from extinction, even at great personal cost. Key characters are introduced, such as the Duncan Idaho ghola, Hayt, who adds a further layer of insight into the nature of identity and manipulation. Princess Irulan, who was almost a peripheral figure in the first book, takes on a more active role here. The relationship between Paul and Chani, tested by palace intrigue and Paul's prescience, becomes the emotional heart of the novel. Dune Messiah is a more philosophical and less spectacular novel than its predecessor, but it is an essential piece to understanding Herbert's complete vision. It shows the consequences of triumph and destroys the idea of ​​a savior to demonstrate the fragility and weight of absolute power. Someone has the courage to define it as escapist literature...hahahaha"

        "text":"Dune Messiah By Frank Herbert A Dune Retrospective by Eric Allen Four years after the publication of Dune, those who cried out for a sequel were finally answered. Frank Herbert returned to Arrakis for a book that was very different from the action packed first volume of the series, but at the same time, still held a lot of the familiar. When I tell people that I actually enjoyed the sequel to Dune more than the original, the answer I get from the overwhelming majority is, \"Wait . . . Dune has a sequel?\" People know of Dune nowadays through the 1984 cult classic movie. Some people may be vaguely aware that the movie was based on a book, but never bothered to pick it up or look for sequels. Which is a shame, because they're missing out on this little gem of a book. Twelve years after taking the throne of the empire for himself in Dune, Paul \"Muad'Dib\" Atreides has become something of a God, or Savior figure to the Fremen, who have taken up arms and spread out throughout the entire known universe bringing a Holy War to subjugate all beneath his rule. All of this, very much against Paul's own wishes. He has become a figurehead, standing atop the empire as Emperor, while priests of the religion that worships him rule in his name. He has made good his promise to begin turning Dune into a paradise, and now the desert runs freely with water. Another sign to his followers of his godhood. Princess Irulan, Paul's trophy wife, and the means by which he secured the throne is anxious to follow her Bene Gesserit orders to bear the royal heir, but Paul has no love for her and refuses it to her, instead remaining true to his real, Fremen wife Chani. This leads Irulan to join a conspiracy against the Emperor, meant to discredit him, destroy his reputation, and take the wind out of the Fremen Zealots' sails. Out of spite, she has been feeding Chani contraceptives to prevent her from ever bearing Paul an heir, but this plan failed, and Chani conceived anyway. It is discovered that Fremen are part of the conspiracy against Paul, and while meeting with a man to get the names, Paul is blinded in an attempt on his life. Through the powers of his oracular sight, he can still see, though his body is blind. Long story short, after Chani dies in childbirth, Paul wanders into the desert alone, blind and broken, never to be seen again, and leaving the Empire in the hands of his sister Alia until his children are old enough to assume rule. The Good? Again, Frank Herbert did a ridiculous amount of research before writing this book. It shows in how he truly understands the mechanics of economics, politics, and religion. The religion that he has built up around Paul is intriguing, and realistic, and the atrocities that its zealots commit in his name feel logical, and realistic as well. Paul's suffering under the burden of the sins of those who follow him is really well done. This book is more a character study on him, than really anything else, showing the impact his actions have had on him as a person. This is a very different kind of book than the first in the series. Where the first book was all about war, this one is all about the consequences of it on the man that started it all. Despite its short length, this book has a very big and important message, and it delivers it exquisitely. Many people tend to complain that this book is rather boring after the first one, but I found Paul's inner struggles to be just as, or perhaps even more entertaining than the battles of conquest and Paul's coming of age, etc from the first book. This book is remarkably better written and put together than the first book. Not only did Frank Herbert apparently do quite a bit of research in the four years between books, but he also improved on his skills as a writer quite a bit. The storyline is tighter, less convoluted and far less confusing than that of the first book. It almost reads like something written by a completely different writer because of the increased quality of the writing, and the change of focus, but at the same time, it still has his unique style and flair to it. The Bad? I have never liked the Third Person Omniscient perspective that Frank Herbert uses. This is where the story is told by a narrator in third person that will change viewpoints between characters at the drop of a hat, without warning when any given character has any important thoughts or observations on what's going on. I find it to be rather confusing and distracting at times, and I've always thought of the style as rather amateurish. This is wholly a point of opinion, and true, many very good books are written in this particular perspective, but I don't like it, and will always count it as a bad mark against any book it appears in. Frank Herbert doesn't really seem to \"get\" female characters. He doesn't really seem to understand what motivates women, how they think, how they act, how they talk, and why they do the things that they do. Going by his female characters, one could almost say that he never met a real woman in his life. As such, they are basically just men with breasts. They have all the right girly bits, because someone in the universe has to, but the their minds and personalities are about the furthest thing from feminine as is possible. Back in the '60s this was a VERY common thing, which is getting somewhat better these days, but still lingers on. Frank Herbert's portrayal of women fits those of the times, but to anyone that might be, or has ever actually met, a real woman before, it's going to feel a bit off. Back in the day this sort of thing was acceptable, but I find it to be annoying and distracting, if not downright offensive, in this day and age. In conclusion, Dune Messiah is a VERY different type of book than its predecessor Dune, and it does have its vices, but the good more than outweighs the bad by far. The focus on Paul's dilemma with the Jihad that he inadvertently started is spectacular. Watching his inner turmoil over the countless billions that have died in his name play out is excellent. And if the female characters are off, everything else is dead on. He's created a fantastic world, with fantastic people (if you think of them all as men, anyway) to live in it, and did a great deal of research to make everything from the economics to the religion feel realistic. As an entry in the Dune Saga, it's probably one of the best. Check out my other reviews."

        "text":"I'm very much looking forward to Villeneuve's interpretation of Dune that will be shown in theaters this year so I decided to not only read the original book but also the rest of the series. After seizing power and becoming emperor by marrying Princess Irulan, Paul (well, his forces, but in his name nonetheless) has sterilized hundreds of planets, killed billions of people ... and hates his own Jihad (I loved Scytale's description of it being a mental epidemic). Paul doubts the justice and righteousness of the path he has chosen, his powers of vision encounter more and more limits, and the number of people opposing the new emperor grow ever more. Even some Fremen despise Muad'ib now. While Paul and his now 15-year-old sister, Alia, rule with a council, Irulan joins a conspiracy to kill Paul. Simultaneously, Chani wishes for nothing more than to be pregnant again (not knowing that Irulan has slipped contraceptives into her diet, thus preventing a pregnancy so far ) but Irulan herself demands the privilege of bearing her empirial husband's child (and is refused, unless she accepts artificial insemination). As if all that wasn't enough, the Navigator Guild establishes an embassy on Arrakis and brings a gift (funny, considering the German word Gift): a genetic copy of Paul's former friend and teacher, Duncan Idaho. He has a part to play, of course, knows and reveals as much as he knows about it even, but things are ... complicated. Once again, everything is shrouded in lies and mysteries and tarots, partially revealed by and often misunderstood thanks to visions. So yes, there is a lot of intrigue and personal drama here. Where the first book was about fear and self-awakening, this second one more carried the tones of self-hatred and being trapped. What I especially liked about this book is that it addressed the conflict attentive readers saw coming in the previous book: how Paul had seized power and what he presented himself as to his followers could only lead to disaster. Not to mention the downside of his powers, the price he has to pay for them. Yet there were good reasons for him to do what and how he did (preventing annihilation for humanity). Nevertheless, seizing the throne is way easier than keeping it. And religious fanatism always carries within itself the seed of its own destruction. Naturally, the sandworms still are vital to the machinations and events. Here, plans are set in motion to create another melange \"factory\" on another planet. Then there were the further revelations of the complicated genetic tapestry the Bene Gesserit have weaved, the consequences, the history (for example, they aren't the only ones with such planning and Paul apparently isn't the first Kwisatz Haderach )! Personally, I liked and dreaded Alia and \"Duncan\" getting along so well since I know where it leads to (if the mini series Children of Dune follow the book(s) faithfully) - good and bad, necessary and preventable. Likewise, I knew what would happen to Chani , also thanks to the mini series Children of Dune , but hated it and was hoping it would be different here - which was, of course, impossible. In a way, Paul wasn't wrong when he said this way was better for their children - both parents out of the picture. Yet it is hard to believe. So I was definitely emotionally invested and appropriately devastated. This book, then, offers an important insight into Paul's conflict with himself and his different personas\/potentials. It also shows the same kind of insight into Alia's mind (very important considering her having awakened to Reverend Mother awareness before she was even born and, no doubt, her future role). Last but not least, it sets the tone and places important corner stones for future developments. Because if you thought this series was about Paul, you better think again! A short-ish book, very cerebral with little actual action but still thrilling thanks to the reader excitedly following the path and the story being rounded off by the periodical interludes in the fashion of historical assessments and commentary, all of which is vital to the overall mythology and establishment of important characters that will carry the rest of the saga forward. It doesn't hurt that the author is so good at making you care about certain people in a short amount of time. P.S.: Don't let the rating fool you, this is not quite as good as the first novel. It is neither as vast in scope nor as intricate. However, it is intricate in its own way, very smart, and the rating system here is limited. This scifi book is definitely in a league of its own, too."

        "text":"Philosophical and intricate, on the corrupting influence of power and opulence, combined with the unchanging march of time and the prison predestination can be Empires do not suffer emptiness of purpose at the time of their creation. It is when they have become established that aims are lost and replaced by vague ritual. Ceremony and symbolism taking over belief and morality, similar to how success on the battlefield made elite soldiers pampered and materialistic, and all that after just 12 years. Dune Messiah opens up differently than one might imagine after Dune , not with the problems of the Jihad (and the 61 billion dead it caused, which we are told in passing by Frank Herbert ) but focusing rather on the corrupting influence of enormous power and wealth. Forces are stirring against Paul and his reign, mimicking Newton’s “every action has an equal and opposite reaction” and Hegel’s pendulum take on history, but the biggest danger to the emperor comes from time and the burden the visions themselves bring with them. Bastions of power are destroyed and own power is reinforced in the end, albeit at the cost of a highest of sacrifices. I would call this book brilliant in concept, but my heart was never really touched. There are golems, resurrected flesh, vast bureaucracies and massive conspiracies. But the characters, maybe due to their elevated perception of time, feel ephemeral and going through the motions, instead of being in the moment acutely in danger. Alia, sister to Paul, being sexualised and incest being part of some plans, strikes me as very Egyptian pharaoh like. Also the whole insta love surrounding her and some other main character felt sloppy. And then we have Chani being nearly invisible, maybe speaking five sentences in the whole book... Still I am sure I will read into Children of Dune at some point, yet this sequel in my view could not stand up against Dune . Quotes in both Dutch and English: Reason is the first victim of strong emotion They are not mad. They're trained to believe, not to know. Belief can be manipulated. Only knowledge is dangerous Maar het was nou eenmaal het onvermijdelijke lot van macht om belegerd te worden Deze is praatziek maar wel diepzinnig Een keizer is meer dan een mens, zijn persoonlijkheid leidt het rijk Dit was geen lichtzinnig gedane gift, hij gaf eerlijke antwoorden op gevaarlijke vragen Truth suffers from too much analysis Zij bewoog het zwaard niet, het zwaard bewoog haar We kunnen niets voor eeuwig voorkomen Alle macht is beperkt Uw vernietigen sire? Kan iemand een god doden? Hoe kan hij zichzelf tegen zichzelf beschermen? Daar geloof je niets van dus waarom zou je het zeggen? De mensen willen geen boekhouder als keizer maar een meester, iemand die hen beschermd tegen veranderingen Jouw waarachtigheid is gevaarlijk Je bent dronken van teveel tijd Jij bent bang voor je eigen macht Je troost me met doorns Here lies a toppled god. His fall was not a small one. We did but build his pedestal, A narrow and a tall one. You do not beg the sun for mercy. Mijn regering is de economie Was het een nederlaag als je van twee kwaden de minste kiest? Te veel vrijheid kweekt wanorde Hij hield hen allen in de palm van zijn visioen De macht die zelfs de allemachtigsten kunnen uitoefenen zonder zichzelf te vernietigen is begrensd Ik zal doen wat de liefde van me verlangd Ik sterf aan mijn eigen voorzienigheid Maar er zijn problemen in dit heelal waarvoor geen oplossing bestaat There are problems in this universe for which there are no answers. Nothing. Nothing can be done."

        "text":"Completely Different Tone Than Dune #1 Dune #1 leaves us in a complete cliffhanger. However, Dune #2 starts up 12 years later. In the introduction to the version that I read, Brian Herbert (the author’s son) wrote that one magazine labeled this book as the “disappointment of the year.” However, he explained the book is supposed to show how absolute power can corrupt leaders including Paul Atreides. Dune Messiah has a completely different tone than Dune. Dune was filled with adventure and hope, the entire group working, willing to die, to transform the environment. Further, Dune had a bunch of very strong female characters. In contrast, Dune Messiah is more political and emotional. Also, the depiction of women is just horrible. Alia is boy crazy, and Irulan and Chani are only focused on Paul and producing an heir. In 12 years, Paul has matured. He is not the boy of Dune. He makes decisions almost cavalierly. The book was definitely entertaining though. The audiobook had an entire cast of characters, and it was such a rich experience. As with Dune, I could pick something up new each time reading Dune Messiah. However, the tone on this was much darker than Dune, and it wasn’t inspiring. The ending of Dune Messiah was so weak, the complete opposite of the ending of Dune. Recently, I was reading a list ranking all of the Dune books, and this one was rated the very worst of the series so I am still excited to continue with this series and hope that the future is a little less bleak. 2025 Reading Schedule Jan\tA Town Like Alice Feb\tBirdsong Mar\tCaptain Corelli's Mandolin - Louis De Berniere Apr\tWar and Peace May\tThe Woman in White Jun\tAtonement Jul\tThe Shadow of the Wind Aug\tJude the Obscure Sep\tUlysses Oct\tVanity Fair Nov\tA Fine Balance Dec\tGerminal Connect With Me!

        "text":"Only half the length of the original Dune , the second book in the series takes place 12 years after. Not as epic, this is almost like a chamber western, with political intrigue and references to great goings on, but little action described. The feel of the book is like a prelude to what comes next, that the third book will be the true sequel to Dune. For fans of Dune, no doubt, and you really need to have read Dune first, to know the characters and to at least have a clue about Herbert's complex and intricately detailed world building. But then, comparing this book to Dune is like comparing a country lawyer to a Supreme Court justice, the comparison itself is unfair, very few books will equal Dune or even come close. Dune Messiah is part of Herbert's great vision and is a good book in its own right. *** 2019 Reread Coming back to this book years later and after having read all of the first six that Frank Herbert, I have a better appreciation for Herbert's great vision. Describing a conspiracy against Paul after his conquest of the Universe, and devastation of myriad worlds and billions of lives lost, the author creates a setting of disquiet, as Leto's time in the Dune universe begins. Herbert's literary grasp of theology, ideology and spiritualism is on full display and this is an important book in his canon."

        "text":"‘ I live in an apocalyptic dream. ’ When the wheels of fate are churning, can you escape without being crushed beneath its wheels. Frank Herberts set up an amazing and complex political universe and sets it to explode, sending us off on a trajectory picked up by Dune Messiah . Set 12 years after the events of Dune , we find Paul Maud’dib on the Emperors throne and the Jihad has ‘ killed sixty-one billion, sterilised ninety planets, completely demoralised five hundred others ’ all in Paul’s name. Messiah has vastly expanded mechanics yet resides in a much smaller scale than its predecessor, being almost a parlor drama of ‘ plots within plots within plots ’ as before but with a more focused proximity to really feel the tension creaking through the narrative. Expanding on themes of the ways religion and politics are manipulated for power and diving deep into ideas of fate and freedom with a touch of Friedrich Nietzsche along the way, Dune Messiah is a tense and psychological thriller that really drives home the ideas left open at the end of the previous novel and charts a course for incredible new directions for the larger narrative. While the original Dune plays out on epic proportions, Messiah feels more like a Greek tragedy. Withing a few chapters of the opening we see the plot drop into the chamber and be fired off with a pretty clear indication what it leads, yet every step of the way still feels fresh and thrilling. This is in keeping with the story as well, seeing as Paul foresees much of what is coming but after a decade of winning and no surprises, a psychological challenge that could be unexpected is what he craves. ‘ He felt chained to a future which, exposed too often, had locked onto him like a greedy succubus, ’ Herbert writes, and Paul, feeling isolated from even those he loves due to his prescience while increasingly speaking with Alia on their shared struggle, begins to wish for a way to escape his all-knowing fate. This becomes increasingly tragic when he can see great loss before they happen and the only advice his sister can give is ‘ we must not grieve for those dear to us before their passing ’ The story feels a bit more loose and less tidy in this one, an obvious difficulty when constructing a narrative around prescience. Yet the political tensions and plottings keep it sharp and direct, and where Herbert really excels is getting into character’s heads during discussions and seeing the internal mastermining going on. This is especially exciting with Scytale, a Tleilaxu Face Dancer that can shift into any body because if Bene Gesserits weren’t enough, this shapeshifting class only hinted at before is now on full conniving display to remind you that the Dune universe is terrifying and awesome. It is a tight cast, with less than a dozen primary characters including the return of Duncan Idaho as a clone, or ‘ghola’, also going by the name Heyt. Which, as expected, becomes an issue with the Fremen who see technology such as this as potentially blasphemous. Scytale warns ‘ reason is the first victim of strong emotion ’ and much of Messiah is mental chess full of strong emotions to throw Paul off his game. It’s pretty dark, considering he knows Duncan has been sent to probably kill him and it’s his friend yet not his friend at all as boisterous Duncan is now a stoic and pensive intellectual. ‘ Truth suffers from too much analysis. ’ -Ancient Fremen Saying Messiah seems hellbent on reminding you that the events of Dune were not a heroic and great thing but a pretty twisted political contest of colonialism, manipulation and mass murder. Like murder on the galactic scale of genocide. The Jihad is not awesome and people are starting to talk about that. The opening pages are an intense interview with a historian about to be executed for writing a critical historical analysis of Paul and his rise to power, and he tells the Fremen ‘ you learned early to call the truth heresy. ’ The ruling powers dismiss anything not in keeping with their narrative, one held firmly together by the glue of religion. ‘ Religion, too, is a weapon, ’ Herbert writes, and asks us ‘ what manner of weapon is religion when it becomes the government? ’ We begin to see the religious gaslighting to keep a strong and obedient population ready to kill. ‘ They are not mad. They're trained to believe, not to know. Belief can be manipulated. Only knowledge is dangerous. ’ What seems most dangerous is the knowledge of what is to come and the lack of freedom to escape fate. This novel delves deeper into ideas of memory as well as looking to the future with characters like Alia that have memory accessible in her cells to converse with the ancestral past. It becomes very existential, with question if there is any agency to truly make choices, locked into political decisions as well as the awareness of the future. Paul is set up much like the Nietzschean Übermensch yet in this novel he rejects it and wishes to escape it. ‘ My steps fit into it so precisely that I fear most of all I will grow bored reliving the thing so exactly, ’ he says, which also feels a nod to Nietzche’s concept of Eternal Return . What unfolds is brilliant and becomes an excellent example of refusing the body for the myth. While the end is sad and tragic, it is also a cementing of immortality as the eternal Maud’dib, now more legend and legacy than ever before. Messiah is a shorter sequel that packs a lot of power on the smaller scale while managing to make the universe vastly larger and more complex. There is much distrust stirred in this book, with distrust in rulers, history and religion being a major purpose for Herbert. In an essay by his son, Brian Herbert , he mentions how his father saw the Watergate scandal as a positive: ‘ By amplified example, albeit unwittingly, the thirty-seventh president of the United States taught people to question their leaders. ’ This message of questioning leaders, especially ones who impose moral codes through religion and seek to dismiss critical historical perspectives as execution-worthy heresy is at heart in Messiah . Legacy and fate are critical themes, as well as breeding schemes that will determine the future ruler of Arakkis. This is an excellent passing of the torch that slingshots us towards the next book, and the Dune series marches on. 4\/5 ' If you need something to worship, then worship life - all life, every last crawling bit of it! We're all in this beauty together! '"

        "text":"3.5 * I read Dune 9 years ago, thought it was perfect and left it there. Since then, I’ve debated whether I should read the follow up. I had two fears, one, that it would not be as good as the 1st in the series and, two, that things will go very badly for Paul and his Jihad. I was right on both accounts. On Saturday, I saw Dune 2 which was a masterpiece. In its aftermath, I was elated and then I felt a deep sadness and emptiness. When I read that Villeneuve almost finished the script for the 3rd Part, I decided to take the plunge and read Dune Messiah. I am content with my decision, although it wasn’t as good as the first and I felt depressed all the time I was reading it. “No matter how exotic human civilization becomes, no matter the developments of life and society nor the complexity of the machine\/human interface, there always come interludes of lonely power when the course of humankind, the very future of humankind, depends upon the relatively simple actions of single individuals.” This review contains spoilers for Dune and minor ones for this novel. Many complained that this is a boring book and that nothing happens in it. I fully disagree. Oh, the novel has problems but not these ones. I mean, ok, if you expect epic battles, you won’t find them in here. What you will find are plots over plots and a lot of internal struggle. It was not boring, I mean you do not need a large attention span to finish this book. It is a lot shorter than its predecessor and a fast read. The novel starts 12 years after the events in Dune. Paul Atreides is now the Emperor, the most powerful man in the Universe and he feels very, very unhappy and guilty. “To endure oneself may be the hardest task in the universe. There’s no writ of inquest or calling of witnesses to provide answers. No servant—or disciple—can dress the wound. You dress it yourself or continue bleeding for all to see.” At around 40%, we find the hard facts of his discontent: “Statistics: at a conservative estimate, I’ve killed sixty-one billion, sterilized ninety planets, completely demoralized five hundred others. I’ve wiped out the followers of forty religions”. A feat hard to achieve in terms of destruction. His only comfort is that “he had seen enough alternate Timelines to know of worse possibilities than accepting godhead for himself. Much worse.” “You can’t stop a mental epidemic. It leaps from person to person across parsecs. It’s overwhelmingly contagious. It strikes at the unprotected side, in the place where we lodge the fragments of other such plagues. Who can stop such a thing? Muad’Dib hasn’t the antidote. The thing has roots in chaos. Can orders reach there?” Paul is not the only one with issues. Many of the remaining powers try to kill him and even part of the Fremen are unhappy about the way their world changed, now that they have time to think. “Empires do not suffer emptiness of purpose at the time of their creation. It is when they have become established that aims are lost and replaced by vague ritual.” The Bene Gesserit Reverent mother, Scytale, a face Dancer Bene Tleilax, a guild navigator and empress Irulan meet to plot against Paul. They sent him a gift, a Ghola, a sort of clone made of Duncan Idaho’s dead flesh. They somehow program it to kill Atreides when activated. Paul is unable to refuse to have his childhood friend beside him, even though the ghola retains no memory of his past life. At the same time both Empress Irulan, Chani, the consort are desperate to sire a hire to the throne. Irulan feeds Birth control to Chani in secret while Muad’dib refuses to touch his wife. I confess that I’ve read the plot before starting. I wanted to know what I was getting into, my own power of prescience. Already knowing the plot, it allowed me to concentrate on the writing. I was able to enjoy the philosophic dialogues that I also appreciated in the original Dune, but also to see the problems. By far, the biggest issue I have with this book is how the author wrote women and all the nauseous sexual innuendoes concerning Alia. I will elaborate for each character because it pissed me off. I was surprised by these choices since Dune had some powerful women. •\tIrulan: She was present only at the beginning to moan that she wasn’t getting it from Paul and that she wanted a child so badly. So much so that she decided to conspire with the enemy. •\tChani: Poor woman is only a cardboard character here, a submissive thing and only a vessel for Muad’Dib’s heir. I remember that she had some sort of personality in the novel so I was very disappointed. •\tJessica: The powerful Jessica decided she has done enough and retired on Caladan, letting her offspring to ruin the world without her. She only sent a pointless letter This is so unlike Jessica to stay behind and not try to scheme. •\tThe Reverend Mother had some interesting interventions until she suggested that Paul and his sister should mate to produce a suitable heir from a genetic point of view. Later, she is brought back for a diatribe against IVF. It really reminded me that this book was written in the 60’. Or it could have ben set in Alabama. •\tAlia. Ok, I will try to write this without puking. In this book Alia is 15, going on 16 and apparently on heat. At some point, the author makes her fight naked and when Paul sees her, he realizes that she became a woman and almost gets a hard-on. Grose. And then there is talk about finding her a mate, later she feels a “post-coital sadness” and so on. Oh, and Duncan kisses her. I understand that she has the memories Jessica and all the Reverend Mothers before her but still, she looks like a 15 year old girl. WTF Herbert? The parts involving Paul, his internal struggles, the dialogues with his friends and enemies were all good, some excellent. They touched me and I felt sorry for him. I wanted to absorb some parts of this book inside me. However, I could not understand some of the author’s decisions. Well, as Paul said “There are problems in this universe for which there are no answers,” Paul said. “Nothing. Nothing can be done.” Some more quotes: The flesh surrenders itself, he thought. Eternity takes back its own. Our bodies stirred these waters briefly, danced with a certain intoxication before the love of life and self, dealt with a few strange ideas, then submitted to the instruments of Time. What can we say of this? I occurred. I am not … yet, I occurred. “We must not grieve for those dear to us before their passing.” “Before their passing,” Paul whispered. “Tell me, little sister, what is before?” All it required was water … and love. Life changed those irascible wastes into shapes of grace and movement, he thought. That was the message of the desert. Contrast stunned him with realization. He wanted to turn to the aides massed in the sietch entrance, shout at them: If you need something to worship, then worship life—all life, every last crawling bit of it! We’re all in this beauty together!"

Some favorite elements: Sci-Fi pregnancies are always a fertile ground for plot ideas, bad pun intended, and as each mother of any species and epoch wants the best for the unborn and has the healthiest diet possible, there is one question that comes with pregnancy enhancing drugs and magical substances turning embryos in mentalists. Especially when pimping the baby in the womb is totally safe and nothing can go wrong anymore or each complication and problem can immediately be solved thanks to very advanced future medicine, the mother loses the legitimation to refuse any optimization possible, because it would actively harm the child by reducing the chances in the future and in competition with others, something already in discussion regarding genetic engineering nowadays. If it´s magic powder and its quality and quantity that decide over the future career of the child as a doctor, engineer, or god-emperor, it´ a bit trickier to find the right amount, because there are no mini- and nanobots patrolling the body scanning around. You know, I guess even fictional characters´ bodies might have different tolerances and biochemistries so how does a woman decide how much is too much and will the eyes of the kid glow too blue or too less and is a too less even desirable if it includes lower potential? If it´s already shining trough the womb during pregnancy, it might be just the right dosage. The world with shapeshifters, clones, psi powers, breeding programs, and intrigues that are distilled in a much smaller area than in the first novel, intensifying the suspense of so many different fractions competing with another. Philosophical, political, social, ethical, and moral questions in vast amounts, I would like to know how many books and ideas Herbert used to create the philosophy of the world and its protagonists and would be interested in a list of the references and how he modified and changed all the ideas, there is certainly a wiki, Reddit, or blog dealing with this. Diving deeper in this second dimension of the story might only be possible when rereading or regularly stopping while reading to reflect on what has just been said and to try to put it in the context of the whole story. It was so cool and could have been much longer, everything is perfect here and there would have been the potential for double the size with all the suspenseful elements and open questions. And the dialogues, it´s not often the case that there is something to read like that, so go for it.

And then I read Messiah and was pretty much completely dissatisfied. Not enough to give it a poor rating, since it is interesting (I mean, we all still care about Paul, even if he is a whiner) and it did keep my attention. You haven't seen foreshadowing until you've read Dune Messiah . It takes that to a whole new, grotesque level. And pretentiousness. Thought Dune was pretentious? Hah! This one makes Dune look like a chimney-sweep in comparison. It's as though Frank Herbert managed to make a blunt weapon out of pretentiousness and use it directly on the reader's mind. My final impression was of just another massive philosophical acid trip consisting of a bunch of people smarter than me bandying hints and portentous minutiae in the middle of a half-realized desert wonderland for over three hundred pages. And I didn't really care about Duncan Idaho, anyway, since he was only in Dune for like forty pages and he only spoke about twice. Telling me ten times in a row that Paul really really liked Idaho is not going to make me feel the same way about him, Frank Herbert! Now I'm afraid to read number three."

About half the size of the original, it feels like a simply bridge to Children of Dune than an actual sequel to Dune. But the theme of the story is one that Frank Herbert must have believed personally and that is Think For Yourself. People are not gods. Gods are not governance. To deify politicians and world leaders is a can of worms that should never be opened. Fans of the original fell in love with Paul Atreides and to see him essentially as a flawed leader with clay feet left a bitter taste in many mouths. So, again, it's easy to understand the criticism. It's like if Empire Strikes Back came out and Luke turned out to be just some dude who was more lucky than gifted. I’ll always recommend reading Messiah and Children of Dune together. Because as a stand alone, Messiah vanishes under the vast shadow cast by its predecessor."

Unfortunately, I'm one of those readers where if the writing style doesn't suit me, the rest probably won't either. It took me days to finish the three-hundred-pages book, which usually takes me a day or two when I like the story. I think that in itself shows how much I enjoyed it. I must admit that the ending made me want to continue it, but I think I should take a short break from the world of Dune, because sadly for me this is not the type of series that I could binge read in a week. Maybe these are the type of books that I need to savor slowly to understand them better, or just like them more, I honestly don't know, but despite my low rating here, I will probably continue this series one day, when the right time comes."

        "text":"Having re-read Dune (and reviewed it here on GR) recently, I figured I should continue and read at least the initial trilogy with Dune Messiah and Children of Dune to get a better idea of the world that Frank Herbert created. I am glad that I read Dune Messiah. It is an excellent novel about destiny and fate and how much of it we can control. We get more insight into the Navigators - here I noticed that, unlike in Dune, we actually meet a Navigator (one of the three primary conspirators against Paul Maud'dib) which means that David Lynch most have read this book as well before making his cult classic movie of the first book. We also learn more about the Bene Geserits and the Mentats. I found it particularly fascinating that the Butlerian Jihad, which takes place a few hundred years before the action in Dune and Dune Messiah, was actually, if I understood correctly, a war of humans against machines which the humans won. Following this victory, computers were banished from the known universe and instead Mentats and Navigators (inspired by melange made from spice) were bred to be human computers for political and financial strategy in the former case, and for navigation in space-time for the latter. This fascinated me because I have read and watched so much science fiction where the machines win (or are winning) such as in Ghost in the Shell or Neuromancer, or Blade Runner, or Hyperion and Dune is one of the rare universes where humans won and yet, at what cost? Banning machines seems to have brought humans back to a medieval society with its aristocracies (House Corrino, House Harkkonen, House Atreides) and oppression and genetic manipulation (Bene Gesserit). And once the Fremen rally around Paul to destroy two of the three houses and install Paul as the new Emperor and as the Dune Messiah, is this new regime really a new start for humanity or just another autocratic regime. It sure looks like that latter and we get inklings of this as the Fremen go spread the Gospel of their Maud'dib and subsequently spilling not just a little blood. All of these things continue to torture Paul as they did in Dune and yet he is inevitably driven forward by this messianic destiny. Enter the conspiracy of a Bene Gesserit priestess, a rogue Navigator and a strange Face Dancer who want to topple Paul's regime, well more specifically kill his Fremen wife and force him to sleep with his sister Alia (ewww!!) so as to continue the genetic engineering project and re-install the old regime over which each had more control than under Paul. Another piece of the puzzle here is the reappearance of Duncan Idaho, mentor and friend to Paul as a Zensunni master which has unintended consequences. Zensunnism in itself is a fascinating blend of Sunni Islam and Zen Buddhism that also is followed by the Freman. In essence, Herbert created a universe where classic monarchal hegemonies come into conflict with religious fanatics - in a sense we can see the Fremen hordes as marauding Zen Buddhist priests in ancient Japan fighting the Emperor, well that is one image that came into my mind anyway, so as not to wear out the old Western capitalism vs Islamic obscurantism trope. While perhaps less expansive and mind-blowing than the first Dune, Dune Messiah still delivers punches as a great plot with convincing characters and lots of philosophical questions. On to Children of Dune! I have since finished the whole canonical series and enjoyed all of it. [UPDATE] I am looking forward to Denis Villeneuve's Dune in October 2021. The previews I have seen so far seem to be quite coherent with respect to the book. I was a fan of Lynch's Dune and am curious to see what Villeneuve does with this one. Feel free to comment below.

        "text":"I really liked Frank Herbert's classic science fiction novel Dune when I first read it a few months ago --so much so that I named it one of the best books I read that year. But upon finally getting around to the sequel, Dune Messiah I'm pretty disappointed. It's really boring. Don't get me wrong, I can see some of the impressive literary clockwork that Herbert assembles in the book. Where Dune told the story of Paul Muad’Dib's rise to the Emperor, controller of the universe's only source of the coveted super spice \"melange,\" and general badass dude, Messiah tells the story of his downfall. It also follows through on one of the more interesting concepts introduced in the first book: Paul's spice-induced ability to foresee the eventual species-wide extinction of humans and the hard choices he has to make in order to steer history towards a lesser evil. Indeed, Messiah fast forwards to a point where Paul's fanatic followers have propagated a holy war that has destroyed entire planets and left over 60 billion people dead in just a few years. By those measures, Paul is the worst monster history has ever created, yet he has to bear the mostly private burden of knowing that he's killing all those people to save the race as a whole while simultaneously trying to outmaneuver his political opponents and crafty assassins. Angst! The problem I have with Messiah is that it suffers acutely from a kind of talking head syndrome. It's not until the back sixth or so of the book that anything interesting happens. Dune had sword fights, skirmishes, Paul and his mother tromping around the deadly desert of Arakis meeting and learning about the Fremen, and all other kinds of adventures. Messiah devotes literally dozens of pages at a time to sitting in a room listening to conspirators talk to each other. And then talking about what the talking means. And then thinking about what the talking about the talking means. It's terrible and jarring to see how Herbert has switched gears so abruptly from fascinating adventure and world building to stark exposition and naval gazing. Not that some of the ideas aren't interesting. The way that Paul must grapple with his precognition and how he has to grasp at things to try and leave humanity on the path to survival in the wake of his inevitable fall is a complex and fascinating idea, for one. And I liked the idea of how his strengths are the things that ultimately do him in --sometimes literally. It's just that I wish Herbert had found ways to make this story less tedious in its execution. Is the third book any better? I'm on the fence at this point."

        "text":"Buddy read with Athena ! \"Once more the drama begins.\" - The Emperor Paul Muad'dib on his ascension to the Lion Throne Twelve years have passed since the Battle of Arrakeen, where Paul Atreides wrestled the Imperium from the hands of the Padishah Emperor, and seized the Lion Throne for himself. Dune has become the political and economical centre of the universe, and the Qizarate priesthood has spread Muad'dib's name throughout space and turned him into not only an emperor with absolute power, but a god in his own right. Yet there are those who would topple the god emperor from his religious throne. In the grand circles of power, a new conspiracy arises from the shadows. Its goals and ambitions are many, and it seeks to infiltrate the ranks of the Atreides and the Fremen, striking at those closest to the emperor in order to remove him from power. And each step brings its plans closer to succeeding. \"Mysterious, lethal, an oracle without eyes, Catspaw of prophecy, whose voice never dies!\" Dune Messiah is, in many ways, even better than Dune . It cannot stand up to the wonder of discovering the world of Arrakis for the first time, but it certainly has other strengths. The setting and the writing style is mostly the same as in the first book. The story though, has changed dramatically. The first book is about Paul Atreides and his quest for vengeance against those who betrayed his family and seized their land. The second book is about managing an empire and protecting it from a devilishly dangerous conspiracy who shuns no means to achieve what they want. There is more political maneuvering, more hidden agendas, and more excitement for the reader. The character have also grown more interesting in the second book. Paul, Chani and Irulan are all older and more experienced in the games of power, and were much more enjoyable to read about than they were in the first one. And perhaps the most fascinating character of them all is Alia, Paul's sister. Still only fifteen years of age, she is both a Reverend Mother of the Bene Gesserit, a leader of the Qizarate priesthood, and a powerful voice in the Imperial Council. What truly made me decide to let this book keep the five stars from the first time I read it, was the ending. I will not go into details about it, but only say that this may be the most beautiful ending I have ever read in a sci-fi or fantasy book ever. For those of you who have read Dune and are debating with yourselves whether or not to read its sequels, I hope this review will be helpful in deciding. For those of you who haven't read any of the books from this universe, know that it is in my eyes one of the greatest fictional series of all time. I would definitely recommend it to every single one of you, because it's a wonderful story with few equals in the world of science fiction. Such a rich store of myths enfolds Paul Muad'dib, the Mentat Emperor, and his sister, Alia, it is difficult to see the real persons behind these veils. But there were, after all, a man born Paul Atreides and a woman born Alia. Their flesh was subject to space and time. And even though their oracular powers placed them beyond the usual limits of time and space, they came from human stock. They experienced real events which left real traces upon a real universe. To understand them, it must be seen that their catastrophe was the catastrophe of all mankind. This work is dedicated, then, not to Muad'dib or his sister, but to their heirs - to all of us. - Dedication in the Muad'dib Concordance as copied from The Tabla Memorium of the Mahdi Spirit Cult"

        "text":"When I first read Dune Messiah , it was nearly twenty years ago and like a lot things time had erased most of the details from my brain - including the ending. So digging into it last week was a treat; felt like something new. From re-discovering characters and themes, to gaining an understanding that my seventeen-year-old brain wasn't able to yet comprehend. As a note on my assessment style: Part of me wants to respond to other reviewers here on Goodreads concerning their literary criticisms. However, I’ve found that to be a self-defeating endeavor. I come from the school of: A review should stand on its own merits. But I have a little cheat here - I can respond to what my younger self thought of Dune Messiah . The Nick West of twenty years ago did have some criticisms of this book that may have been rooted in misunderstanding — and at the very least, a sense of disappointment or superb literary let-down. As I respond to Nick of the 90s, you can parallel similar themes in other 2 and 3 star reviews on this site. So here we are: You the reader, Nicholas at age 37, and Nick at age 17. Let’s chat. **(There is one specific thing I do want to address concerning other reviews, because it’s a weirdly specific critique that pops up a bunch of times. But we’ll get there in a minute.)** Off the top here, I loved this book. I had it on my Goodreads for 10 days, but really I ate up the bulk of the text in a three day page-burner. Here’s something that Nick, age 17, could not fully realize about Dune Messiah : This is a novel for grown ups. Gone is the fairy-tale magic of a young man forced into extraordinary circumstances. Gone are any aspects to the beginnings of the hero’s journey. Instead, we get the biggest realization that Nicholas at age 37 has had about the Dune series: Those aspects of fantasy and science fiction tropes that got me into the story, seemingly became absent concepts in Book Two. While not incidental , those surface elements are incidentally the thing that I got hung up on the first time I read this series. And they weren’t even the most important things in the saga. Frank Herbert has this reputation for making Dune some impenetrable document as rigid, complicated, and vengeful as the Old Testament. But that’s a bad rap. On the surface, the first Dune book was a seemingly simple story of betrayal and revenge. The world building, interpersonal relationships, religious philosophies, and political intrigue are as deep as anything ever put into fiction. (The vengeful part is, however, accurate.) So, when teenage Nick finished Dune ; what felt like the most epic journey my imagination had ever been on, only to crack open the next book and feel like I was thrust into the pages of a bad pulp novel, it felt a bit confusing. I read the prologue which contained on-the-nose dialogues by some nameless jailer and a historian. Okay? — The empire of Paul Maud’dib has a Spanish Inquisition team? The next chapter introduced me to Face Dancers, gaseous fish-men, and a conspiracy to kick the book into gear — It is a little pulpy. But the Harkonnens are pretty damn pulpy too. As adversaries they are supervillain-gaga. Maybe you just missed it missed it because of how epic the story was around them. Geez, young Nick, you didn’t realize it was pulp all along. With a healthy dose of psychedelia and the best world building since Tolkien. As to the confusion of the prologue, turns out that’s just a clever way to deliver exposition on what became of the Universe since Paul ascended to emperorship: It’s been twelve years since the first book, etc… Pulp might be the wrong word. But the heart of the matter is that Herbert had a vision (visions!) in which he used Dune , Book One, to dip a toe in, or maybe a foot. But with Dune Messiah , we definitely went waist deep. What’s third base in a swimming mixed metaphor? I think Frank Herbert reached his hand down my pants from a psychedelic standpoint. But I’m skipping ahead. Nick at 17 was let down. My expectations had been subverted. Dune Messiah isn’t about the Shakespearean characters performing hyper-slick action scenes. No. Book Two in the series is much more contemplative. We jump into new dramas between old characters and fresh faces. And yes, teenage Nick, there is a hell of a lot of talking. But to call that boring or hard to follow betrays an unrefined mind, kid. This novel is a procedural of emotion, passion, pleasure, the struggle with mortality — you know, the human condition — Not only did Frank Herbert up his literary game; he did so with a brevity and beauty that was perfect for this story. And what we think of as a slow burn actually has new twists and intrigues on practically every other page. If you pay attention, which the writing makes easy to do, the payoff is a powerful one indeed. On that note: Paul Maud’dib is dealing with some heavy stuff as Emperor of the known Universe. He had allowed (Or he claimed it as out of his control) a horrible Jihad to rage across the universe. This Holy War is what I struggled with the most both times I read the novel — and perhaps Herbert was using this as a way to expand the reader’s consciousness? (This is a meta theory if you tie it into the Ghola\/Hayt\/Duncan Idaho’s fate. Whoa. There’s a thesis, man���) You really have to open up new channels of thought to figure out why Paul could not stop evil from being done in the Atreides name. Was there really was no order of events or commands that could’ve stopped the Fremen conquerers? There was a series of events that could control the Jihad! It just took Paul twelve years to make it work! So now we get into the goods. Here’s what makes this book such a killer, twelve-round-fight-with-a-knockout-punch, genius piece of literature. Paul faces several huge problems that seem insurmountable. And he feels trapped by his prescience. If one could see the future and decided on a certain path, the sheer boredom would be brutal. But there is still too much fear for the boredom to kick in. There is a complicated conspiracy against him that is so powerful, even his knowledge of the plot cannot stop its machinations. Paul must produce an heir. If this is done improperly, the love of his life would be tortured and turned into a slave. the Jihad must be stopped. The unbalanced government fueled by religious zealots needs to be set on a more progressive track. That’s quite a tall order for 329 pages. On top of that, we are told in the prologue about Paul’s downfall. So now we’re faced with a whodunnit?, or more of a howdunnit? Will the conspirators win the day? Can Paul cement a legacy that reaches beyond violence? Can Chani bear a child that lives? So we sit through all the meetings, and conversations that take place jumping between multiple points-of-view. We delve into character’s deepest thoughts, passions, desires, and inadequacies — something that Herbert can actually pull off. What could have been a mess of massive internal dialogues, instead becomes a string, a chord, and finally a cable pulling the reader forward page by page. Yes, young Nick. How could you understand the anxiety a father feels for his children? Or a husband for his wife of more than a decade? You really can’t. Frank Herbert wrote a book for grown ups. And when you’re all grown up, you might catch a bit of what was trying to be conveyed. All the while being heaped with a massive dose of trippy visions pulling you into the undertow of genetic and higher-thinking philosophies. Before we realize what he’s done, Herbert has crafted the perfect ending to Paul’s journey. It is melancholy and poetic. And after chapters of Paul’s nihilistic despair and frenetic energy, he is given peace. You try writing something half as spectacular. So, teenage Nick, give it some time, buddy. Dune Messiah comes highly recommended from you, a man who has changed a little bit over the last twenty years. — **Finally here’s that weird note that pops up in a bunch of Goodreads reviews. I’ll go ahead and quote some actual reviews here (Of course, I’m not going to call out individual names. I’m not here to pick a fight. These reviewers have just as much validity in their feelings towards the book as I do.) Bolds added by me.— “I'm realizing there's not much to this book. It simply bridges the first and third.” “After re-reading Dune recently, I decided to finally get around to reading Dune Messiah - the sequel to Dune and the bridge to Children of Dune.” “I read in reviews all over the Internet that it was boring that it was basically only a bridge between DUNE and CHILDREN OF DUNE.” “For me Dune Messiah acts as a slightly dull (but not too shabby) bridge to go on to the original trilogy’s grand finale Children of Dune\" (This next one says the same thing but surprisingly doesn’t use the key word, BRIDGE . Seriously, what is going on here?) “The feel of the book is like a prelude to what comes next, that the third book will be the true sequel to Dune.” “This is not to say I didn't love the book -- far from it! It definitely feels like a bridging book between \"Dune\" and \"Children of Dune”” You get the point. At least 30 different reviews used this terminology in my quick scan. Firstly: What the hell is going on? Did everyone read each other’s reviews and just spew the same points using their own re-ordered sentences? Is there some secret Dune -whisperer-critic that said this is a “bridge” novel and that became reality for everyone else? Seriously, wtf? Secondly: I think most of these folks are wrong. You could stop the series at Dune Messiah and have a really satisfying ending to Paul’s journey. Honestly, Messiah is one of the best damn endings I’ve ever read. It’s a magic trick where the cards are face up the whole time and you’re still left wondering how Frank Herbert pulled it off. Good stuff, Mr. Herbert. Young Nick, ignore these “ bridge ” acolytes. I don’t trust ‘em. :P"

        "text":"Hace mucho tiempo que tenía ganas de leer la secuela de Dune y ahora que por fin lo he hecho me ha dejado sentimientos encontrados. Es un relato que arranca 12 años después del final de la primera parte y va a mostrarnos en qué ha ido a parar el imperio galáctico a manos de su nuevo emperador. Es un libro mucho más lento, reflexivo y filosófico que el anterior... esto por norma general suele gustarme, pero en esta ocasión hubo muchas partes que me resultaron confusas y hasta la mitad de la novela (que además es bastante breve) no conseguí interesarme verdaderamente por lo que estaba ocurriendo. Por otro lado el desenlace me encantó y me ha dejado con muchísimas ganas de leer la siguiente parte con la próxima generación. Creo que todos los que amaron la primera parte conseguirán disfrutar de esta en mayor o menor medida, tiene más intrigas políticas, más corrupción espacial, más worldbuilding fascinante y lo más importante de todo... más bene gesserit. *******Alia gracias por existir *******Jessica vuelve"

        "text":"Sometimes one book is enough. Sometimes less is more. Sometimes a story needs to be left alone. I have never been more disappointed with a sequel in my entire life. It’s that bad I wish I never read it and I also wish that the author never wrote it because it adds absolutely nothing to the franchise. I’m so surprised at how poor it is. I’ve heard that the series gets worse with each book, and I can’t imagine how it could get any worse than this. So, I’m going to stop right here and save myself writing anymore negative reviews and wasting my time with bad writing. The main problem is that nothing really happens. The plot is non-existent, which is surprising considering just how intricate the first book is. The world is huge, and Herbert could have done so much with it. Instead, he extended the story further than it should have been and the consequences are dire. The only point of interest, a resurrected character from the first book, fails to deliver the drama and tension he appears to bring with his presence. Ultimately, because the first book is just so fantastic, the sequels will only ever be compared to it. It’s how these things work. A series needs to be consistent in its imaginative power and it needs to be consistent in its drive and quality. This is so weak compared to the first book that I could only ever be disappointed. Whilst there are some interesting aspects, they suffer because the plot stays so stationery and frets over the ethics of religious jihad and Paul’s impassivity in the face of his destiny. I also found the mention of real-world historical figures a little odd considering there was no mention of anything like this in the first novel. There is a comparison between Paul and Hitler, as Herbert considers who has killed more people during the act of conquest. And this threw me totally off because the series seemed very self-contained. It’s like Richard III being mentioned in a Star Wars novel when the universe wasn’t built on ours initially. This totally destroyed any sense of immersion in the plot. Herbert should have just stuck to one book or, better yet, actually wrote a decent sequel or something new. ___________________________________ You can connect with me on social media via My Linktree . __________________________________"

        "text":"Oh, man, where the fuck do I really even start? When I've read Dune last year I fell head over heels in love with it. It had been such a long time since I've read a chunky sci-fi\/fantasy novel and I seriously didn't expect to love that book, its characters, the world building, and its plot as much as I did. Empires do not suffer emptiness of purpose at the time of their creation. It is when they have become established that aims are lost and replaced by vague ritual. And even though Dune had a somewhat closed ending, I was still curious to see where Paul Muad'Dib would end up. What would happen to Arrakis under his rule? To the Fremen? To the whole universe? I've heard many interesting takes on the series as a whole, and I am mainly interested in the philosophical questions of power, worship and human control over nature that it raises. Therefore, I knew that I had to give Dune Messiah a shot, to piece the puzzle together, and to get more answers. I didn't nearly love it as much as I loved Dune . Dune had the big advantage of everything being new. I was introduced to Arrakis, to the Atreides, the Harkonnens; I saw the ornithopters, the Fremen stillsuits and the sandworms for the first time; I started to grasp the complexity of this world that Frank Herbert created. Whereas in Dune Messiah , albeit the world has changed, it still feels oddly familiar. To me, the sequel didn't feel as fresh or new or even original. It felt more like the traditional sci-fi novels that I usually stay clear off. In Dune , Paul was a young boy who led a revolution against the tyranny of the Padishah empire. However, when he ascended the throne as emperor, a jihad got unleashed in his name, leading to the death of 61 billion people. He became a failed hero. Heroes who fail to recognise their humanity fall into an abyss of desolation forged from the failures they encounter once realism dawns on them. There exists no separation between gods and men; one blends softly casual into the other. Dune Messiah shows how deadly religion can get once it has a cause that fuels it. Paul knows that even if he were to disappear or die, he wouldn't be able to stop the jihad, he'd simply become a martyr, a God, fuelling the jihad even more. The people fighting in his name have become fanatics, succumbed to a cause that will never let them out of its grips. There are problems in this universe for which there are no answers. Nothing. Nothing can be done. In Dune Messiah , we find many interesting musings on power and freedom: \"Power tends to isolate those who hold too much of it. Eventually, they lose touch with reality … and fall.\", \"Any delusions of Free Will he harboured now must be merely the prisoner rattling his cage. His curse lay in the fact that he saw the cage.\", and \"Too much freedom breeds chaos.\" I wish I had found the time (or energy) to contemplate these a lot more, because I really like how Herbert subverts the (white) savior trope in this series. Paul is a failed hero. And for that, he is the most interesting character in these books. We see the paradoxes surrounding him. So, I really like what Herbert has to say about the nature of power, and how it corrupts (not just the person who holds it but also the cause for which it is used), however, I have to admit that I haven't (yet) dived deep into an interpretation of the series. I think I will save that for when I've finished Children of Dune . I can't wait to read all the hot takes and watch video essays on it. Now let's discuss some of the things I really didn't enjoy this book – and why it ultimately left me a little bit disappointed. Similarly to Dune , Frank Herbert's writing style is just really not my cup of tea. I don't think that his writing is beautiful nor effective. Whilst I love his world building and appreciate the complexity of the universe he created, I have to admit that I struggle with visualising any of his descriptions. Therefore, I was very happy that I could bounce off the visuals of Denis Villeneuve's new film. They really helped me picture the world whilst reading. However, as new characters and elements of the world are introduced in Dune Messiah , I struggled with visualising them. It's not that Herbert doesn't describe them, it's just how he does it that doesn't work for me. I always end up picturing the most ridiculous things possible. For example, if you compare Herbert's descriptions of the members of the Spacing Guild – \"Edric swam in a container of orange gas … The Guildsman was an elongated figure, vaguely humanoid with finned feet and hugely fanned membraneous hands – a fish in a strange sea. His tank’s vents emitted a pale orange cloud rich with the smell of the geriatric spice, melange.\" – to Denis Villeneuve's cool design for the movie: It's not hard to pick a favorite. Herbert's description seems so ... weird? A fish-like figure swimming in an orange gas tank? What is that supposed to look like? How is that practical for the story? How does Edric move forward? Isn't he super vulnerable because people could just break his tank?? What is happening? Whereas in the movie, the Spacing Guild looks fucking epic, even intimidating. They have a much more Star Wars -y design. And I can take them seriously. In the movie, they are much more believable. Another example is the Dune Tarot. Up to this day, I don't understand what its function is or how it even works. It's an oracular tool (basically Tarot cards?) sold in markets on Arrakis. For some reason, that is never properly explained, the existence of the Tarot muddles Paul's and Alia's ability to see the future. Wait, what? How? And why? Because there are more prophets. It makes no sense. Also, just picturing Fremen dealing with Tarot cards is too fucking funny to me. Again, it's a part of the world that would've probably been really cool and epic in the films, but in the book, I fail to take it seriously. My biggest gripe with Dune Messiah , however, is what Frank Herbert did to the character of Alia. She had such great potential in Dune , being the youngest and most powerful Reverend Mother, I couldn't wait to see her as a teenager (she is 15 at the beginning of Dune Messiah ), so that she could become more integral to the plot. Instead of fleshing out her character and giving her an important role (which would suit her powers), Herbert does nothing but sexualise her throughout the entirety of the novel. It was frustrating, and even disgusting at times, but let me elaborate: It all started going to shit right off the bat, when the Tleilaxu admit that their plan is to distract her by making her fall in love with Hayt: \"She is of an age when she can be distracted by a charming male designed for that purpose. She will be attracted by his maleness and by his abilities as a mentat.\" So, you're telling me, one of the most powerful creatures of this universe will get distracted and lured into a trap by a man? Umm, okay, sure. Keep on dreaming, Herbert. I really don't understand why Herbert was so obsessed with stressing the point that now, at age 15, Alia has her sexual awakening: \"It was lust in tension with chastity, she thought. Her flesh desired a mate. Sex held no casual mystery for a Reverend mother who had presided at the sketch orgies.\" I mean, what is happening??? Why is that necessary?? Paul didn't go through a sex-crazy phase when he was a teenager in Dune , so why must Alia? The lowest of low points was the scene in which Alia decides to do target practice naked: \"Abruptly, Alia climbed dripping from the bath, strode wet an naked into the training chamber which adjoined her bedroom.\" The whole scene was so muddled by the male gaze it was hard to bear. Women do not enjoy fighting naked. It's not practical, Herbert. Titties bouncing all over the place. It hurts. And the way Herbert described this naked 15-year old (!!!) girl – \"Sweat glistened on her naked skin.\" – made me very uncomfortable. It was disgusting. When Alia is discovered by her brother Paul and Stilgar, Frank Herbert once again showed that he's a man and doesn't understand teenage girls: \"Alia, growing conscious of her nudity, thought to cover herself, found the idea amusing. What the eyes had seen could not be erased.\" Absolutely not. Girls don't find it amusing when their brothers see them naked?? What is going on with you?? In general, Herbert tried to establish somewhat of a sexual tension between Alia and Paul (...who is 30 at this point, mind you – AND HER FUCKING BROTHER) – \"Paul took his time reading the reactions on her face and body: the flush of her exertions colouring her skin, the wet fulness of her lips. There was a disquieting femaleness about her that he had never considered in his sister.\" – and I wasn't here for any of that. It was soooo unnecessary to the plot, and just disgusting. When Paul noticed that \"Yes – there’d been a ruttish air about Alia.\" I actually wanted to throw my copy of the book away. I mean, what the fuck is going on here, Frank? Can we focus, please? Another way that Alia was thrown under the bus in this novel is her relationship to Hayt\/Duncan. Alia, the most powerful and most KNOWLEDGEABLE creature in the universe (having absorbed all the knowledge of all Reverend Mothers before her), becomes a naive and silly girl in front of Hayt and his \"male confidence\" (her words, not mine...). At the end of the book, she literally says to him: \"'I need you, Duncan,' she sobbed. 'Love me.'\" Are you fucking kidding me? How about you start using your powers and choosing your own destiny, instead of relying on this man (who kissed you without your consent btw)??? So yeah, Alia's character went DOWN THE DRAIN, and I'm still pissed about it. Anyways, what follows now is a very short summary of Dune Messiah – which I will use for further reference once I get to Children of Dune (ya'll know that my memory is like a sieve) – so please beware of spoilers: Twelve years after Paul Atreides's ascension as emperor, the death toll of the jihad unleashed in his name peeks 61 billion people. Paul gains total control of Melange's production, making him the most powerful emperor to have ever ruled. Using his prescience, Paul tries to create a golden path for humanity. “I’ve killed sixty-one billion, sterilised ninety planets, completely demoralised five hundred others. I’ve wiped out the followers of forty religions which had existed since.” The Bene Gesserit, Spacing Guild, and Tleilaxu come together to plot a plan that will lead to Paul's dethroning. Reverend Mother Gaius recruits Princess Irulan, Paul's consort, to work on the inside, and she does so by adding contraceptives into Chani's food, preventing her from conceiving for Paul. However, Chani gets pregnant after using a Fremen fertility diet. Scytale, the face dancer from the Tleilaxu, brings Paul a gift of Duncan Idaho's ghola, called Hayt. Paul's acceptance of Hayt creates a rift between him and the Fremen. Paul discovers a Fremen plot to kill him and confronts his opposition. Paul gets blinded by a Stone Burner. Paul tries negotiating Chani's life in exchange for artificially inseminating Princess Irulan. As foreseen, Chani dies in childbirth, and Hayt attacks Paul but recovers his former self. Paul kills Scytale by using his son's eyes after having received a prescient vision from the perspective of his newborn son. Paul then loses his own prescience in the act. Paul leaves his new twin babies in Alia's care and walks into the desert as a man as per the Fremen tradition. Alia orders the execution of Paul's enemies, including Reverend Mother Gaius and Edric. However, she spares Princess Irulan."

        "text":"If you ask any first-time reader of ‘Dune’ where he or she thinks the story is likely to go in the follow-up, I doubt if anyone could have predicted ‘Dune Messiah’. It does not work as a book, as there is really no beginning, just a slow (very, very slow and exposition-laden) flat-line of a narrative that gives a slight blip at the overly dramatic ending, which is clearly meant to set-up ‘Children of Dune’ rather than end the second book in any satisfactory fashion. I think ‘Dune Messiah’ is much better-suited as the last part of ‘Dune’ itself, where it would function as a reflective coda deconstructing the consequences of the preceding events. Clearly, ‘Dune Messiah’ did little to deter the juggernaut that the Dune books would ultimately become. It had about as much effect as poor old Paul trying to avert the jihad and prevent humanity going off the rails of civilisation. Paul spends pretty much the entire book in an existential funk, pondering his increasingly opaque and contradictory visions (much to the frustration of the patient reader, who still has no clue as to what it is he is actually ‘seeing’.) In a throwaway line so typical of much of the off-hand nature of ‘Dune Messiah’, as if Herbert was deliberately trying to avoid emulating anything that characterised the previous book (and that had made readers fall in love with it), Paul compares notes with fellow ‘emperors’ Genghis Khan and Hitler: “Statistics: at a conservative estimate, I’ve killed sixty-one billion, sterilized ninety planets, completely demoralized five hundred others. I’ve wiped out the followers of forty religions…” This is well into the book’s last act, and does make the reader raise an eyebrow. Oh, so that’s why Paul is in such a bad mood! Apparently, it is barely 12 years after the ending of ‘Dune’, a rather odd number that I’ve seen bandied about but don’t recall being referenced in the actual text. A vast bureaucracy known as the Qizarate has arisen to administer (and temper) the religious fanaticism that has arisen around Paul. A pilgrimage route known as the ‘hajj’ is well-established by now, with Arrakis as its ultimate destination, ensuring that the Qizarate’s coffers are always overflowing. Jessica, however, wants nothing to do with this: Despite the special reverence held for Caladan as the place of Paul’s birth, the Lady Jessica had emphasized her refusal to make her planet a stop on the hajj. “No doubt my son is an epochal figure of history,” she’d written, “but I cannot see this as an excuse for submitting to a rabble invasion.” The main plot of ‘Dune Messiah’ concerns the machinations of a ‘fellowship’ of disparate stakeholders drawn into an uneasy alliance with the common purpose of unseating Paul from his throne. Herbert is always very precise about his terminology, and I am sure his reference to a ‘company of conspirators’ is a deliberate inversion of how the term ‘fellowship’ is used in ‘Lord of the Rings’, for example, the other contemporary countercultural novel that ‘Dune’ is often compared with. While we have the usual suspects like Mohiam and Irulan, it is the new characters and players introduced into the mix that really elevates ‘Dune Messiah’ into something special. If you thought ‘Dune’ could not get any weirder than the quasi-mystical mumbo jumbo of the original, then ‘Dune Messiah’ quickly makes you realise that Herbert still has quite a number of cards up his sleeve (there is a lovely riff on the Dune Tarot set throughout the book.) Bijaz, described as a dwarf Tleilaxu oracle, is a weird combination of Falstaff from Shakespeare and Chucky from the Child’s Play movies, and would not be out of place in a David Lynch movie. Speaking of Lynch, he obviously nicked Edric the mutated Guild Navigator straight from the pages of ‘Dune Messiah’, turning it into an indelible image in SF cinema. Herbert seems to be a fan of baroque excess, as evinced by the flamboyant and thoroughly despicable Baron in ‘Dune’. In ‘Dune Messiah’, however, he introduces yet another shadowy player that is potentially even more perverse and grotesque, the Bene Tleilax. Just where the hell did they come from? Despite the ancient proscription on using computers that arose from the Butlerian Jihad, the Tleilaxu is clearly the predecessor of LexCorp, always flirting with dangerous technology: The Tleilaxu displayed a disturbing lack of inhibitions in what they created. Unbridled curiosity might guide their actions. They boasted they could make anything from the proper human raw material—devils or saints. They sold killer-mentats. They’d produced a killer medic, overcoming the Suk inhibitions against the taking of human life to do it. Their wares included willing menials, pliant sex toys for any whim, soldiers, generals, philosophers, even an occasional moralist. The best demonstration of the overriding creepiness of the Bene Tleilax, of course, is their presentation of a special gift to Paul, a ghola of Duncan Idaho himself, plucked from the battlefield and reanimated like Frankstein’s monster in an axolotl tank (clearly an inversion of the Fremen death still). Alia of the Knife, whom Herbert often reminds the reader is on the cusp of her womanhood, as if there is a noxious whiff of the Baron still hanging around, is immediately turned on by Hayt, the ghola’s Tleilaxu name. Not subtle at all, Herbert. Alia attempts to work off some steam by sparring with an updated version of the fighting machine that Paul used on Caladan in ‘Dune’ (this one even has flashing lights.) Except she does so in the nude. Yes, sex rears its head in ‘Dune Messiah’ like Shai Hulud popping up out of the sand. (A lot of SFX ingenuity in Lynch’s 1984 ‘Dune’ went into preventing the sandworms looking like questing penises. Lynch was only partially successful, but that could have been deliberate on his part.) Herbert reminds us that orgies were a commonplace occurrence in the Fremen sietch (if you recall, Paul first had sex with Chani in the spice-induced orgy after he kills Jamis in single-handed combat.) We even get a quotation from Chapter 3 of The Steersman’s Guild, entitled ‘THE ORGY AS A TOOL OF STATECRAFT’. And as if the Bene Gesserit weren’t in the reader’s bad books already, here they hatch a desperate plot to attempt to get Paul to fuck his sister. “…[T]hat stubborn fool of an Atreides! How could he deny the jewels of posterity within his loins?” Poor sexually-deprived Irulan wonders idly about Edric the Guild Navigator as a potential fuck buddy, “thinking how odd it would be to mate with such a one.” This, mind you, during the first meeting of the conspirators that opens the book, where her mind should be focusing on the larger issues and not be in the gutter (or Edric’s tank, as it were.) Mohiam fondly calls Lady Jessica a “traitorous bitch”, who in turn is told by Scytale: “You are not a sex object, have never been a sex object, cannot be a sex object.” Ouch. That had to hurt as much as the gom jabbar. Ah, Scytale. Described as a ‘Jadacha hermaphrodite’, he (pronouns weren’t as advanced in 1969 when ‘Dune Messiah’ was published), can assume either sex at will, and is commonly referred to as a Face Dancer. “For the present, I am a man,” he declares. The reader is not convinced, because there is something even oilier about Scytale than that uber-creep the Baron. It is especially uncomfortable because Herbert seems to signpost a latent effeminacy or sexual ambiguity in Scytale as being fundamentally wrong. It is clear that a lot of the convoluted sexual politics of ‘Dune’, wrapped up as it were in Herbert’s own subconscious biases towards misogyny and homophobia, begin to, er, come into play in ‘Dune Messiah’. ‘Dune Messiah’ is the literary equivalent of a ‘spice blow’, which is the result of immense pressure building up within a pre-spice mass deep within the sands of Arrakis. (Of course, this is what killed Liet Kynes when he rather stupidly went to lay on top of one in ‘Dune’.) At only about a third of the length of the original novel, so much is packed into ‘Dune Messiah’ that a spice blow is inevitable. Herbert’s writing is always at its most delicate and evocative when he turns to Arrakis itself, and ‘Dune Messiah’ is no exception. He clearly has a deep and abiding love for the desert world he has created, which is a tabula rasa of the natural world despoiled by humanity and its increasingly dramatic and uncontrollable impact on our own planet. There is a wonderful scene near the end when Chani returns to her sietch to give birth (and precipitate the crisis that launches the next book in the sequence): Windblown sand whipped at her, reddened her cheeks. She glanced over her shoulder at the frightful band of dust across the sky. The desert beneath the storm had taken on a tawny, restless appearance as though dune waves beat on a tempest shore the way Paul had once described a sea. She hesitated, caught by a feeling of the desert’s transience. Measured against eternity, this was no more than a caldron. Dune surf thundered against cliffs. The storm out there had become a universal thing for her—all the animals hiding from it...nothing left of the desert but its own private sounds: blown sand scraping along rock, a wind-surge whistling, the gallop of a boulder tumbled suddenly from its hill—then! somewhere out of sight, a capsized worm thumping its idiot way aright and slithering off to its dry depths. As far as I recall, this is the only worm sighting in the entire book, apart from a side plot involving a bunch of Fremen traitors capturing a small maker to take it off-planet and start the spice cycle on a similar world. Ah, but they don’t know about the sand plankton that is such an integral part of the sandworm lifecycle, which is probably what George Lucas had in mind when he started tinkering with the role of midichlorians as an essential component of the Star Wars universe. Herbert continues: Sietch odors assaulted her nostrils. The place was a ferment of nasal memories—the warren closeness of bodies, rank esters of the reclamation stills, familiar food aromas, the flinty burning of machines at work...and through it all, the omnipresent spice: melange everywhere. She took a deep breath. “Home.” Extraordinary. And it is exactly as if the reader him- or herself has returned home, to the deep desert of Arrakis where it all began. Chani’s viewpoint is reflected in Paul’s own perspective: Ugly, barren land! He imagined it sun-soaked and monstrous with heat, a place of sandslides and the drowned darkness of dust pools, blowdevils unreeling tiny dunes across the rocks, their narrow bellies full of ochre crystals. But it was a rich land, too: big, exploding out of narrow places with vistas of storm-trodden emptiness, rampart cliffs and tumbledown ridges. All it required was water...and love. Life changed those irascible wastes into shapes of grace and movement, he thought. That was the message of the desert. Contrast stunned him with realization. He wanted to turn to the aides massed in the sietch entrance, shout at them: If you need something to worship, then worship life—all life, every last crawling bit of it! We’re all in this beauty together! Yes, I know that this is Herbert at his most ‘hippy dippy’ – and it is certainly no surprise that a novel as batshit crazy as this would have such a deeply Age of Aquarius moment in it. But, for me, this is still one of the most remarkable, and memorable, passages in the entire saga. It is the ‘Circle of Life’, writ boldly on the ever-shifting sands of Dune."

        "text":"Segunda entrega de la extraordinaria saga de Frank Herbert, Las crónicas de Dune, considerada una de las más importantes sagas de CF de todos los tiempos. Una joya memorable y atemporal que será siempre el desierto de Arrakis. El mesías de Dune continúa la historia de Paul Atreides, mejor conocido – y temido -, bajo el nombre de Muad’Dib. Como emperador del universo conocido, posee más poder del que jamás debió ejercerun solo hombre. Venerado como ídolo religioso por los vehementes Fremen, Paul se enfrenta a la hostilidad de las castas políticas que desplazó cuando asumió el trono, así como una conspiración dentro de su propio círculo de seguidores. Aunque la Casa Atreides ya comienza a desmoronarse a su alrededor por las intrigas de sus enemigos, la verdadera amenaza para Paul vendrá de su concubina, Chani, y de su hijo nonato, heredero de la dinastía familiar. El mesías de Dune tiene un tono y un estilo completamente diferente al de Dune. Dune estaba lleno de aventura e incluso una arenosa esperanza, todo un grupo trabajando, dispuesto a morir para transformar y cambiar el entorno. Además, Dune tenía un montón de personajes muy fuertes. Por el contrario, el mesías es más político y emocional. El tono en este ha sido más oscuro que el de Dune y no tan inspirador y filosófico. El final del mesías fue un poquito decepcionante, todo lo contrario del final de Dune. O yo tengo el primero en un pedestal y todas las comparaciones son odiosas. Miedo me da el tercero que he leído que para muchos fue algo innecesario. No es tan épico, es casi como un western con muchas intrigas políticas y con referencias a ciertos acontecimientos, pero muy poca acción por no decir inexistente. La sensación del libro es como un preludio de lo que viene después, el tercer libro para mi será la verdadera secuela de Dune. Para los fans de Dune, sin duda, y realmente necesitáis haber leído Dune para conocer a los personajes y tener una idea sobre la compleja e intrincadamente detallada construcción del mundo de Herbert. No deja de ser una genial lectura de lo más entretenida ya que volver a Dune es siempre una idea cojonuda..✍️🎩"

        "text":"Returning to the original world of Dune has a special place in my heart. I seem to recall that Messiah was written before Dune but obviously Dune was published before it. Of course, a beginning is the time for taking the most delicate care that the balances are correct. This every fan of Frank Herbert knows. To begin your study of the life of Dune, then, take care that you first place this in its proper time. Know then that it is the year 2021 and all the covidiots and Q factions have taken over the universe. What was once an act of glorious revenge against a teetering empire has now become an entrenched tragedy. Reading Dune Messiah is the tragedy that we deserve. Taken over by religious zealots, icons over careful deliberation, countless dead instead of a stable empire. But that's where the comparison fails. Paul, unlike any of us, has a much clearer idea of the future, being able to see it, however imperfectly, and he is caught in a web of intrigue and guile and that beautiful sliver of hope hidden in the future that only his eyes see, where only perfidy, assassination, and betrayal seems to be his new bed. Twelve years after the end of Dune, Alia is a teenager and a bright star. Irulan wants an heir to the Empire, Chani is a devoted but flattened character, as is Paul, as all futures grind down to singular points. The time of crisis comes and tragedy, depression, and horror awaits. But at least there is a copy of Duncan Idaho. Now a mentat, a tool of assassination -- and a human computer -- his role captures Paul as hardly anything else could have. Honestly, for years, I thought this one was the worst of the Dune books. But mostly that's because I cared too strongly for Paul, never wanted to see him fall. In actuality, the book is delightfully intellectual and complex, showing us so much more about the Fremen and the pitfalls of a religion-based monarchy and the hellish pitfalls of prescience. Being a god is not all it's cracked up to be. And in a moment or two, Paul's son is going to ask his papa to hold his beer."

        "text":"Secondo romanzo del ciclo di Dune. Sono trascorsi dodici anni da quando i Fremen hanno dato seguito alla loro profezia ed hanno massacrato mondi interi. Il nome di Muad'dib è tuttora, nella galassia, sinonimo di morte. Il tema centrale del romanzo è il pericolo di idolatrare un leader carismatico. Paul non è più il giovane duca in ascesa, ma un imperatore tormentato. La sua jihad, scatenata nel primo libro, ha provocato la morte di miliardi di persone, e lui è prigioniero del suo stesso potere e della sua profezia. Si esplora la linea estremamente sottile tra un salvatore e un tiranno, tema ripreso abbondantemente nel quarto romanzo. Paul è diventato un simbolo incontrollabile, e la sua stessa esistenza è la causa di una violenza che non può fermare. A differenza del primo Dune, che era pieno di battaglie e avventura su larga scala, Messia di Dune ha un ritmo più lento e introspettivo e si concentra sull'intrigo politico e sulla psicologia dei personaggi. Il romanzo mostra le lotte interiori di Paul, la sua prescienza che è sia una benedizione che una maledizione, e il suo disperato tentativo di sfuggire a un destino che ha previsto ma non riesce a evitare. Herbert critica la fede cieca e l'esaltazione religiosa, un avvertimento contro la creazione di figure divine e l'abbandono del libero arbitrio a favore di una religione o di un leader. La prescienza di Paul lo mette di fronte a un paradosso: vedere il futuro significa anche esserne schiavo. La ricerca e la lotta per trovare un \"Sentiero Dorato\" che salvi l'umanità dall'estinzione, anche a un costo personale altissimo. Vengono introdotti personaggi chiave come il ghola di Duncan Idaho, Hayt, che aggiunge un ulteriore livello di introspezione sulla natura dell'identità e della manipolazione. La principessa Irulan, che nel primo libro era una figura quasi marginale, qui assume un ruolo più attivo. Il rapporto tra Paul e Chani, messi alla prova dagli intrighi di palazzo e dalla prescienza di Paul, diventa il cuore emotivo del romanzo. Messia di Dune è un romanzo più filosofico e meno spettacolare del suo predecessore, ma è un tassello essenziale per comprendere la visione completa di Herbert. Mostra le conseguenze del trionfo e distrugge l'idea del salvatore per mostrare la fragilità e il peso del potere assoluto. Qualcuno ha il coraggio di definirla letteratura di evasione...ahhahahah ----------------------------- The second novel in the Dune series. Twelve years have passed since the Fremen fulfilled their prophecy and massacred entire worlds. The name Muad'dib is still synonymous with death throughout the galaxy. The central theme of the novel is the danger of idolizing a charismatic leader. Paul is no longer the rising young duke, but a tormented emperor. His jihad, unleashed in the first book, has resulted in the deaths of billions, and he is a prisoner of his own power and his prophecy. The novel explores the extremely fine line between savior and tyrant, a theme revisited extensively in the fourth novel. Paul has become an uncontrollable symbol, and his very existence is the cause of a violence he cannot stop. Unlike the first Dune, which was filled with battles and large-scale adventure, Dune Messiah has a slower, more introspective pace and focuses on political intrigue and the characters' psychology. The novel reveals Paul's internal struggles, his prescience, which is both a blessing and a curse, and his desperate attempt to escape a fate he foresaw but cannot avoid. Herbert criticizes blind faith and religious exaltation, a warning against the creation of divine figures and the abandonment of free will in favor of a religion or leader. Paul's prescience presents him with a paradox: to see the future also means being its slave. The search and struggle to find a \"Golden Path\" that can save humanity from extinction, even at great personal cost. Key characters are introduced, such as the Duncan Idaho ghola, Hayt, who adds a further layer of insight into the nature of identity and manipulation. Princess Irulan, who was almost a peripheral figure in the first book, takes on a more active role here. The relationship between Paul and Chani, tested by palace intrigue and Paul's prescience, becomes the emotional heart of the novel. Dune Messiah is a more philosophical and less spectacular novel than its predecessor, but it is an essential piece to understanding Herbert's complete vision. It shows the consequences of triumph and destroys the idea of ​​a savior to demonstrate the fragility and weight of absolute power. Someone has the courage to define it as escapist literature...hahahaha"

        "text":"Dune Messiah By Frank Herbert A Dune Retrospective by Eric Allen Four years after the publication of Dune, those who cried out for a sequel were finally answered. Frank Herbert returned to Arrakis for a book that was very different from the action packed first volume of the series, but at the same time, still held a lot of the familiar. When I tell people that I actually enjoyed the sequel to Dune more than the original, the answer I get from the overwhelming majority is, \"Wait . . . Dune has a sequel?\" People know of Dune nowadays through the 1984 cult classic movie. Some people may be vaguely aware that the movie was based on a book, but never bothered to pick it up or look for sequels. Which is a shame, because they're missing out on this little gem of a book. Twelve years after taking the throne of the empire for himself in Dune, Paul \"Muad'Dib\" Atreides has become something of a God, or Savior figure to the Fremen, who have taken up arms and spread out throughout the entire known universe bringing a Holy War to subjugate all beneath his rule. All of this, very much against Paul's own wishes. He has become a figurehead, standing atop the empire as Emperor, while priests of the religion that worships him rule in his name. He has made good his promise to begin turning Dune into a paradise, and now the desert runs freely with water. Another sign to his followers of his godhood. Princess Irulan, Paul's trophy wife, and the means by which he secured the throne is anxious to follow her Bene Gesserit orders to bear the royal heir, but Paul has no love for her and refuses it to her, instead remaining true to his real, Fremen wife Chani. This leads Irulan to join a conspiracy against the Emperor, meant to discredit him, destroy his reputation, and take the wind out of the Fremen Zealots' sails. Out of spite, she has been feeding Chani contraceptives to prevent her from ever bearing Paul an heir, but this plan failed, and Chani conceived anyway. It is discovered that Fremen are part of the conspiracy against Paul, and while meeting with a man to get the names, Paul is blinded in an attempt on his life. Through the powers of his oracular sight, he can still see, though his body is blind. Long story short, after Chani dies in childbirth, Paul wanders into the desert alone, blind and broken, never to be seen again, and leaving the Empire in the hands of his sister Alia until his children are old enough to assume rule. The Good? Again, Frank Herbert did a ridiculous amount of research before writing this book. It shows in how he truly understands the mechanics of economics, politics, and religion. The religion that he has built up around Paul is intriguing, and realistic, and the atrocities that its zealots commit in his name feel logical, and realistic as well. Paul's suffering under the burden of the sins of those who follow him is really well done. This book is more a character study on him, than really anything else, showing the impact his actions have had on him as a person. This is a very different kind of book than the first in the series. Where the first book was all about war, this one is all about the consequences of it on the man that started it all. Despite its short length, this book has a very big and important message, and it delivers it exquisitely. Many people tend to complain that this book is rather boring after the first one, but I found Paul's inner struggles to be just as, or perhaps even more entertaining than the battles of conquest and Paul's coming of age, etc from the first book. This book is remarkably better written and put together than the first book. Not only did Frank Herbert apparently do quite a bit of research in the four years between books, but he also improved on his skills as a writer quite a bit. The storyline is tighter, less convoluted and far less confusing than that of the first book. It almost reads like something written by a completely different writer because of the increased quality of the writing, and the change of focus, but at the same time, it still has his unique style and flair to it. The Bad? I have never liked the Third Person Omniscient perspective that Frank Herbert uses. This is where the story is told by a narrator in third person that will change viewpoints between characters at the drop of a hat, without warning when any given character has any important thoughts or observations on what's going on. I find it to be rather confusing and distracting at times, and I've always thought of the style as rather amateurish. This is wholly a point of opinion, and true, many very good books are written in this particular perspective, but I don't like it, and will always count it as a bad mark against any book it appears in. Frank Herbert doesn't really seem to \"get\" female characters. He doesn't really seem to understand what motivates women, how they think, how they act, how they talk, and why they do the things that they do. Going by his female characters, one could almost say that he never met a real woman in his life. As such, they are basically just men with breasts. They have all the right girly bits, because someone in the universe has to, but the their minds and personalities are about the furthest thing from feminine as is possible. Back in the '60s this was a VERY common thing, which is getting somewhat better these days, but still lingers on. Frank Herbert's portrayal of women fits those of the times, but to anyone that might be, or has ever actually met, a real woman before, it's going to feel a bit off. Back in the day this sort of thing was acceptable, but I find it to be annoying and distracting, if not downright offensive, in this day and age. In conclusion, Dune Messiah is a VERY different type of book than its predecessor Dune, and it does have its vices, but the good more than outweighs the bad by far. The focus on Paul's dilemma with the Jihad that he inadvertently started is spectacular. Watching his inner turmoil over the countless billions that have died in his name play out is excellent. And if the female characters are off, everything else is dead on. He's created a fantastic world, with fantastic people (if you think of them all as men, anyway) to live in it, and did a great deal of research to make everything from the economics to the religion feel realistic. As an entry in the Dune Saga, it's probably one of the best. Check out my other reviews."

        "text":"I'm very much looking forward to Villeneuve's interpretation of Dune that will be shown in theaters this year so I decided to not only read the original book but also the rest of the series. After seizing power and becoming emperor by marrying Princess Irulan, Paul (well, his forces, but in his name nonetheless) has sterilized hundreds of planets, killed billions of people ... and hates his own Jihad (I loved Scytale's description of it being a mental epidemic). Paul doubts the justice and righteousness of the path he has chosen, his powers of vision encounter more and more limits, and the number of people opposing the new emperor grow ever more. Even some Fremen despise Muad'ib now. While Paul and his now 15-year-old sister, Alia, rule with a council, Irulan joins a conspiracy to kill Paul. Simultaneously, Chani wishes for nothing more than to be pregnant again (not knowing that Irulan has slipped contraceptives into her diet, thus preventing a pregnancy so far ) but Irulan herself demands the privilege of bearing her empirial husband's child (and is refused, unless she accepts artificial insemination). As if all that wasn't enough, the Navigator Guild establishes an embassy on Arrakis and brings a gift (funny, considering the German word Gift): a genetic copy of Paul's former friend and teacher, Duncan Idaho. He has a part to play, of course, knows and reveals as much as he knows about it even, but things are ... complicated. Once again, everything is shrouded in lies and mysteries and tarots, partially revealed by and often misunderstood thanks to visions. So yes, there is a lot of intrigue and personal drama here. Where the first book was about fear and self-awakening, this second one more carried the tones of self-hatred and being trapped. What I especially liked about this book is that it addressed the conflict attentive readers saw coming in the previous book: how Paul had seized power and what he presented himself as to his followers could only lead to disaster. Not to mention the downside of his powers, the price he has to pay for them. Yet there were good reasons for him to do what and how he did (preventing annihilation for humanity). Nevertheless, seizing the throne is way easier than keeping it. And religious fanatism always carries within itself the seed of its own destruction. Naturally, the sandworms still are vital to the machinations and events. Here, plans are set in motion to create another melange \"factory\" on another planet. Then there were the further revelations of the complicated genetic tapestry the Bene Gesserit have weaved, the consequences, the history (for example, they aren't the only ones with such planning and Paul apparently isn't the first Kwisatz Haderach )! Personally, I liked and dreaded Alia and \"Duncan\" getting along so well since I know where it leads to (if the mini series Children of Dune follow the book(s) faithfully) - good and bad, necessary and preventable. Likewise, I knew what would happen to Chani , also thanks to the mini series Children of Dune , but hated it and was hoping it would be different here - which was, of course, impossible. In a way, Paul wasn't wrong when he said this way was better for their children - both parents out of the picture. Yet it is hard to believe. So I was definitely emotionally invested and appropriately devastated. This book, then, offers an important insight into Paul's conflict with himself and his different personas\/potentials. It also shows the same kind of insight into Alia's mind (very important considering her having awakened to Reverend Mother awareness before she was even born and, no doubt, her future role). Last but not least, it sets the tone and places important corner stones for future developments. Because if you thought this series was about Paul, you better think again! A short-ish book, very cerebral with little actual action but still thrilling thanks to the reader excitedly following the path and the story being rounded off by the periodical interludes in the fashion of historical assessments and commentary, all of which is vital to the overall mythology and establishment of important characters that will carry the rest of the saga forward. It doesn't hurt that the author is so good at making you care about certain people in a short amount of time. P.S.: Don't let the rating fool you, this is not quite as good as the first novel. It is neither as vast in scope nor as intricate. However, it is intricate in its own way, very smart, and the rating system here is limited. This scifi book is definitely in a league of its own, too."

        "text":"Philosophical and intricate, on the corrupting influence of power and opulence, combined with the unchanging march of time and the prison predestination can be Empires do not suffer emptiness of purpose at the time of their creation. It is when they have become established that aims are lost and replaced by vague ritual. Ceremony and symbolism taking over belief and morality, similar to how success on the battlefield made elite soldiers pampered and materialistic, and all that after just 12 years. Dune Messiah opens up differently than one might imagine after Dune , not with the problems of the Jihad (and the 61 billion dead it caused, which we are told in passing by Frank Herbert ) but focusing rather on the corrupting influence of enormous power and wealth. Forces are stirring against Paul and his reign, mimicking Newton’s “every action has an equal and opposite reaction” and Hegel’s pendulum take on history, but the biggest danger to the emperor comes from time and the burden the visions themselves bring with them. Bastions of power are destroyed and own power is reinforced in the end, albeit at the cost of a highest of sacrifices. I would call this book brilliant in concept, but my heart was never really touched. There are golems, resurrected flesh, vast bureaucracies and massive conspiracies. But the characters, maybe due to their elevated perception of time, feel ephemeral and going through the motions, instead of being in the moment acutely in danger. Alia, sister to Paul, being sexualised and incest being part of some plans, strikes me as very Egyptian pharaoh like. Also the whole insta love surrounding her and some other main character felt sloppy. And then we have Chani being nearly invisible, maybe speaking five sentences in the whole book... Still I am sure I will read into Children of Dune at some point, yet this sequel in my view could not stand up against Dune . Quotes in both Dutch and English: Reason is the first victim of strong emotion They are not mad. They're trained to believe, not to know. Belief can be manipulated. Only knowledge is dangerous Maar het was nou eenmaal het onvermijdelijke lot van macht om belegerd te worden Deze is praatziek maar wel diepzinnig Een keizer is meer dan een mens, zijn persoonlijkheid leidt het rijk Dit was geen lichtzinnig gedane gift, hij gaf eerlijke antwoorden op gevaarlijke vragen Truth suffers from too much analysis Zij bewoog het zwaard niet, het zwaard bewoog haar We kunnen niets voor eeuwig voorkomen Alle macht is beperkt Uw vernietigen sire? Kan iemand een god doden? Hoe kan hij zichzelf tegen zichzelf beschermen? Daar geloof je niets van dus waarom zou je het zeggen? De mensen willen geen boekhouder als keizer maar een meester, iemand die hen beschermd tegen veranderingen Jouw waarachtigheid is gevaarlijk Je bent dronken van teveel tijd Jij bent bang voor je eigen macht Je troost me met doorns Here lies a toppled god. His fall was not a small one. We did but build his pedestal, A narrow and a tall one. You do not beg the sun for mercy. Mijn regering is de economie Was het een nederlaag als je van twee kwaden de minste kiest? Te veel vrijheid kweekt wanorde Hij hield hen allen in de palm van zijn visioen De macht die zelfs de allemachtigsten kunnen uitoefenen zonder zichzelf te vernietigen is begrensd Ik zal doen wat de liefde van me verlangd Ik sterf aan mijn eigen voorzienigheid Maar er zijn problemen in dit heelal waarvoor geen oplossing bestaat There are problems in this universe for which there are no answers. Nothing. Nothing can be done."

When Adolph Ochs, the son of poor Jewish immigrants, bought the bankrupt New York Times in 1896, he transformed it into America's most respected and powerful newspaper. His family's values and prejudices set the agenda for the paper and came to set the agenda for the nation. The Trust is a dramatic saga set against a backdrop of world events, succession battles, and the burden and privilege of wealth and power. Spanning four generations, The Trust tells the story of Ochs, a visionary plagued by depression and insecurity; his daughter Iphigene, who fiercely guarded the family mystique; her husband, Arthur Hays Sulzberger, the paper's most controversial publisher; their son Punch, whose amiable nature masked a steely toughness; and Arthur Jr., the brash successor, who is leading the Times into the future.

        "text":"Page 46 (my book) In the end Adolph (the publisher) decided he liked his own invention [catchphrase] best and decided to keep it. In early February, 1897 “All the News That’s Fit to Print” appeared for the first time in the upper-left-hand corner of the front page where it remains today. This book is the history of the New York Times starting when Adolph Simon Ochs purchased it in 1896. At that stage the newspaper (then written as The New-York Times) was failing. Adolph turned that around and made it a success and kept it as a quality newspaper as opposed to the bulk of the New York sensationalist tabloids of that era. One of his most risky and fruitful ventures was to lower the price from three cents to one cent! This increased both circulation and advertising. Adolph Ochs and his spouse Effie Marian Wise had only one child Iphigene, who married Arthur Hays Sulzberger in 1917. Although Iphigene never became publisher, she was the ruling matriarch of the New York Times. She lived until the age of 97 (she died in 1990). Iphigene was liberal in outlook and her influence was felt through several generations of publishers - on her husband Arthur Hays Sulzberger (publisher from 1935-61), the short publishing reign of her son-in-law Orvil E. Dryfoos (publisher 1961-63), her son Arthur Ochs Sulzberger (commonly known as “Punch”, publisher 1963-92), and her grandson Arthur Ochs Sulzberger Jr who ended his reign in 2017 – and gave it to his son – yes, you guessed it, his name too is Arthur. (Note that this book was published in 1999; I looked the last couple of publishing years on the internet.) As all this aptly demonstrates the New York Times is a family run newspaper. As the authors point out it has the features of both a corporate enterprise and a monarchy. In many ways the Ochs-Sulzbergers over the years have tried to be as inauspicious as possible. They kept their Jewish roots hidden, Adolph in particular never gave prominence to Jewish issues in his newspaper. I did find the authors continuing emphasis on the “modesty” of the family clan through the decades over the top. They lived with the ruling matriarch Iphigene in a large estate, Hillandale, in Connecticut and had nice apartments in Manhattan with servants. They were a part of the New York City elites. Punch Sulzberger had a dominant position on the board of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. This is a family history where we get loads of information on marriages, births and deaths – and affairs and transgressions. Too much I felt. I would have liked more chapters like the one on the Pentagon Papers. The far-flung international reporters of the Times get little mention (except for Cyrus Sulzberger). The cataclysm of the Civil Rights era in the 1950’s and 1960’s is not mentioned at all – even though they were often front-page news. It would have been interesting to know how the publishers and their families reacted to these events and the impact they had on the New York Times. There is little on the rise of the woman’s movement and the Vietnam war protests that occurred across the United States. There is much as to how the newspaper evolved in a mechanical sense. Up to the 1960’s there were only two sections – and then special feature sections were introduced. There were many labour strikes where the newspaper did not publish over several weeks. Orvil E. Dryfoos, in 1963, suffered a fatal heart attack due to the stress from this labour dispute. This book was published in 1999 so we do not get to know the full brunt of the internet revolution on the New York Times. Page 607 The physical embodiment of the company’s soaring fortune was the edition of Sunday, September 13, 1987 – at 1,602 pages, the largest in Times history. Even though there is a hereditary process to the main management position of publisher (and other significant positions as well) let it be known that the family members (mostly male it would seem) undergo ample training at various posts in the business. They get to know their empire from bottom to top. Even though the family is tolerant, woe betide an employee (in particular a high-level one) who does not cooperate in this training of family members. It will be compelling how this monarchy continues to rule The New York Times as the family tree has greatly expanded from what it was in the mid-twentieth century. And as the authors state the importance of the voice of The New York Times continues to be felt over the years. Page 597 In 1976, when U.S. News and World Report had published a cover story on the nations top thirty leaders, headlined “Who Runs America” President Gerald Ford had come in first, Punch [The New York Times publisher] at number thirteen. When the survey was repeated in 1982, Punch was still ranked thirteen, but everyone else above him had changed. … Presidents had their moments on the national stage and world stage, but The New York Times remained a constant, a power unto itself."

If you’re really interested in the history of the NYT and the intertwined histories and machinations of the Ochs\/Sulzberger extended clan as such relate to the Paper, it’s hard to imagine a book better sourced or more thoroughly done. The Trust did take me a bit to get into, and I kept returning to the family tree at the start of the book to keep all the characters straight, but once I put in the effort, this book was definitely worth the read. Probably the definitive modern history of the Times. Highly recommend for those deeply interested in print media in general or the New York Times in particular."

The ownership has passed from father to son with son in laws stepping in when no sons were available. Hence the Sulzbergers. This is an entertaining, gossipy account but the history of the paper and significance of the paper, its great reporters. and columnists is totally subordinated to tales of the family which isn't all that interesting. The coverage of the turbulent 12 years of the paper's struggle with New York Typographical Union is so incomplete and shoddy that one must wonder about how reliable the rest of the book is. The book ends in 1999 which is unfortunate because the last decade has been a disaster for newspapers in general and the NYTimes in particular and one wonders whether newsprint, hard copy newspapers are a business model that can continue to exist for another twenty years.

This book ends in 2000 so you don't have much insight into why the paper has lurched so left (it supported Deblasio!) in the 21st century however the general trend especially in the 1990's was in that direction and this comes out with Arthur Golden Jr taking over in the 1990's. Also, its admiration of the family sometimes seeps through causing it too not be as impartial as it should be. As with Wikipedia or the news in general what is and is not stated represents Defacto editorial comments. Some of the disconnects: - One of the big failures of the NYT was the failure to recognize and speak out more forcefully against the rise of Nazism- and this is brought out several times in the book and is probably a legitimate complaint. Conversely, even though the NYT is proud of its many Pulitzer Prizes, Walter Duranty, the NYT communist apologist is never even mentioned. In one bizarre scene, the progressive matriarch (Iphigénie) of one of the owners is on a trip to China, dancing on the Great Wall and meeting the communist leadership in the early 1970's. This is commented on without criticism by the authors- even though China was in the middle of the \"Great Leap Forward\" which had cumulatively killed over 50 million people through starvation. Indeed, the number of communists on the paper is never addressed (though alluded to several times)- especially in the 1950's. One would have imagined that if there were fascist on the paper at that time there would have been some comment. - Everyone in the family seems to get divorced multiple times. The lack of fidelity (or picking the right partner) seems rampant. This is not addressed. It may be an affliction of the intelligentsia. - Several times it is mentioned that up until the Eisenhower the paper had endorsed Republicans as many times as Democrats. Nevertheless, after the early 1960's the paper did not endorse any republicans (including those running for local offices). This is tied into a general blindness to bias and diversity both within the NYT but also to the authors and to me is a flaw of the paper. - The family, as they progress, increasingly are more and more disconnected from the real world especially starting in the 1950's. The later generations are all educated (usually with mediocre grades) at liberal arts colleges. Military service in the family seemed to stop mid-century. In one telling example, the husband of one family member was in construction- which was looked down upon. There are no architects, engineers, farmers, oil workers in the family. This is one flaw of the book- it continues to emphasis the modesty of the family... but these people mix with other elites and have elite liberal viewpoints- there is little diversity in thought. This may be related to the frequent divorces and marital infidelities- a chronic problem of the intelligentsia. You walk away from this with both an appreciation for the advantages as well as the concerns with what it means to be a family run business. While you may have considerable concerns about the NYT this book is a very good and well researched history that attempts and largely succeeds in being impartial."

        "text":"Page 46 (my book) In the end Adolph (the publisher) decided he liked his own invention [catchphrase] best and decided to keep it. In early February, 1897 “All the News That’s Fit to Print” appeared for the first time in the upper-left-hand corner of the front page where it remains today. This book is the history of the New York Times starting when Adolph Simon Ochs purchased it in 1896. At that stage the newspaper (then written as The New-York Times) was failing. Adolph turned that around and made it a success and kept it as a quality newspaper as opposed to the bulk of the New York sensationalist tabloids of that era. One of his most risky and fruitful ventures was to lower the price from three cents to one cent! This increased both circulation and advertising. Adolph Ochs and his spouse Effie Marian Wise had only one child Iphigene, who married Arthur Hays Sulzberger in 1917. Although Iphigene never became publisher, she was the ruling matriarch of the New York Times. She lived until the age of 97 (she died in 1990). Iphigene was liberal in outlook and her influence was felt through several generations of publishers - on her husband Arthur Hays Sulzberger (publisher from 1935-61), the short publishing reign of her son-in-law Orvil E. Dryfoos (publisher 1961-63), her son Arthur Ochs Sulzberger (commonly known as “Punch”, publisher 1963-92), and her grandson Arthur Ochs Sulzberger Jr who ended his reign in 2017 – and gave it to his son – yes, you guessed it, his name too is Arthur. (Note that this book was published in 1999; I looked the last couple of publishing years on the internet.) As all this aptly demonstrates the New York Times is a family run newspaper. As the authors point out it has the features of both a corporate enterprise and a monarchy. In many ways the Ochs-Sulzbergers over the years have tried to be as inauspicious as possible. They kept their Jewish roots hidden, Adolph in particular never gave prominence to Jewish issues in his newspaper. I did find the authors continuing emphasis on the “modesty” of the family clan through the decades over the top. They lived with the ruling matriarch Iphigene in a large estate, Hillandale, in Connecticut and had nice apartments in Manhattan with servants. They were a part of the New York City elites. Punch Sulzberger had a dominant position on the board of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. This is a family history where we get loads of information on marriages, births and deaths – and affairs and transgressions. Too much I felt. I would have liked more chapters like the one on the Pentagon Papers. The far-flung international reporters of the Times get little mention (except for Cyrus Sulzberger). The cataclysm of the Civil Rights era in the 1950’s and 1960’s is not mentioned at all – even though they were often front-page news. It would have been interesting to know how the publishers and their families reacted to these events and the impact they had on the New York Times. There is little on the rise of the woman’s movement and the Vietnam war protests that occurred across the United States. There is much as to how the newspaper evolved in a mechanical sense. Up to the 1960’s there were only two sections – and then special feature sections were introduced. There were many labour strikes where the newspaper did not publish over several weeks. Orvil E. Dryfoos, in 1963, suffered a fatal heart attack due to the stress from this labour dispute. This book was published in 1999 so we do not get to know the full brunt of the internet revolution on the New York Times. Page 607 The physical embodiment of the company’s soaring fortune was the edition of Sunday, September 13, 1987 – at 1,602 pages, the largest in Times history. Even though there is a hereditary process to the main management position of publisher (and other significant positions as well) let it be known that the family members (mostly male it would seem) undergo ample training at various posts in the business. They get to know their empire from bottom to top. Even though the family is tolerant, woe betide an employee (in particular a high-level one) who does not cooperate in this training of family members. It will be compelling how this monarchy continues to rule The New York Times as the family tree has greatly expanded from what it was in the mid-twentieth century. And as the authors state the importance of the voice of The New York Times continues to be felt over the years. Page 597 In 1976, when U.S. News and World Report had published a cover story on the nations top thirty leaders, headlined “Who Runs America” President Gerald Ford had come in first, Punch [The New York Times publisher] at number thirteen. When the survey was repeated in 1982, Punch was still ranked thirteen, but everyone else above him had changed. … Presidents had their moments on the national stage and world stage, but The New York Times remained a constant, a power unto itself."

If you’re really interested in the history of the NYT and the intertwined histories and machinations of the Ochs\/Sulzberger extended clan as such relate to the Paper, it’s hard to imagine a book better sourced or more thoroughly done. The Trust did take me a bit to get into, and I kept returning to the family tree at the start of the book to keep all the characters straight, but once I put in the effort, this book was definitely worth the read. Probably the definitive modern history of the Times. Highly recommend for those deeply interested in print media in general or the New York Times in particular."

        "text":"Page 46 (my book) In the end Adolph (the publisher) decided he liked his own invention [catchphrase] best and decided to keep it. In early February, 1897 “All the News That’s Fit to Print” appeared for the first time in the upper-left-hand corner of the front page where it remains today. This book is the history of the New York Times starting when Adolph Simon Ochs purchased it in 1896. At that stage the newspaper (then written as The New-York Times) was failing. Adolph turned that around and made it a success and kept it as a quality newspaper as opposed to the bulk of the New York sensationalist tabloids of that era. One of his most risky and fruitful ventures was to lower the price from three cents to one cent! This increased both circulation and advertising. Adolph Ochs and his spouse Effie Marian Wise had only one child Iphigene, who married Arthur Hays Sulzberger in 1917. Although Iphigene never became publisher, she was the ruling matriarch of the New York Times. She lived until the age of 97 (she died in 1990). Iphigene was liberal in outlook and her influence was felt through several generations of publishers - on her husband Arthur Hays Sulzberger (publisher from 1935-61), the short publishing reign of her son-in-law Orvil E. Dryfoos (publisher 1961-63), her son Arthur Ochs Sulzberger (commonly known as “Punch”, publisher 1963-92), and her grandson Arthur Ochs Sulzberger Jr who ended his reign in 2017 – and gave it to his son – yes, you guessed it, his name too is Arthur. (Note that this book was published in 1999; I looked the last couple of publishing years on the internet.) As all this aptly demonstrates the New York Times is a family run newspaper. As the authors point out it has the features of both a corporate enterprise and a monarchy. In many ways the Ochs-Sulzbergers over the years have tried to be as inauspicious as possible. They kept their Jewish roots hidden, Adolph in particular never gave prominence to Jewish issues in his newspaper. I did find the authors continuing emphasis on the “modesty” of the family clan through the decades over the top. They lived with the ruling matriarch Iphigene in a large estate, Hillandale, in Connecticut and had nice apartments in Manhattan with servants. They were a part of the New York City elites. Punch Sulzberger had a dominant position on the board of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. This is a family history where we get loads of information on marriages, births and deaths – and affairs and transgressions. Too much I felt. I would have liked more chapters like the one on the Pentagon Papers. The far-flung international reporters of the Times get little mention (except for Cyrus Sulzberger). The cataclysm of the Civil Rights era in the 1950’s and 1960’s is not mentioned at all – even though they were often front-page news. It would have been interesting to know how the publishers and their families reacted to these events and the impact they had on the New York Times. There is little on the rise of the woman’s movement and the Vietnam war protests that occurred across the United States. There is much as to how the newspaper evolved in a mechanical sense. Up to the 1960’s there were only two sections – and then special feature sections were introduced. There were many labour strikes where the newspaper did not publish over several weeks. Orvil E. Dryfoos, in 1963, suffered a fatal heart attack due to the stress from this labour dispute. This book was published in 1999 so we do not get to know the full brunt of the internet revolution on the New York Times. Page 607 The physical embodiment of the company’s soaring fortune was the edition of Sunday, September 13, 1987 – at 1,602 pages, the largest in Times history. Even though there is a hereditary process to the main management position of publisher (and other significant positions as well) let it be known that the family members (mostly male it would seem) undergo ample training at various posts in the business. They get to know their empire from bottom to top. Even though the family is tolerant, woe betide an employee (in particular a high-level one) who does not cooperate in this training of family members. It will be compelling how this monarchy continues to rule The New York Times as the family tree has greatly expanded from what it was in the mid-twentieth century. And as the authors state the importance of the voice of The New York Times continues to be felt over the years. Page 597 In 1976, when U.S. News and World Report had published a cover story on the nations top thirty leaders, headlined “Who Runs America” President Gerald Ford had come in first, Punch [The New York Times publisher] at number thirteen. When the survey was repeated in 1982, Punch was still ranked thirteen, but everyone else above him had changed. … Presidents had their moments on the national stage and world stage, but The New York Times remained a constant, a power unto itself."

If you’re really interested in the history of the NYT and the intertwined histories and machinations of the Ochs\/Sulzberger extended clan as such relate to the Paper, it’s hard to imagine a book better sourced or more thoroughly done. The Trust did take me a bit to get into, and I kept returning to the family tree at the start of the book to keep all the characters straight, but once I put in the effort, this book was definitely worth the read. Probably the definitive modern history of the Times. Highly recommend for those deeply interested in print media in general or the New York Times in particular."

He was so in debt it took him 20 years to truly own it. That guy had some large cojones... - The author really played up the stiff competition each generation for publishership.

The ownership has passed from father to son with son in laws stepping in when no sons were available. Hence the Sulzbergers. This is an entertaining, gossipy account but the history of the paper and significance of the paper, its great reporters. and columnists is totally subordinated to tales of the family which isn't all that interesting. The coverage of the turbulent 12 years of the paper's struggle with New York Typographical Union is so incomplete and shoddy that one must wonder about how reliable the rest of the book is. The book ends in 1999 which is unfortunate because the last decade has been a disaster for newspapers in general and the NYTimes in particular and one wonders whether newsprint, hard copy newspapers are a business model that can continue to exist for another twenty years. Read the book, the Paper an account of the Herald Tribune which is far more impressive."

        "text":"Very well documented and interesting. It tries to stay neutral and non-judgmental with both the family members and the paper as a whole. This book ends in 2000 so you don't have much insight into why the paper has lurched so left (it supported Deblasio!) in the 21st century however the general trend especially in the 1990's was in that direction and this comes out with Arthur Golden Jr taking over in the 1990's. Also, its admiration of the family sometimes seeps through causing it too not be as impartial as it should be. As with Wikipedia or the news in general what is and is not stated represents Defacto editorial comments. Some of the disconnects: - One of the big failures of the NYT was the failure to recognize and speak out more forcefully against the rise of Nazism- and this is brought out several times in the book and is probably a legitimate complaint. Conversely, even though the NYT is proud of its many Pulitzer Prizes, Walter Duranty, the NYT communist apologist is never even mentioned. In one bizarre scene, the progressive matriarch (Iphigénie) of one of the owners is on a trip to China, dancing on the Great Wall and meeting the communist leadership in the early 1970's. This is commented on without criticism by the authors- even though China was in the middle of the \"Great Leap Forward\" which had cumulatively killed over 50 million people through starvation. Indeed, the number of communists on the paper is never addressed (though alluded to several times)- especially in the 1950's. One would have imagined that if there were fascist on the paper at that time there would have been some comment. - Everyone in the family seems to get divorced multiple times. The lack of fidelity (or picking the right partner) seems rampant. This is not addressed. It may be an affliction of the intelligentsia. - Several times it is mentioned that up until the Eisenhower the paper had endorsed Republicans as many times as Democrats. Nevertheless, after the early 1960's the paper did not endorse any republicans (including those running for local offices). This is tied into a general blindness to bias and diversity both within the NYT but also to the authors and to me is a flaw of the paper. - The family, as they progress, increasingly are more and more disconnected from the real world especially starting in the 1950's. The later generations are all educated (usually with mediocre grades) at liberal arts colleges. Military service in the family seemed to stop mid-century. In one telling example, the husband of one family member was in construction- which was looked down upon. There are no architects, engineers, farmers, oil workers in the family. This is one flaw of the book- it continues to emphasis the modesty of the family... but these people mix with other elites and have elite liberal viewpoints- there is little diversity in thought. This may be related to the frequent divorces and marital infidelities- a chronic problem of the intelligentsia. You walk away from this with both an appreciation for the advantages as well as the concerns with what it means to be a family run business. While you may have considerable concerns about the NYT this book is a very good and well researched history that attempts and largely succeeds in being impartial."

These \"recipes\" aren't intended to document everything completely, but to give you a good understanding of it, and tell you where to look for more information. They're like mini-tutorials. Plus, this book also provides fun little tricks that aren't necessarily useful, but really interesting. These are like dessert recipes. The best part is, most everything in this book is well-written and easy to follow. Things I thought I'd already understood, this book helped me understand better, and it really got me a lot more comfortable reading Ruby code. The book is also arranged in a very logical way. I think this is the perfect reference manual, not only for syntax, but also for how to solve problems. And yet, despite its enormous size and excellence as a reference, it's also surprisingly easy to just read cover-to-cover."

    "desc":"Married to a powerful government minister, Anna Karenina is a beautiful woman who falls deeply in love with a wealthy army officer, the elegant Count Vronsky. Desperate to find truth and meaning in her life, she rashly defies the conventions of Russian society and leaves her husband and son to live with her lover. Condemned and ostracized by her peers and prone to fits of jealousy that alienate Vronsky, Anna finds herself unable to escape an increasingly hopeless situation. Set against this tragic affair is the story of Konstantin Levin, a melancholy landowner whom Tolstoy based largely on himself. While Anna looks for happiness through love, Levin embarks on his own search for spiritual fulfillment through marriage, family, and hard work. Surrounding these two central plot threads are dozens of characters whom Tolstoy seamlessly weaves together, creating a breathtaking tapestry of nineteenth-century Russian society. From its famous opening sentence — \"Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way”—to its stunningly tragic conclusion, this enduring tale of marriage and adultery plumbs the very depths of the human soul.",

        "text":"As a daughter of a Russian literature teacher, it seems I have always known the story of Anna Karenina: the love, the affair, the train - the whole shebang. I must have ingested the knowledge with my mother's milk, as Russians would say. My grandpa had an old print of a painting hanging in his garage. A young beautiful mysterious woman sitting in a carriage in wintry Moscow and looking at the viewer through her heavy-lidded eyes with a stare that combines allure and deep sadness. \"Who's that?\" I asked my grandpa when I was five, and without missing a beat he answered, \"Anna Karenina\" . Actually, it was \"A Stranger\" by Ivan Kramskoy (1883) - but for me it has always remained the mysterious and beautiful Anna Karenina, the femme fatale of Russian literature. (Imagine my childish glee when I saw this portrait used for the cover of this book in the edition I chose!) Yet, \"Anna Karenina\" is a misleading title for this hefty tome as Anna's story is just the tip of an iceberg, as half of the story is devoted to Konstantin Levin, Tolstoy's alter ego (Count Leo's Russian name was Lev. Lev --> Levin), preoccupied with Russian peasantry and its relationship to land, as well as torn over faith and his lack of it, Levin whose story continues for chapters after Anna meets her train. But Anna gives the book its name, and her plight spoke more to me than the philosophical dealings of an insecure and soul-searching Russian landowner, and so her story comes first. Sorry, Leo Levin. Anna's chapters tell a story of a beautiful married woman who had a passionate affair with an officer and then somehow, in her quest for love, began a downward spiral fueled by jealousy and guilt and societal prejudices and stifling attitudes. \" But I'm glad you will see me as I am. The chief thing I shouldn't like would be for people to imagine I want to prove anything. I don't want to prove anything; I merely want to live, to do no one harm but myself. I have the right to do that, haven't I? \" On one hand, there's little new about the story of a forbidden, passionate, overwhelming affair resulting in societal scorn and the double standards towards a man and a woman involved in the same act. Few readers will be surprised that it is Anna who gets the blame for the affair, that it is Anna who is considered \"fallen\" and undesirable in the society, that it is Anna who is dependent on men in whichever relationship she is in because by societal norms of that time a woman was little else but a companion to her man. There is nothing new about the sad contrasts between the opportunities available to men and to women of that time - and the strong sense of superiority that men feel in this patriarchial world. No, there is nothing else in that, tragic as it may be. \" Anything, only not divorce!\" answered Darya Alexandrovna. \"But what is anything?\" \"No, it is awful! She will be no one's wife, she will be lost! \" No, where Lev Tolstoy excels is the portrayal of Anna's breakdown, Anna's downward spiral, the unraveling of her character under the ingrained guilt, crippling insecurity and the pressure the others - and she herself - place on her. Anna, a lovely, energetic, captivating woman, full of life and beauty, simply crumbles, sinks into despair, fueled by desperation and irrationality and misdirected passion. \" And he tried to think of her as she was when he met her the first time, at a railway station too, mysterious, exquisite, loving, seeking and giving happiness, and not cruelly revengeful as he remembered her on that last moment. \" A calm and poised lady slowly and terrifyingly descends into fickle moods and depression and almost maniacal liveliness in between, tormented by her feeling of (imagined) abandonment and little self-worth and false passions which are little else but futile attempts to fill the void, the never-ending emptiness... This is what Tolstoy is a master at describing, and this is what was grabbing my heart and squeezing the joy out of it in anticipation of inevitable tragedy to come. \" In her eyes the whole of him, with all his habits, ideas, desires, with all his spiritual and physical temperament, was one thing—love for women, and that love, she felt, ought to be entirely concentrated on her alone. That love was less; consequently, as she reasoned, he must have transferred part of his love to other women or to another woman—and she was jealous. She was jealous not of any particular woman but of the decrease of his love. Not having got an object for her jealousy, she was on the lookout for it. At the slightest hint she transferred her jealousy from one object to another. \" Yes, it's the little evils, the multitude of little faces of unhappiness that Count Tolstoy knows how to portray with such sense of reality that it's quite unsettling - be it the blind jealousy of Anna or Levin, be it the shameless cheating and spending of Stiva Oblonsky, be it the moral stuffiness and limits of Arkady Karenin, the parental neglects of both Karenins to their children, the lies, the little societal snipes, the disappointments, the failures, the pervasive selfishness... All of it is so unsettlingly well-captured on page that you do realize Tolstoy must have believed in the famous phrase that he penned for this book's opening line: \"Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.\" Tolstoy is excellent at showing that, despite what we tend to believe, getting what you wanted does not bring happiness. \" Vronsky, meanwhile, in spite of the complete realization of what he had so long desired, was not perfectly happy. He soon felt that the realization of his desires gave him no more than a grain of sand out of the mountain of happiness he had expected. It showed him the mistake men make in picturing to themselves happiness as the realization of their desires. \" And yet, just like in real life, there are no real villains, no real unsympathetic characters that cause obstacles for our heroes, the villains whom it feels good to hate. No, everyone, in addition to their pathetic little ugly traits also has redeeming qualities. Anna's husband, despite appearing as a monster to Anna after her passionate affair, still is initially willing to give her the freedom of the divorce that she needs. Stiva Oblonsky, repulsive in his carelessness and cheating, wins us over with his gregarious and genuinely friendly personality; Anna herself, despite her outbursts, is a devoted mother to her son (at least initially). Levin may appear to be monstrous in his jealousy, but the next moment he is so overwhelmingly in love that it's hard not to forgive him. And I love this greyness of each character, so lifelike and full. And, of course, the politics - so easily forgettable by readers of this book that carries the name of the heroine of a passionate forbidden affair. The dreaded politics that bored me to tears when I was fifteen. And yet these are the politics and the questions that were so much on the mind of Count Tolstoy, famous to his compatriots for his love and devotion to peasants, that he devoted almost half of this thick tome to it, discussed through the thoughts of Konstantin Levin . Levin, a landowner with a strong capacity for compassion, self-reflection and curiosity about Russian love for land, as well as a striking political apathy, is Tolstoy's avatar in trying to make sense of a puzzling Russian peasantry culture, which failed to be understood by many of his compatriots educated on the ideas and beliefs of industrialized Europe. \" He considered a revolution in economic conditions nonsense. But he always felt the injustice of his own abundance in comparison with the poverty of the peasants, and now he determined that so as to feel quite in the right, though he had worked hard and lived by no means luxuriously before, he would now work still harder, and would allow himself even less luxury. \" I have to say - I understood his ideas more this time, but I could not really feel for the efforts of the devoted and kind landowner striving to understand the soul of Russian peasants. Maybe it's because I mentally kept fast-forwarding mere 50 years, to the Socialist Revolution of 1917 that would leave most definitely Levin and Kitty and their children dead, or less likely, in exile; the revolution which, as Tolstoy almost predicted, focused on the workers and despised the loved by Count Leo peasants, the revolution that despised the love for owning land and working it that Tolstoy felt was at the center of the Russian soul. But it is still incredibly interesting to think about and to analyze because even a century and a half later there's still enough truth and foresight in Tolstoy's musings, after all. Even if I disagree with so many of his views, they are still thought-provoking, no doubts about it. \" If he had been asked whether he liked or didn't like the peasants, Konstantin Levin would have been absolutely at a loss what to reply. He liked and did not like the peasants, just as he liked and did not like men in general. Of course, being a good-hearted man, he liked men rather than he disliked them, and so too with the peasants. But like or dislike \"the people\" as something apart he could not, not only because he lived with \"the people,\" and all his interests were bound up with theirs, but also because he regarded himself as a part of \"the people,\" did not see any special qualities or failings distinguishing himself and \"the people,\" and could not contrast himself with them. \" ======================== It's a 3.5 star book for me. Why? Well, because of Tolstoy's prose, of course - because of its wordiness and repetitiveness. Yes, Tolstoy is the undisputed king of creating page-long sentences (which I love, by the way - love that is owed in full to my literature-teacher mother admiring them and making me punctuate these never-ending sentences correctly for grammar exercises). But he is also a master of restating the obvious, repeating the same thought over and over and over again in the same sentence, in the same paragraph, until the reader is ready to cry for some respite. This, as well as Levin's at times obnoxious preachiness and the author's frequently very patriarchial views, was what made this book substantially less enjoyable than it could have been. -------- By the way, there is an excellent 1967 Soviet film based on this book that captures the spirit of the book quite well (and, if you so like, has a handy function to turn on English subtitles): first part is here , and the second part is here . I highly recommend this film. And even better version of this classic is the British TV adaptation (2000) with stunning Helen McCrory as perfect Anna and lovely Paloma Baeza as perfect Kitty."

        "text":"***Spoiler alert. If you have read this book, please proceed. If you are never going to read this novel (be honest with yourself), then please proceed. If you may read this novel, but it may be decades in the future, then please proceed. Trust me, you are not going to remember, no matter how compelling a review I have written. If you need Tolstoy talking points for your next cocktail party or soiree with those literary, black wearing, pseudo intellectual friends of yours, then this review will come in handy. If they pin you to the board like a bug over some major plot twist, that will be because I have not shared any of those. If this happens, do not despair; refer them to my review. I’ll take the heat for you. If they don’t know who I am, then they are, frankly, not worth knowing. Exchange them for other more enlightened intellectual friends.*** “He soon felt that the fulfillment of his desires gave him only one grain of the mountain of happiness he had expected. This fulfillment showed him the eternal error men make in imagining that their happiness depends on the realization of their desires.” Anna Arkadyevna married Alexei Alexandrovich Karenin, a man twenty years her senior. She dutifully produced a son for him and settled into a life of social events and extravagant clothes and enjoyed a freedom from financial worries. Maybe this life would have continued for her if she had never met Count Alexei Kirillovich Vronsky, but more than likely, her midlife crisis, her awareness of the passage of time, would have compelled her to seek something more. ”They say he’s a religious, moral, honest, intelligent man; but they don’t see what I’ve seen. They don’t know how he has been stifling my life for eight years, stifling everything that was alive in me, but he never once even thought that I was a living woman who needed love. They don’t know how he insulted me at every step and remained pleased with himself. Didn’t I try as hard as I could to find a justification for my life? Didn’t I try to love him… But the time has come, I’ve realized that I can no longer deceive myself, that I am alive, that I am not to blame if God has made me so that I must love and live. And what now? If he killed me, if he killed him, I could bear it all, I could forgive it all, but no, he….” Her husband was enamored with her, but then so was everyone who met her, male or female. Maybe he was too contented with their life together and, therefore, took their relationship for granted. He was two decades older, so the passions of romance didn’t burn with as hot a flame. She wanted passion from him even if it was to murder her lover and herself. Even if it was something tragic, she wanted something to happen, something that would make her feel... something. I couldn’t help thinking early on that the problem wasn’t with her husband, certainly nothing that a new lover could fix for very long. The same face was always going to greet her in the mirror. The same thoughts were always going to swim their way back to the surface. We can not mask the problems within ourselves by changing lovers. The mask will eventually slip, and all will be revealed. Ugly can be very pretty. Is there such a thing as being too beautiful? Can being so beautiful make someone cold, disdainful, and unable to really feel empathy or even connected to those around them? Her type of beauty is a shield that insulates her even as her insecurities swing the sword that stabs the hearts of those who despise her and those who love her. ”She was enchanting in her simple black dress, enchanting were her full arms with the bracelets on them, enchanting her firm neck with its string of pearls, enchanting her curly hair in disarray, enchanting the graceful, light movements of her small feet and hands, enchanting that beautiful face in its animation; but there was something terrible and cruel in her enchantment.” My favorite character in this epic was Konstantin (Kostya) Dmitrich Levin. He was a well meaning, wealthy landowner who, unusually for the times, went out and worked the land himself. He got his hands dirty enough that one could actually call him a farmer. He was led to believe by his friends and even the Shcherbatsky family that their youngest daughter, Kitty, would be an affable match for him. Kitty’s older sister Dolly was married to Stepan (Stiva) Arkadyich Oblonsky, who was the brother to Anna Karenina. Stiva was recently caught and forgiven for having a dalliance with a household staff, but no sooner was he out of that boiling water of that affair before he was having liaisons with a ballerina. This did lead me to believe that life would never be satisfying for either Stiva or his sister Anna because there was always going to be pretty butterflies to chase as the attractiveness of the one they had began to fade. Before Vronsky became gobsmacked by Anna, he was leisurely chasing after Kitty and leading her on just long enough for Kitty to turn Levin’s marriage proposal down flat. That was like catching a molotok (hammer) right between the eyes as a serp (sickle) swept Kostya off his feet. Interestingly enough, later in the book Levin met Anna Karenina, after he has married Kitty (you’ll have to read the book to discover how this comes about), and he was captivated by Anna. It was almost enough for me start chain smoking Turkish cigarettes or biting my nails down to the quick while I waited for the outcome. Substitute Anna for Jolene, and you’ll know what I was humming. ”She had unconsciously done everything she could to arouse a feeling of love for her in Levin, and though she knew that she had succeeded in it, as far as one could with regard to an honest, married man in one evening, and though she liked him very much, as soon as he left the room, she stopped thinking about him.” If she was irritated with Vronsky, one day maybe she would just seduce Levin for entertainment... because she could. I must say that I didn’t think much of Vronsky at the beginning of the novel, but as the plot progressed I started to sympathize with him. Tolstoy was brilliant at rounding out characters so our preconceived notions or the projections of ourselves that we place upon them are forced to be modified as we discover more about them. Levin had his own problems. He had been reading the great philosophers, looking for answers. He found more questions than answers in religion. He abandoned every lifeboat he climbed into and swam for the next one. ”Without knowing what I am and why I’m here, it is impossible for me to live. And I cannot know that, therefore I cannot live.” The problem that every reasonably intelligent person wrestles with is that no matter how successful we are, no matter how wonderful a life we build, or how well we take care of ourselves, we are going to die. It is irrefutable. Cemeteries don’t lie. Well, there is a lot of eternal lying down going on, but no duplicity. None of us are going to escape the reaper. No one is ascending on a cloud or going to the crossroads to make a deal with the Devil. We all have to come face to face with death, and we can’t take any of our bobbles, accolades, or power with us. So the question that Levin ended up asking himself, the Biggest question even beyond, why am I here? is: Why do anything? Without immortality, everything we attempt to do can seem futile. Some would make the case that we live on in our kids and grandkids. I say bugger to that. I want more time! Well, there are ways to be immortal, and one of them is to write a masterpiece like Anna Karenina that will live forever. By the end, I am ready to throttle Anna until her pretty eyes bug out of her head and her cheeks turn a vibrant pink, but at the same time, she seemed to be suffering from a host of mental disorders. She was so cut off from everyone and so disdainful of everyone. ”It was impossible not to hate such pathetically ugly people.” The “friends” she had had been ostracized from her by her own actions. I had to believe her loathing of people was a projection of how she felt about herself. She needed some time on Carl Jung’s couch, but he was a wee tot when this book was published. She needed to find some satisfaction in the ordinary and quit believing that a change in geography or in lovers was ever going to fix what was wrong with herself. She had such a destructive personality. One man tried to kill himself from her actions and another contemplated the act. She was maliciously vengeful when someone didn’t do something she wanted them to do; and yet, I couldn’t quite condemn her completely. Her feelings of being stifled were perfectly natural. We all feel that way at points in our lives. We feel trapped by the circumstances of our life. Her attempt to break free in the 1870s in Russian society was brave\/foolish. She sacrificed everything to chase a dream. The dream ate her. This book is a masterpiece, not just a Russian masterpiece but a true gift to the world of literature.

IT'S PROJECT LONG CLASSIC TIME, the fan favorite in which i read a very long book divided up into little bits over the course of the month, and usually i drag elle along with me except this month i'm planning something truly nightmarish so i'm starting while she's asleep as an act of terror \/ peer pressure. let's do this. DAY 1: PAGES 1-25 my tbr review of this was \"sometimes i like to pretend i'm capable of reading thousand-page books. just for fun,\" and in this case that pretending includes starting 2 days early and doubling up eventually so that i can read in 25 page chunks. i'm cool like that. damn! that opening line! we are off to the races. DAY 2: PAGES 26-75 didn't even intend to make today my bonus day but this is just so readable. why didn't anyone tell me the 900 page classic from 150 years ago is unputdownable?? i fear i may adore all of these characters. DAY 3: 76-100 in a state of bliss right now in which i look forward to reading this every day but am relishing it so much that dividing it into sections works perfectly. DAY 4: 101-125 literally any book is doable in teeny chunks like this. i had negative free time (and a negative interest) today but boom. easy money. DAY 5: 126-150 the descriptions of emotions in this...sheesh. excellence. DAY 6: 151-175 and here we have the farming sections i've heard so much about... in truth if they're like this every time i can handle it. i like poetic descriptions of the descent of springtime as much as the next annoying girl. DAY 7: 176-200 i am absolutely indulging in vronsky's downfall here. finding pleasure in his every misfortune. his sadness and disappointment spark joy for me. hate that guy. DAY 8: 201-225 well jesus anna! we're only at the 25% mark, we can't act like this already! DAY 10: 226-250 i missed a day. i'm a nightmare person. now i have to see how many pages i can manage in, generously, 20 minutes. perhaps unsurprisingly it took 25 and i'm not caught up. DAY 11: PAGES 251-275 something fun that the universe and i are doing is that we've set up the last three weeks of the year so that i don't only have to finish 24 books, complete two projects, and remain active on seemingly 100 accounts, but i also have the busiest work week(s) i have had in (without exaggeration) 2 years. without the depressive episode that made the last time so fun. anyway i may never catch up on this. DAY 13: PAGES 276-300 guess who's behind. behind again. emma's behind. except she never caught up in the first place so now she's just...50 pages behind instead of 25. or i guess 75 since i haven't actually read any yet today. okay NOW 50. why is this book so good?? DAY 14: PAGES 301-350 well, well, well. look who decided to catch up. biiiiig farming chapters. DAY 15: PAGES 351-375 part four alert. we pray for mercy from agricultural labor bureaucracy content. and our prayers are heard <3 DAY 16: PAGES 376-400 KITTY AND LEVIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! wow i am so invested in this. even dozens of pages about farming and politics can't divest me. i am in it. DAY 17: PAGES 401-425 way, way, way too much is happening. it's the halfway point, people! this is no time for climaxes OR happily ever afters, let alone both! we have 400+ pages to cover! DAY 18: PAGES 426-450 i am uncomfortable with how high stakes everything is. THERE IS SO MUCH LEFT. WHEN I HEFT THIS UNWIELDY VOLUME I AM ONLY AT THE HALFWAY POINT EVEN STILL. I THINK. EVEN THOUGH I'VE BEEN SAYING THAT FOR SEEMINGLY DAYS. DAY 19: 451-475 honestly i care less about the Christian Art than the farming. sheesh. DAY 20: 476-500 it's the circleeee of lifeee... DAY 21: 501-525 what a moral quandary we find ourselves in! DAY 22: 526-550 okay phew, i'm back on board with being obsessed with anna. it makes me uncomfortable to not like a female character who is constantly committing moral wrongs...feels unnatural. part 5 done! DAY 23: 551-575 i'm internally titling this one twenty-five page chunk number 23: the tangled webs we weave. get it together, folks! it's like a sally rooney novel in here. DAY 24: 576-600 this too realistically conveyed the feeling of being clinically annoyed by a friend of a friend. i feel irritable now. DAY 28: 601-650 it's the most wonderful time of the year... read: it's actually december 26, meaning we have actually skipped right to day 28, and i am extremely behind just in time for the end of the year to be right around the corner. but i'm also behind on my other project , and i'm also behind on my actual literal reading challenge, so we're just going to ignore that for today. no time for worrying, only time for reading. actually read 50 pages anyway because i am perfect and infallible. DAY 31: PAGES 651-700 being very brave and reading 50 pages again and also pretending anna isn't on my damn nerves. GIRL STAND UP. we find ourselves heading into part 7. never mind. it's not hard to not be bugged by anna. she's the sh*t. DAY 32: PAGES 701-750 anna is so evil and kitty is so perfect. i love them both. DAY 33: PAGES 751-817 it appears it is time. hello and welcome to the last day of the anna karenina project. oh man. OVERALL not only was i intimidated by this book's length, i was sure i'd find it unconquerable. even as i started it and found it a pleasure, i was waiting for the other shoe to drop. it never did! i enjoyed this every day, through farming and politics and religion and art. readable and sweeping, stunning in its writing and its carrying across effortlessly of both the minutiae and the most important topics of life. it's insane how applicable, how of the moment this book is now, across languages and centuries. read it! i can't believe how long i put it off. rating: 4.5"

        "text":"As part of my reading challenge this year, I wanted to read at least one or two classics, and Anna Karenina was high on my list. It's considered by many to be one of the best novels ever written, and I've never read any Tolstoy. So even though it's a monster at more than 800 pages, I decided it's time I conquered it. The story starts out so strong, with what seems to be an insightful treatise into the family and romantic life of several characters, including title character Anna. The domestic strife, misunderstandings, affairs, and life in general of the Russian elite, when boiled down to its essentials, are not so different from what occupy people's attentions today. I found the initial chapters to be interesting, and was drawn towards the circle of people who would make up the main cast of the book. Then as the story progressed, things started to reach their natural conclusions, until about halfway through the book. At that point, I wish Tolstoy would have stopped because I found the second half to be more or less unnecessary. Everything had been resolved by then. But Tolstoy continued, and for me, the story just fell apart after that. The main characters, in particular Anna, having gotten what they wished for, started acting loony, for lack of a better word. The more their wishes came true, the unhappier they became. A good portion of the second half was devoted to Anna lamenting how her partner does not love her. Every time he goes somewhere, she would pounce on him as soon as he comes home, saying crazy things about how he must be thinking of other women and no longer of her. He would reassure her constantly of his love and unending devotion. She wouldn't listen, so when he inevitably would get frustrated, she took that as confirmation that he doesn't love her. She would leave messages for him not to bother her, and when he doesn't, she would take that as a sign that she is right. This went on for like 200 pages. I wanted to stab myself every time Anna showed up in a scene. It's hard to tolerate a book when you dislike the main character that much. I'm also a little uncomfortable that Tolstoy seems to portray women in his story as weak and mentally unstable, while the men are portrayed as high-thinking orators. The women would fly into tears and rages at the drop of a hat, stirring up domestic trouble while their men are out doing their jobs or hanging out with their buddies. The women also blushed uncontrollably when talking to any man who isn't their husband. Maybe this is just the way it was during Tolstoy's time and this book would have been seen as progressive, but as a modern woman reading it now, it makes me cringe so hard. Tolstoy also seems to have treated this book as a vehicle to get out whatever he wanted to say on a variety of topics, including farming techniques, local governments and elections, the meaning of life, religion, snipe shooting, duty and rights of citizens, etc. This book is full of philosophical musings on these topics and more. I don't mind when authors want to present interesting and tangential thoughts, but Tolstoy did it constantly and without filter. His ramblings would go on for many chapters, and were so unedited that it's essentially a stream of consciousness. I'm sure there are some good points in there, but it's so buried under pages of unreadable and irrelevant prattle that I couldn't find them. While these technical and philosophical ruminations are all throughout the book, they were much worse in the second half, taking up a significant portion of it. Reading this 800+ page tome has been an odyssey. I didn't find any of the characters to be particularly likable or charming. They were all rather silly, unstable, or full of themselves. To me, this is far from one of the best books I've ever read, though it's possible that back then, when there wasn't much to read or do for fun, this would have fulfilled that role. Now I can say I have read Anna Karenina , but that's about as much as I got out of it. ~~~~~~~~~~~~ ✧ Connect with me ✧ Instagram ✧"

        "text":"In the beginning, reading Anna Karenin can feel a little like visiting Paris for the first time. You’ve heard a lot about the place before you go. Much of what you see from the bus you recognize from pictures and movies and books. You can’t help but think of the great writers and artists who have been here before you. You expect to like it. You want to like it. But you don’t want to feel like you have to like it. You worry a little that you won’t. But after a few days, you settle in, and you feel the immensity of the place opening up all around you. You keep having this experience of turning a corner and finding something beautiful that you hadn’t been told to expect or catching sight of something familiar from a surprising angle. You start to trust the abundance of the place, and your anxieties that someone else will have eaten everything up before your arrival relax. (Maybe that simile reveals more about me than I’d like.) My favorite discovery was the three or four chapters (out of the book’s 239) devoted to, of all things, scythe mowing—chapters that become a celebratory meditation on physical labor. When I read those chapters, I felt temporarily cured of the need to have something “happen” and became as absorbed in the reading as the mowers are absorbed in their work. Of course, the book is about Anna and Vronsky and Levin and Kitty and Dolly and poor, stupid Stepan Arkadyich. It’s about their love and courtship and friendship and pride and shame and jealousy and betrayal and forgiveness and about the instable variety of happiness and unhappiness. But it’s also about mowing the grass and arguing politics and hunting and working as a bureaucrat and raising children and dealing politely with tedious company. To put it more accurately, it’s about the way that the human mind—or, as Tolstoy sometimes says, the human soul—engages each of these experiences and tries to understand itself, the world around it, and the other souls that inhabit that world. This book is not afraid to take up any part of human life because it believes that human beings are infinitely interesting and infinitely worthy of compassion. And, what I found stirring, the book’s fearlessness extends to matters of religion. Tolstoy takes his characters seriously enough to acknowledge that they have spiritual lives that are as nuanced and mysterious as their intellectual lives and their romantic lives. I knew to expect this dimension of the book, but I could not have known how encouraging it would be to dwell in it for so long. In the end, this is a book about life, written by a man who is profoundly in love with life. Reading it makes me want to live."

        "text":"This is a book that I was actually dreading reading for quite some time. It was on a list of books that I'd been working my way through and, after seeing the size of it and the fact that 'War And Peace' was voted #1 book to avoid reading, I was reluctant to ever get started. But am I glad that I did. This is a surprisingly fast-moving, interesting and easy to read novel. The last of which I'd of never believed could be true before reading it, but you find yourself instantly engrossed in this kind of Russian soap opera, filled with weird and intriguing characters. The most notable theme is the way society overlooked mens' affairs but frowned on womens', this immediately created a bond between myself and Anna, who is an extremely likeable character. I thought it had an amazing balance of important meaning and light-heartedness. Let's just say, it's given me some courage to maybe one day try out the dreaded 'War And Peace'."

        "text":"WARNING: This is not a strict book review, but rather a meta-review of what reading this book led to in my life. Please avoid reading this if you're looking for an in depth analysis of Anna Karenina . Thanks. I should also mention that there is a big spoiler in here, in case you've remained untouched by cultural osmosis, but you should read my review anyway to save yourself the trouble. I grew up believing, like most of us, that burning books was something Nazis did (though, of course, burning Disco records at Shea stadium was perfectly fine). I believed that burning books was only a couple of steps down from burning people in ovens, or that it was, at least, a step towards holocaust. If I heard the words \"burning books\" or \"book burning,\" I saw Gestapo, SS and SA marching around a mountainous bonfire of books in a menacingly lit square. It's a scary image: an image of censorship, of fear mongering, of mind control -- an image of evil. So I never imagined that I would become a book burner. That all changed the day Anna Karenina, that insufferable, whiny, pathetic, pain in the ass, finally jumped off the platform and killed herself. That summer I was performing in Shakespeare in the Mountains , and I knew I'd have plenty of down time, so it was a perfect summer to read another 1,000 page+ novel. I'd read Count of Monte Cristo one summer when I was working day camps, Les Miserable one summer when I was working at a residential camp, and Shogun in one of my final summers of zero responsibility. A summer shifting back and forth between Marc Antony in Julius Caesar and Pinch, Antonio and the Nun (which I played with great gusto, impersonating Terry Jones in drag) in Comedy of Errors , or sitting at a pub in the mountains while I waited for the matinee to give way to the evening show, seemed an ideal time to blaze through a big meaty classic. I narrowed the field to two by Tolstoy : War and Peace and Anna Karenina . I chose the latter and was very quickly sorry I did. I have never met such an unlikable bunch of bunsholes in my life (m'kay...I admit it...I am applying Mr. Mackey's lesson. You should see how much money I've put in the vulgarity jar this past week). Seriously. I loathed them all and couldn't give a damn about their problems. By the end of the first part I was longing for Anna to kill herself (I'd known the ending since I was a kid, and if you didn't and I spoiled it for you, sorry. But how could you not know before now?). I wanted horrible things to happen to everyone. I wanted Vronsky to die when his horse breaks its back. I wanted everyone else to die of consumption like Nikolai. And then I started thinking of how much fun it would be to rewrite this book with a mad Stalin cleansing the whole bunch of them and sending them to a Gulag (in fact, this book is the ultimate excuse for the October Revolution (though I am not comparing Stalinism to Bolshevism). If I'd lived as a serf amongst this pack of idiots I'd have supported the Bolshies without a second thought). I found the book excruciating, but I was locked in my life long need to finish ANY book I started. It was a compulsion I had never been able to break, and I had the time for it that summer. I spent three months in the presence of powerful and\/or fun Shakespeare plays and contrasted those with a soul suckingly unenjoyable Tolstoy novel, and then I couldn't escape because of my own head. I told myself many things to get through it all: \"I am missing the point,\" \"Something's missing in translation,\" \"I'm in the wrong head space,\" \"I shouldn't have read it while I was living and breathing Shakespeare,\" \"It will get better.\" It never did. Not for me. I hated every m'kaying page. Then near the end of the summer, while I was sitting in the tent a couple of hours from the matinee (I remember it was Comedy of Errors because I was there early to set up the puppet theatre), I finally had the momentary joy of Anna's suicide. Ecstasy! She was gone. And I was almost free. But then I wasn't free because I still had the final part of the novel to read, and I needed to get ready for the show, then after the show I was heading out to claim a campsite for an overnight before coming back for an evening show of Caesar. I was worried I wouldn't have time to finish that day, but I read pages whenever I found a free moment and it was looking good. Come twilight, I was through with the shows and back at camp with Erika and my little cousin Shaina. The fire was innocently crackling, Erika was making hot dogs with Shaina, so I retreated to the tent and pushed through the rest of the book. When it was over, I emerged full of anger and bile and tossed the book onto the picnic table with disgust. I sat in front of the fire, eating my hot dogs and drinking beer, and that's when the fire stopped being innocent. I knew I needed to burn this book. I couldn't do it at first. I had to talk myself into it, and I don't think I could have done it at all if Erika hadn't supported the decision. She'd lived through all of my complaining, though, and knew how much I hated the book (and I am pretty sure she hated listening to my complaints almost as much). So I looked at the book and the fire. I ate marshmallows and spewed my disdain. I sang Beatles songs, then went back to my rage, and finally I just stood up and said \"M'kay it!\" I tossed it into the flames and watched that brick of a book slowly twist and char and begin to float into the night sky. The fire around the book blazed high for a good ten minutes, the first minute of which was colored by the inks of the cover, then it tumbled off its prop log and into the heart of the coals, disappearing forever. I cheered and danced and exorcised that book from my system. I felt better. I was cleansed of my communion with those whiny Russians. And I vowed in that moment to never again allow myself to get locked into a book I couldn't stand; it's still hard, but I have put a few aside. Since the burning of Anna Karenina there have been a few books that have followed it into the flames. Some because I loved them and wanted to give them an appropriate pyre, some because I loathed them and wanted to condemn them to the fire. I don't see Nazis marching around the flames anymore either. I see a clear mountain night, I taste bad wine and hot dogs, I hear wind forty feet up in the tops of the trees, I smell the chemical pong of toxic ink, and I feel the relief of never having to see Anna Karenina on my bookshelf again. Whew. I feel much better now."

        "text":"People are going to have to remember that this is the part of the review that is entirely of my own opinion and what I thought of the book, because what follows isn't entirely positive, but I hope it doesn't throw you off the book entirely and you still give it a chance. Now... my thoughts: I picked up this book upon the advice of Oprah (and her book club) and my friend Kit. They owe me hardcore now. As does Mr. Tolstoy. This book was an extremely long read, not because of it's size and length necessarily, but because of it's content. More often than not I found myself suddenly third a way down the page after my mind wandered off to other thoughts but I kept on reading... am I the only one with the ability to do that? You know, totally zoning out but continuing to read? The subject I passed over though was so thoroughly boring that I didn't bother going back to re-read it... and it didn't affect my understanding of future events taking place later on in the book. Leo Tolstoy really enjoys tangents. Constantly drifting away from the point of the book to go off on three page rants on farming methods, political policies and elections, or philosophical discussion on God. Even the dialogue drifted off in that sort of manner. Tolstoy constantly made detail of trifling matters, while important subjects that added to what little plot line this story had were just passed over. Here is a small passage that is a wonderful example of what constantly takes place throughout the book: \"Kostia, look out! There's a bee! Won't he sting?\" cried Dolly, defending herself from a wasp. \"That's not a bee; that's a wasp!\" said Levin. \"Come, now! Give us your theory,\" demanded Katavasof, evidently provoking Levin to a discussion. \"Why shouldn't private persons have that right?\" No mention of the wasp is made again. Just a small example of how Tolstoy focuses much more on philosophical thought, and thought in general, more than any sort of action that will progress the story further. That's part of the reason the story took so long to get through. The editing and translation of the version I got also wasn't very good. Kit reckons that that's part of the reason I didn't enjoy it as much, and I am apt to agree with her. If you do decide to read this book, your better choice is to go with the Oprah's Book Club edition of Anna Karenina . The characters weren't too great either and I felt only slightly sympathetic for them at certain moments. The women most often were whiny and weak while the men seemed cruel and judgemental more often than not. Even Anna, who was supposedly strong-willed and intelligent would go off on these irrational rants. The women were constantly jealous and the men were always suspicious. There's not much else to say that I haven't already said. There were only certain spots in the book which I enjoyed in the littlest, and even then I can't remember them. All in all I did not enjoy this book, and it earned the names Anna Crapenina and Anna Kareniblah. But remember this is just one girl's opinion, if it sounded like a book you might enjoy I highly advise going out to read it. Just try and get the Oprah edition."

        "text":"I am happy to have discovered this little marvel of deciphering nature and human passions, not in my 'Russian classics' around 20 years ago! At the time, I found significant serenity there, especially with Dostoievski. Today, regarding the question of maturity or only of work, I see something quite different: a magnificent painting of the human condition, both beautiful and tragic, with many ironies and even more finesse in the psychological analysis. In short, it is a masterpiece. As the title suggests, we follow the story of Anna Karenina, the wife of a high Russian dignitary; she is beautiful, healthy, joyful, and radiant until she meets passion, its complications, and its compromises. But, as the title does not indicate, there is also a whole gallery of portraits: her lover Vronsky, sometimes enthusiastic seducer, a sometimes responsible and wise man; her husband Karenina, all confided in his respectability but touched by his sufferings and his dignity; Levine, accurate literary double of Tolstoi according to the notice, the tortured, the pragmatist and the lover; Kitty, the simple, sweet and good woman, after having been a little brainless; the good-natured but well-intentioned parasite Oblonski; and so many others which will take us to the mundane and somewhat idle salons of Saint Petersburg, the revolutionary circles, the district assemblies or deep into the Russian countryside. What is extraordinary (or terrible, depending on which point of view you take) is that you find yourself in the characters and the situations. I am not a 19th-century Russian aristocrat engaged in a passionate affair. Yet I understand her, especially in her paradoxes, constant doubts, inability to stop the spiral of arguments, her interpretations distorted by anxiety, his exaltation, and his absolute love. So much more than the adulterous woman, it is the incarnation of the woman in love: if she had lived today, with the possibilities of divorce and professional activity for women, could she have loved Vronsky? And quietly? I'm not sure. And she will remain a tragic heroine with whom I especially would not like to identify! Although I don't look like the heroine, I am thrilled by my reading, which explains why this review is probably confusing."

        "text":"What is the most important thing about Anna Karenina? Is it the first line, \"Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way\"? This sounds so true but it isn't really. Is it that Anna experiences much more intolerance for her unfaithfulness and leaving her husband than does her brother who screws around like a dog? Is it Konstantin Levin's attempts to marry into the aristocracy and his problem with religion? Or is the entire story just Tolstoy's way of seducing the reader into reading the political nub of the story, the feudalism that was at the heart of all politics, morality and social position. I enjoyed the book when I read it, but I have to say I skimmed over a lot of the politics and did wonder which in Tolstoy's heart is the story he wanted to tell, love stories or political ones? How I came to read Anna Karenina, appendicitis and an air hostess ending with a rotten tomato. I read this book when I was 13. I had a test on it in two days and hadn't even opened it so I said I had stomach ache and went to the school sick room. This was a tall, narrow room with a tiny window about 8' up and painted with shades of olive green and aubergine (eggplant). If you weren't sick going in.. those colours.... But I was away in Russia with Anna, her husband Alexei and Count Vronsky whom I swooned over. In the early hours of the morning, I really had stomach ache. At 4 a.m. I had an emergency appendectomy in a nursing home with an operating theatre. I was very sick indeed and in bed for weeks. Had I brought it on myself? Never mind. Next day three things happened, one bad and one good and one fantastic. My period came on for the first time. I was a Woman! Yes! I told my mother and my grandmother leaned over from the visitor chair and slapped my face very hard, \"That's to take the shock of the blood away.\" She said. Then the good. My mother said I had been waiting for this day and she really let loose at my grandmother. They had a very fierce row. It was wonderful. My mother didn't love me and she never ever defended me or involved herself with me in any way. Memories of being slapped herself I suppose. My mother was very pretty and was the first of her family to be married. On her wedding day, her mother slapped her face as she put the veil on her. \"Ruth should have been married first, not you.\" Ruth was her much less attractive and zealously-religious older sister. (She mellowed). Everyone else in the nursing home was old except for an air hostess of 21. She didn't have a private room and didn't like being with the old people so would wander into mine to sit and read and eat all my chocolates, of which I had endless boxes. She brought her books - Jane Austen, Charlotte Bronte, Mrs. Gaskell and Zola. So for nearly three weeks my days were filled with reading, talking about books with my new friend and eating chocolates all day long. I was actually thrown out of the nursing home. The food there was terrible. One lunchtime there was something forgettable and salad. The tomato was perfect-looking but mushy, almost liquid so I threw it out of the window and it landed on one of the nuns who was beside herself with anger. I didn't care, my friend had left a few days before, left her books for me too in exchange for some fancy ribbon-bowed boxes of chocolates. We wrote for a bit, were penpals, but eventually that died. The age gap and where we were in our lives was too far apart. But I will always remember her and the fabulous books she introduced me too. Thank you Helen. I will never forget Anna Karenina, apart from Tolstoy's political rants and plight of the peasants etc, the book was a pure gold, convoluted love affair. It was like all the best books are, total immersion in another world populated by real people whose lives outside of those described you could easily imagine, not just \"well-drawn characters\". Austen, Bronte, Mrs. Gaskell and Zola were just as good, all of them worlds I lived in when I read their books. Review 1\/2020 Rewritten 15th Jan 2020 to include more about the book."

        "text":"I don’t know where to start...I guess at the beginning. “All happy families resemble one another, but each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.” -Leo Tolstoy Exactly one month ago, scared out of my mind, I opened up this book and read that first line. After that it was all over for me because I was completely HOOKED!!! I had to fight with myself about putting the book down so I could get enough sleep. I brought it with me everywhere in case there was a spare moment when I could escape into its pages. This is one of the most truly remarkable stories I’ve ever read, and I’ve read a great many books!! Going in, I knew that this story would mainly be about two characters, Anna (of course) and Levin. I went in thinking that Anna’s tragical tale of woe would be my preferred point of view. I also knew that there were chapters dedicated to Levin’s agricultural pursuits, and I honestly thought that they would bore me and slow down my reading pace. Oh how wrong past Carolyn was!! The exact opposite happened, Levin’s storyline was the one that captured my heart, as well as his precious love for mowing fields with a scythe. Everytime I read about Levin my heart would melt into a great big puddle. His aspirations for simply wanting to be with the one woman he loves, and living as a humble farmer just made me feel and fall for him all at the same time. Watching his character development from the beginning of the book to the end was incredibly moving and brilliantly written. Reading this story felt like watching a gifted musician compose a grand symphony. Anna, oh my poor Anna! My feelings and sympathies towards her tended to fluctuate while I read. In the beginning, I felt sorrow for her being in a loveless marriage. Then, when love did come walking in, he brought her inevitable fate along with him. I wanted her and Vronsky to be happy together and for them to take pride in their love for eachother. The slow and sad progression of their bond was something that I thought about deeply. Their choices towards the children involved left me feeling quite uneasy. The more I read the more tension I felt coming off the pages. This all culminated in the very prolific “train scene.” Ironically, I read the train scene riding the train myself, on my way back to NYC. As I read about the approaching train, my own train’s wheels were squeaking and the car itself started rocking. I was completely and utterly transported into the story, while being elevated by my own surroundings. I had to stop reading and collect myself because I could feel my face growing red and my eyes start to water. It was a reading experience I will never forget. To read that exact scene on a train myself was indescribable. That’s when I really knew that this book was unlike any other I’ve ever read. I could feel every word, sensation, noise, and breath while reading, not only that scene, but all of them. Anna’s fate although heartbreaking was raw and honest, and I don’t think this book would have remained one of the most profound books ever written if her destiny was changed. Along with our two brilliantly written main characters, the way each character’s story weaved together felt like watching someone hand weave silk threads into a beautiful piece of fabric. Each page felt like a gift that I never wanted to stop opening. The amount of times I read a particular line and was then entirely moved is innumerable. It felt like Tolstoy put his whole heart into each and every line. One of my absolute favorite lines is from the point of view of Levin (of course), “He tried not to look long at her, as if she were the sun, yet he saw her, like the sun, even without looking.” *insert crying noises here* Anne Karenina has become one of (if not) my favorite classics ever. It is tied neck and neck with Jane Eyre for first place, but it is so hard to say. It’s impossible to compare books because each one is different from the other, and that’s what makes this thing called reading so much fun!! I have so much more to say, but I don’t think any configuration of words will ever fully articulate how much I love and adore this book. The fact that this story is over makes me feel quite empty inside, which was half the reason why I practically cried my eye’s out when I read the final page. Yet, the most uplifting aspect of a well written story, is that once the author and their characters make their way inside your heart, there they will remain."

        "text":"\"Leo Tolstoy would meet hatred expressed in violence by love expressed in self-suffering.\" —Mahatma Gandhi Through reading this praiseworthy classic, I have been forced to recalibrate my previously unreliable view of this celebrated author. You see, I was force-fed Tolstoy at college (his writing, not his flesh, silly! Mine wasn't a college for cannibals!) and at the time only carried War and Peace under one arm so I might appear cleverer than I actually was. So, how amazed was I that Anna K has shown me the fun side to Leo T? He is slyly hilarious. How did I not know this? Please note that I haven't read this novel in Russian Cyrillic. I acknowledge that my perception owes a great deal to the amazing interpretive work of the translators, but let's imagine that we in the West have enjoyed his work as the great man intended. The title is something of a misnomer and doesn't do justice to an endearing love story that also captures the disparity between city and country life in 19th-century Russia. For a start, Anna K isn't the star of the show. That billing falls to our anti-hero, Konstantin Dmitrich Levin, a socially awkward, highly intelligent loner who considers himself to be an ugly fellow with no redeemable qualities. Despite being weighed down by all this existential angst, he worships Kitty Shcherbatskaya, an attractive young princess whom he believes to be out of his league. Kitty is described as being \"as easy to find in a crowd as a rose among nettles.\" Tolstoy goes to great lengths to make us understand the inner workings of Levin's mind (For Tolstoy, read Levin: they are one and the same). Levin's love rival, raffishly handsome Count Vronsky, couldn't be more dissimilar. He is socially adept and careful not to offend, whereas Levin could probably start an argument with a goldfish. What a fabulous read this is. Tolstoy's levity and perspicacity shine from every page and the badinage between the main characters is exquisitely observed. He does though have an idiosyncratic way of writing: adjectives are thickly laid on with a trowel and he loves to use repetition to emphasise a point. Anna herself is fascinating, and to affirm just how fascinating she is, Tolstoy employs the word fascinating seven times in one paragraph! Look! I've even started doing it myself! How fascinating! When not beating you about the head with repetition, the Russian master can do majestic descriptive imagery as well as anyone. One simple scene, where Kitty collapses into a low chair, her ball gown rising about her like a cloud, was just perfectly captured. This is a wonderful story of fated love and aristocratic hypocrisy. Tolstoy uses Levin as his political mouthpiece to rail against the ills of late 19th-century Russia, and the author's philosophy of non-violent pacifism also directly influenced none other than Mahatma Gandhi. Anna Karenina is often cited as 'one of the best books ever written'. So who am I to disagree?"

        "text":"Team Levin Anna Karenina is spectacularly well written, with short paragraphs and chapters, that it doesn’t remind me of stuffy writing from 1878. This tome is my second foray into Leo Tolstoy’s work, my first being a short novel, The Death of Ivan Ilych. “Honesty is only a negative qualification,” he said. – Anna Karenina by Leo Tolstoy At the center of this story is Anna Karenina who is a charming, married woman who falls in love with Count Vronsky (definitely not her husband). It also focuses on Dolly and Stepan Oblonsky as well as Kitty and Levin. This book is written in such a style where you can “hear” the characters’ thoughts, and it highlighted the difference in how men and women are treated in society. And if it was just the romance and societal tension, I would have rated this book 5 stars. However, there was a lot of commentary about peasants and religion. As I am not an expert in Russian history\/politics of 1878, this part was a bit over my head. I felt like I needed a wise sage to guide me through these parts. This book is interesting enough and worthy of a reread, but I would have to rope in a person a bit wiser than myself to help me along.

        "text":"Not since I read The Brothers Karamazov have I felt as directly involved in characters' worlds and minds. Fascinating. I was hooked on Anna Karenina from the opening section when I realized that Tolstoy was brilliantly portraying characters' thoughts and motivations in all of their contradictory, complex truth. However, Tolstoy's skill is not just in characterization--though he is the master of that art. His prose invokes such passion. There were parts of the book that took my breath because I realized that what I was reading was pure feeling: when we realize that Anna is no longer pushing Vronsky away, when Levin proposes to Kitty, and later when Levin thinks about death. The book effectively threw a shroud over me and sucked me in--I almost missed my train stop a couple of times. That being said, there were some parts that were difficult to get through. I felt myself slowing down in Part VI. I was back in through the remainder of the book once I hit Part VII, but I understand how the deep dive into politics and farming can be off-putting. Still, in those chapters Tolstoy's characters are interacting, and it's incredible to see them speak and respond to one another. It's not only worth the trouble, but deep down, it's no trouble at all. It's to be savored, and sometimes we must be forced to slow down and think about the characters' daily life as they navigate around in their relationships. A word about this translation. When I was in college I attempted to read the Constance Garnett translation. I didn't stop because it was awful (I think finals came up, then the holidays, then more classes, etc.). However, I never really felt like the words were as powerful as they should have been. Years later, the only image that stuck in my mind was of Levin meeting Kitty at the ice skating rink. I just never really entered the world of Anna Karenina , perhaps my fault more than anything. However, the diction and sentence construction in Pevear and Volokhonsky's translation is poetic and justifies the title \"masterpiece.\" Through this translation I grew to appreciate Tolstoy not just because he told good, philosophical stories, but because he could do so with utmost subtletly and compactness--yes, I think Tolstoy is concise. Each word has its place. Understandably, many are unwilling to give themselves to this book. Many expect it to do all of the work. But it's an even better read because if the reader works, the experience of reading this book is incredible."

        "text":"Tolstoy draws a portrait of three marriages or relationships that could not be more different. Anna Karenina is rightly called a masterpiece. Moreover Tolstoy does not spare on social socialism and describes the beginnings of communism, deals with such existential themes as birth and death and the meaning of life. Tolstoy’s narrative art and his narrative charm are at the highest level. He also seems like a close observer of human passions, feelings and emotions. All in all I was touched by his book because it was one of the most impressive books I have ever read. \"Kendi yüceliğinin yüksekliğinden bana bakmasına bayılıyorum\".

        "text":"As someone who loves classic literature, Anna Karenina is probably the most substantial novel I’ve ever read - 1 of Leo Tolstoy ’s 3 monumental masterpieces. Despite the title, Anna actually is not the sole protagonist. The novel follows 2 main storylines: 1 centered on Anna, the other on Levin. Through the people around them - their relationships, emotions, and choices - Tolstoy paints a vivid and profound portrait of 19th-century Russian aristocratic life. The story revolves around love and marriage: Anna and her husband Alexei, Anna and Vronsky, Levin and Kitty, Stiva and Dolly. Through Levin’s evolving thoughts, Tolstoy explores his views on life, love, society, and the kind of family life he admires. These characters’ lives are intricately woven together, reflecting the complexities of a class on the brink of decline. Potential Spoilers Ahead! Anna is portrayed as nearly perfect - beautiful, graceful, intelligent, cultured, and morally upright. Even judged by aristocratic standards, she’s exceptional. If not for the emotional void that Vronsky awakens in her, she would’ve been universally admired. Tolstoy never diminishes her outward elegance, even when her soul is falling apart. She’s not someone to condemn - she’s a tragic figure who evokes deep sympathy and frustration, which we end up projecting onto the people and society around her. She’s no longer young, a devoted mother to her 8-year-old son, with a refined taste in art and literature. She’s charming, magnetic in social settings, and even Levin - newly married - finds himself drawn to her. Morally, she’s compassionate and kind, caring for a suicidal worker, her sister-in-law, and her nieces and nephews. Even other women, despite their jealousy, can’t bring themselves to dislike her. But all of this unravels with a single glance from Vronsky on a train. Her emotional world begins to crack, and her suppressed desires explode. Her pain stems from her husband’s coldness and hypocrisy. On the surface, her marriage looks ideal - Alexei is powerful and successful. But he’s obsessed with status and work, neglecting Anna entirely. Their relationship is polite but hollow. Anna sees him as a well-oiled machine - efficient, respectable, but soulless. He provides everything materially, but emotionally, he drains her. A woman is like a flower, needs emotional nourishment. Without it, she either wilts like a rose or grows wild like a poppy - beautiful but poisonous. And what about Vronsky? He’s not a villain. He falls for Anna’s beauty and gives up everything for her - his career, his reputation, even his family. He’s talented, generous, admired, and artistic. He’s like a proud, graceful stallion, loved by all. But like someone enchanted by a poppy’s beauty and addicted to its poison, he loses himself in Anna. He tries to build a life with her, even attempts suicide twice. Yet people still blame him for the tragedy. Alexei, Anna’s husband, isn’t entirely blameless either. He’s emotionally detached, and when he discovers Anna’s affair, he becomes even colder, refusing to divorce her and trapping everyone - Anna, Vronsky, their son - in a moral cage. He’s incapable of love, but he does experience deep pain. At 1 point, he even shows compassion for Anna’s child with Vronsky. In a way, his life is destroyed too. Anna and Vronsky face not just social judgment but internal torment. Anna knows her overwhelming emotional needs are consuming her. She tries to break things off after giving birth to their daughter, clinging to her son as her last anchor. But after reconnecting with Vronsky, she spirals into obsession. Her love becomes insatiable - like a poppy needing endless sun and water. Even their child becomes a source of resentment. Not even Italy’s beauty and art can soothe her. Her melancholy and emotional hunger become a burden for Vronsky. They drain each other, unable to stop. Their dream of love lasts less than a year. They return to aristocratic society, and Vronsky tries to build a new life, hoping marriage will fix things. But Anna’s paranoia and emotional intensity make that impossible. Their final fight ends with Anna’s suicide. Vronsky, shattered, heads to the front lines. Thankfully, there’s Levin. He’s Tolstoy ’s semi-autobiographical character, and he brings warmth and depth to the novel. If Anna’s story gives the book its tragic weight, Levin’s journey elevates it to something truly profound. Levin is ordinary - no dramatic highs or lows. He’s not cynical like his brother Nikolai, nor brilliant like Sergei. He’s awkward, skeptical of aristocratic games, uninterested in politics, and doubtful of religion. He’s more like a humble landowner than a nobleman. He cares about his farm and his workers, joins them in labor, and wants to improve their lives. But even his efforts fail. His intellectual pursuits stall after marriage, and he’s often overwhelmed by life’s demands. He’s not young or charming. He’s rejected by Kitty, crushed emotionally, and retreats into hard labor to cope. He’s shy, naive, and clueless about love and marriage. Even after marrying Kitty, he doubts his happiness. He’s unprepared for everything - wedding plans, pregnancy, childbirth. Without Kitty’s support, his life would be chaos. He never reforms his estate or finishes his book. His only success is marrying Kitty, but even that joy is quickly replaced by everyday struggles. The novel ends here, almost abruptly. Anna and Vronsky’s story has closure, but Levin’s doesn’t. He’s still searching, still thinking, and his final realization doesn’t offer a clear philosophical answer. But maybe that’s the point. Levin’s ordinariness makes the novel extraordinary. He’s relatable, real. We can step into his shoes, feel his emotions, and follow his evolving thoughts. He doesn’t chase greatness, but he works hard. He doesn’t envy status, but he builds genuine friendships. He’s not wealthy, but he’s happy. He’s simple, but thoughtful. He avoids flashy clubs and enjoys honest labor. He’s timid in love, but wins Kitty’s heart. Everyone around him - Stiva, Dolly, Nikolai, Sergei, Anna, Vronsky - finds comfort or connection in Levin. Even with his flaws, people love him. He lacks the typical aristocratic traits, but he embodies the virtues that truly matter. Tolstoy uses Levin to show that the qualities society often overlooks - honesty, humility, kindness - are the ones that lead to real happiness. The aristocrats seem enviable, but their misery is painfully real. Through Levin, Tolstoy critiques both the old nobility and modern capitalist values that chase wealth, status, and pleasure at the cost of morality, happiness, and human connection. Levin’s fear of death after Nikolai’s passing leads him to existential despair. He feels like a fleeting bubble in the vast universe. Science and philosophy fail to comfort him. In the end, he turns to the religion he once abandoned. Though disproven by science, faith gives him meaning - more than any theory ever could. So if philosophy is the highest peak of the rational world, then in the emotional world, nothing stands taller than love. Love is this blazing, sincere, selfless feeling that cuts straight to the heart. It’s pure and precious - often overwhelming, yet hard to put into words. It’s like the “Zen” in a monk’s heart - only truly understood through experience, passed from soul to soul. Funny thing is, those people who talk about love the most are often the ones who’ve never truly experienced it. These so-called “experts” end up describing something that’s not love at all - more like a messy mix of lust, desire, ethics, money, logic, and analysis. It’s like a stir-fry of everything but the real thing. And when love loses its true face, it becomes hard to swallow. So yeah, I know this piece I’m writing is probably flawed and flimsy, but I’m still putting it out there - call it a bit of dreamy rambling. Love, marriage, and family - they’re not the same thing. Love is deeply personal. It’s emotional, not rational. It’s free, untamed, and rooted in human nature. You can suppress it, but you can’t train it. That’s why Anna and Vronsky’s love hits so hard. It’s fiery and unstoppable. Anna gives up her family and even her life for love. Vronsky gives up his future and goes against high society for it. Real love is like that - it defies social judgment, breaks through chaos, ignores rules and expectations. It crosses cities and countrysides just to say, “I love you.” True love doesn’t care about ethics or moral codes. In rejecting those, it stays true to the human heart and protects the purity and freedom love deserves. Marriage and family, though? Totally different. Marriage is more like a social contract between 2 people. Family brings in material concerns. Unlike love, which is emotional and personal, marriage and family are social and rational. That’s why they’re bound by ethics and norms - they’re about stability, not passion. Take Oblonsky and Dolly, for example. Their marriage revolves around property, income, kids, chores. Romance fades, passion wears down, but what matters is that Oblonsky comes back after cheating, and Dolly stays after her rage. What matters is compromise, realism, and responsibility. Sadly, we often confuse love with marriage - like 1 must lead to the other, or that marriage must be built on love. But their very nature hints at a deep conflict: individual vs. society, freedom vs. rules, emotion vs. reason. When these collide, tragedy often follows. That conflict is clearest in Anna and Vronsky’s story. Anna, a married woman, falls for Vronsky. What could’ve been a fleeting affair turns into a full-blown relationship - living together, a difficult childbirth, a child out of wedlock. They openly challenge Anna’s marriage, society’s moral boundaries, and every social norm. And why? Because they love each other deeply and want to build a life together. Their love becomes a clash between human emotion and societal rules. That clash proves impossible to resolve. Anna, crushed by social rejection and Vronsky’s growing coldness, chooses to end her life. Vronsky, heartbroken, heads to the battlefield. Even if love ultimately loses to societal pressure, does that mean their love wasn’t real? Can we really sit on our moral high horses and judge people who stood on the peak of human emotion? Honestly, anyone with a shred of humanity would struggle to make such a cold judgment. Anna and Vronsky’s love was genuine. It had nothing to do with marriage or being a “third party.” I think anyone who meets their own “Anna” or “Vronsky” would feel their heart skip a beat. The difference is, some act on it - like Anna and Vronsky - and some bury it deep inside, like those of us clinging to moral superiority. So no, their love isn’t something to condemn. The real issue is that they tried to turn that love into a marriage, into a family. That’s where society steps in, and judgment begins. That’s the tragedy. Compare that to Levin and Kitty’s relationship - it’s a quieter kind of conflict. Their love is clearly aimed at marriage. Tolstoy doesn’t dwell much on their romance - it basically starts with Levin’s proposal. Their wedding, though, is one of the novel’s most beautiful moments, and their ending is sweet and enviable. But it makes me wonder, right: was Levin’s love real? Did he marry because he loved Kitty, or did he love her because he wanted to marry? Levin’s attention shifts between 3 sisters - first the eldest, then the second, and finally Kitty. So it’s fair to question whether he truly loved her. It feels like he designed a family first, then picked someone to fill the role. His goal was so clear, it almost seems like he loved himself more than anyone else. He wanted a companion, and mistook that for love. That’s what sets him apart from Vronsky. Levin is steady and romantic, but he never experiences the kind of all-consuming passion Vronsky does. And that passion - that overwhelming, selfless love - is what makes great love so unforgettable. Still, Levin and Vronsky are alike in one way: they both mix love with marriage and family. Levin loses true love for the sake of marriage. Vronsky loses marriage because of true love. In that sense, both are tragic. I often imagine - what if Anna and Vronsky had stopped at mutual attraction, or just one magical night? Maybe then their love would’ve stayed pure, untouched by the weight of expectations. Maybe that first meeting at the train station would’ve been their most cherished memory. Or what if they had escaped judgment and married like Levin and Kitty? Would they, years later, end up like Oblonsky and Dolly - romance gone, stuck in routine? Love is beautiful because it’s pure. But that purity makes it fragile. Even the most passionate love can’t survive the grind of daily life, let alone the crushing weight of moral expectations. The most heartbreaking moment in the novel isn’t Anna’s final leap - it’s Vronsky trying to remember their happiest times, only to feel those memories poisoned forever. Maybe love should just be love. Not about marriage. Not about family. Not about possession or permanence. Maybe it’s the distance between us and the stars that makes them eternal. 5 \/ 5 stars (Really sorry - I think I rambled on for way too long. But that’s what happens when the book I’m reading is that good)."

        "text":"A few months ago I read Anna in the Tropics, a Pulitzer winning drama by Nilo Cruz. Set in 1920s Florida, a lector arrives at a cigar factory to read daily installments of Anna Karenina to the workers there. Although the play takes place in summer, the characters enjoyed their journey to Russia as they were captivated by the story. Even though it is approaching summer where I live as well, I decided to embark on my own journey through Leo Tolstoy's classic nineteenth century classic novel. Although titled Anna Karenina after one of the novel's principle characters, this long classic is considered Tolstoy's first 'real' novel and his take on a modernizing country and on people's lives within it. The novel begins as Anna Karenina arrives in Moscow from Petersburg to help her brother and sister-in-law settle a domestic dispute. Members of Russia's privileged class, Darya \"Dolly\" Alexandrovna discovers that her husband Stepan Arkadyich \"Stiva\" Oblonsky has engaged in an affair with one of their maids. Affairs being a long unspoken of part of upper class life, Dolly desires to leave her husband along with their five children. Anna pleads with Dolly to reconcile, and the couple live a long, if not tenuous, marriage, overlooking each other's glaring faults. While settling her brother's marriage, Anna is reminded of her own unhappy marriage, setting the stage for a drama that lasts the duration of the novel. Tolstoy sets the novel in eight parts and short chapters with three main story lines, allowing for his readers to move quickly through the plot. In addition to Stiva and Dolly, Tolstoy introduces in part one Dolly's sister Kitty Shcherbatsky, a young woman of marriageable age who is forced to choose between Count Vronsky and Konstantin Dmitrich Levin. At a ball in Kitty's honor, Vronsky is smitten with Anna, temporarily breaking Kitty's heart. Even though Levin loves Kitty with his whole heart, Kitty refuses his offer in favor of Vronsky, and falls into a deep depression. Levin, seeing the one love of his life reject him, vows to never marry. Anna becomes a fallen woman and rejects her husband in favor of Vronsky, fathering his child, leaving behind the son she loves. Even those closest to her, including family members, are appalled. A G-D fearing woman in a religious society is supposed to view marriage as sacred. Yet, Anna does not value her loved ones' advice and chooses to live with Vronsky. Despite a comfortable, upper class life, Anna is in constant internal turmoil. Spurned by a society that clings to its institutions as marriage and the church, Anna chooses love yet isolation from all but Vronsky and their daughter. Her ex-husband is viewed as a strict adherent to the law, cold, and unsympathetic, and will not grant a divorce. Even though Anna is clearly in the wrong, Tolstoy has his readers sympathizing with her situation, rooting for a positive outcome. He brings to light the plight of lack of women's rights, especially in regard to divorce, and has one hoping that Russia changes her ways as she modernizes. If Anna's situation sheds light on the worst of Russian society and Dolly's reveals its stagnation, then Kitty, who later marries Levin, shows how the country begins to modernize. Kostya and Kitty marry for love, rather than gains in society. Believed by many to be Tolstoy's alter ego, Levin is an estate farmer who is well aware of the rights of his tenant farmers called muzhiks. Along with his brother Sergei Ivanovich, Levin works toward agrarian reform. Both men, Sergei Ivanovich especially, is swept up in the communist ideals that are beginning to form, in rejection of the tsarist governing of the country. Tolstoy diverges pages at a time to farming reforms and one can see in these pages his own beliefs for the future of Russia in the late 19th century. Through the three principle couples: Stiva and Dolly, Vronsky and Anna, and Levin and Kitty, Tolstoy presents the old, changing, and new Russia. Having Levin introduce farming mechanisms from the west and Vronsky participate in a Slavic war, Tolstoy presents a Russia that is no longer completely isolated. He reveals how communism begins to shape up as farmers are no longer happy as tenants and many privileged classes adhere to newer values. Meanwhile, through Dolly, Anna, and Kitty, Tolstoy also presents how a woman's role in this society changes, including schooling and her place in a marriage. As the twentieth century nears, Russian life is no longer set in antiquated ways. Had I not read a drama set in the tropics, I most likely would not have journeyed to 19th century Russia. I enjoyed learning about Leo Tolstoy's views on life there and how he saw late 19th century Russia as a changing society. I found the plight his title character depressing while reading about Levin and Kitty to be uplifting as Russia moves toward the future. Tolstoy's words are accessible in spite of the novel's length, a testament to the stellar translation done by Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky. A true classic, I enjoyed my time with the characters in Anna Karenina, and rate Tolstoy's premier novel 5 shining stars."

        "text":"Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way. This opening sentence sums up the main theme of this great work: family relationships. Tolstoy has chosen three families to work on the different aspects of this theme. The first family is that of Anna and the second family is that of Levin and Kitty. The third and a little less prominent than the other two is the family of Dolly and Stepan. Anna's story, for which the book is well known and loved, occupies a greater part of the book. Anna is young. Having married a man nearly twenty years elder to her at a very young age, Anna is not exposed to the feelings of love and passion a woman would feel for a man. Alexey, an ambitious man who treats her wife to every material comfort, fails to give Anna the care, attention, and love which she needed. Anna's later reference to her husband as \"he is not a man but a machine...\" shows how unfeeling he has been towards her. The comforter and saviour of her life was his son, Seryozha, for whom she had devoted her life while being a dutiful wife. But the fateful meeting with Count Vronsky changes her path of life. Anna's realization of what is missing in her life coupled with the newborn feelings of love and passion for Vronsky takes her through a destructive and tragic path. The widespread view on Anna's story is that of a woman's infidelity in carrying out an adulterous affair. While this view is correct, there is more to it than that of mere adultery. The relationship between the threesome is complex. Anna is bound by duty and honour to her husband while she passionately loves Vronsky. She is torn between wronging her husband and her desire to live happily with the man she loves. Moreover, Anna is worried about the consequences that her action would have on her relationship with her precious son. Her son and Vronsky are the love of her life but one excludes the other. For this reason, she refuses a divorce thus willingly demoting her to a humiliating position by living as an \"immoral woman\" in the eyes of the society. Her self-sacrifice of character simply to retain her relationship with her son is to be admired and pitied. And though at times, Anna was infuriating, the story is written in such a way that it was difficult to blame her. This is why Anna has become a tragic heroine. Vronsky and Alexey (either could be seen as the villain in this tragic story according to the personal views of the reader) on the other hand are both victims in their own right. Both are to be sympathized, perhaps Vronsky a little more than Alexey, as he gave up all his life ambitions for his love for Anna. In contrast to Anna's tragic story, a \"happy\" conventional family is provided by Levin and Kitty. Despite the differences of character, temperament, views, and beliefs Levin and Kitty manage to carry on a successful and loving marriage. The family relationship between Levin and Kitty is modeled on Tolstoy's own convictions on marriage. The relationship between Dolly and Stepan comes between these two extremes. In the light of Stepan's infidelity and his expensive way of living, Dolly and her children suffer considerably. Dolly would like to walk out of the marriage. But her children, convention, and her religious beliefs all contribute to her indecision on the course of action. A vain belief that her husband's conduct is not \"infidelity of the heart\" keeps her going on with her \"sham\" marriage. The book consists of two separate yet interconnected plots: One is the plot woven around Anna and the other is the plot woven around Levin. Former, with its complex emotions, social conventions coupled with women's position legally and socially, provides for the excitement and life of the entire work. The latter, more or less modeled on Tolstoy's life, provides for the political, philosophical, social, and religious views of the author as well as an insight into the author's life struggles. I liked both plots. Each has complemented the other to produce a complete work in every sense. And the characters which were modeled by Tolstoy's observance of the society were felt real. There were no characters that one could call artificial. Above all what is most striking is the beautiful writing of Tolstoy. His use of metaphors is very clever and marvelous. Reading the book was like eating a rich and thick layered piece of cake. No matter how many layers are peeled, its taste does not diminish. Words would not do justice to say how much I loved this work. It is one brilliant and marvelous piece of work. A work can be a great classic, but to become a masterpiece, the author has to steer it above common ground. And Tolstoy has achieved this end quite brilliantly.

        "text":"Alright, I'm going to do my best not to put any spoilers out here, but it will be kind of tough with this book. I should probably start by saying that this book was possibly the best thing I have ever read. It was my first Tolstoy to read, and the defining thing that separated what he wrote from anything else that I've read is his characters. His characters are unbelievably complex. The edition of this book that I read was over 900 pages, so he has some time to do it. His characters aren't static, but neither are they in some kind of transition from A to B throughout the book. They are each inconsistent in strikingly real ways. They think things and then change their minds. They believe something and then lose faith in it. Their opinions of each other are always swirling. They attempt to act in ways that align with something they want, but they must revert back to who they are. But who a character is is a function of many things, some innate and some external and some whimsical and moody. So all the characters seem too complex to be characters in a book. It's as if no one could write a character that could be so contradictory and incoherent and still make them believable, so no one would try to write a character like Anna Karenina. But people are that complex, and they are incoherent and that's what makes Tolstoy's characters so real. Their understandings of each other and themselves are as incoherent as mine of those around me and myself. One of the ways that Tolstoy achieves this is through incredible detail to non-verbal communication. He is always describing the characters movements, expressions, or postures in such a way that you subtly learn their thoughts. He does an amazing job in the internal monologues the characters experience. You frequently hear a character reason with himself and reveal his thoughts or who he is to you in some way, and all the while you feel like you already knew that they felt that or were that. Even as the characters are inconsistent. There are times when he can describe actions that have major implications on the plot with blunt and simple words and it still felt rich because the characters are so full. The book takes on love, marriage, adultery, faith, selfishness, death, desire\/attraction, happiness. It also speaks interestingly on social classes or classism. He also addresses the clash between the pursuit of individual desires and social obligations\/restraints. There is just so much to wrestle with here. And you go through a myriad set of emotions and impressions of the characters as you read. At times you can love or hate or adore a character. You can be ashamed of or ashamed for or reviled by or anxious with or surprised by a character. And you feel this way about each of them at points. But it isn't at all a roller coaster ride of emotion. It's fluid and natural and makes sense. One of the many points that the book seemed to reach to me was the strength and power of love. Tolstoy displays it in all its power and all its inability. In the end love is not sufficient enough to sustain. He writes tremendous triumphs for it, and then he writes the months after when the reality of human failings set in. But love is good, and there is hope. Life can be better with love in it. Should I have kids one day I think I'll make reading this book a precondition for them to start dating (that and turning 25). I was also surprised by a section towards the end of the book where Tolstoy through Levin, my favorite character and the one that I identified with the most, makes a case for Christianity that was so simple but at the same time really impacted me. I guess I'll leave that alone here. Basically, I don't have high enough praise for this book. I hope everyone reads it. It is very long, and I found the third quarter or so slow. But I could definitely read it again. Not soon but it could become a must read every 15 years or so for me. Between he nature of the content and the quality of the words, I would say that this is the greatest masterpiece in words that I've ever found."

        "text":"Levin (which is what the title should be, since he is the main character, the real hero and the focus of the book!) (But who would read the book with that title, I know!) If you don't want to know the ending, don't read this review, though I won't actually talk about what happens to Anna specifically, something I knew 40 years ago without even reading the book. I didn't read the book to find out what happens to her. I knew that. Probably many of you know or knew the ending before reading the book. And this isn't so much a review as a personal reflection. I was tempted, finally, after decades of NOT reading it, to now, approaching my 60th birthday, finish it, all 818 pages, tempted to just simply write: Pretty good! :) But I resist that impulse, sorry (because now, if you so choose to read on, you will have to read many more than those two words. . .). This is as millions of people have observed over the past 140 years, a really great book, and those of you who are skeptical of reading \"Great Books\" or \"classics\" may still not be convinced, but this has in my opinion a deserved reputation of one of the great works of all time, and one of the reasons it IS so good is because it speaks humbly and eloquently against pomposity and perceived or received notions of \"greatness.\" Why do I care about its place in the canon? I guess I really don't. I just think some books deserve the rep they get from the literary establishment, and some deserve the rep they get from the wider reading public. This one is a great literary accomplishment AND a great read, in my opinion, and deserves to be read and read widely by more than just the English major club. And I say this as one who prefers Dostoevsky to Tolstoy; I seem to prefer stories of anguish and doubt to stories of affirmation and faith, and the atheist\/agnostic literary club I belong to is maybe always going to favor doubt and anguish over faith and hope and happiness. But to make clear: This surely is a book of faith, of family, of affirmation, of belief in the land, nature, goodness, and simple human joys over the life of \"society\" with all of its pretension. Yes, all that affirmation is true of the book in spite of what happens to Anna. I write this in particular contexts, as we all do when we read and write. If I had read this book in my more cynical early twenties, when I actually started it once (and again a few times over my life time and never finished), when I had no kids, I might not have liked it much. If I had read this right after Crime and Punishment and The Brothers Karamazov, or in the years I was first reading Under the Volcano, Kafka, Camus, what I think of as my existentialist years, I might have found it too. . . life-affirming. But today I have kids, and as seemed to have happened with Chris Ware, as evidenced by his more positive Building Stories, having kids changed everything for me, and in a good way. In harsh times, you need stories of hope and goodness, and Levin's story is a timeless story of hope and goodness. Another context: I am particularly shaken as I write this by the 20 kids dead in a Connecticut elementary school in Sandy Hook yesterday, with, too, a good teacher, principal, and school psychologist and others who have given their lives to doing good for children, senselessly slaughtered. This is a murderous country, the most murderous in the world, killings devastating my Chicago on a daily basis maybe especially this year, but every damned year. And despair\/suicide is possibly more prevalent than ever. Maybe it is time for a bit of reordering priorities toward goodness, and finishing this book as my news feeds gave me updates on the tragedy provides an interesting contrast in experiences, rendering different but altogether persuasive truths about the nature of the world. Tolstoy was himself, the translator Richard Pevear writes in his fine, brief introduction, in some sense writing a response to the nihilists who were as he saw it in fashion in late nineteenth century Russia, in Moscow, in Europe, in the world. Tolstoy was himself searching for meaning in life and struggling with faith and beliefs in a way he didn't ever struggle about again (or as much) after this book, and the struggle makes for the greatness, in my opinion. His late book Resurrection, by contrast, has none of the struggle about faith that this book has in it. It's mostly a binary world, all Good and Evil, a didactic allegory. Pevear says one of the two main characters, Levin, the country farmer struggling to also write his ideas about farming, is the most fully realized self-portrait that Tolstoy created, and he is on the main pretty delightful. Grumpy at times, stubborn, moody and not witty, a kind of no-nonsense traditionalist I certainly would have been annoyed at regularly if I knew him, Levin is often a kind of comical character, self-deprecatingly clueless as he approaches the Big Events of his life: His brother's death, his proposal to Kitty, the birth of his first child. These are also moments of real angst\/anguish and passion and comedy\/tragedy, written with great flourish and amazing detail, great sections of the book, pretty thrilling to read, in my opinion. These are, Tolstoy tells us, in the main what life (and literature) is and should be mainly about, love and death, and they deserve loving attention for us, as are also the striving for goodness and faith. The current art scene of the time, in especially Moscow's theater and art and literature scenes, the world of fashion, the culture of massive-debt-incurring spending on a lavish lifestyle, all this Tolstoy skewers through the comical eyes of the simple farmer Levin, who at his best is so attached to the land, to family, to love, to good talk, and good friendship. But he is not a stereotype, he is a great character, fully realized. And what can we say of Anna, the other main character, his sort of opposite? Well, if you want to look for what is in some sense a \"moral\" of this huge tome of a book, this might be it: “If you look for perfection, you'll never be content.” Or, if you want to be happy you will want to make choices that Levin makes instead of Anna's tragic choices--but Anna, in having been originally intended by Tolstoy (thanks to Pevear here for his introduction) as an immoral woman, a woman corrupted by city values, is never really only that, any more than Levin can be seen as a holy man. Tolstoy is creating literature here, not a didactic tract, and we see all along that Tolstoy falls in love with Anna as she emerges through his creation of her in his novel, and she is thus for him and us real and fascinating, a human being, and a wondrous one in many ways, one of the great women of literature, without question. You don't have to agree with her choices or like her, but she will come to life for you as few characters ever will. And many of you will fall in love with her as Tolstoy did. As I did, I'll admit. There's one time Tolstoy has his two main characters meet, and this is a great evening, where the simple Levin actually is obviously attracted to Anna in so many ways, and not just the physical attraction all men and women seem to have for her. Levin, like Tolstoy, sees that Anna is vital, viscerally alive, she's fascinating, interesting; okay, she IS a romantic heroine, but she is a romantic heroine that anyone reading romances should read. The women of Wuthering Heights, Jane Eyre, Anna Karenina, Madame Bovary, these are \"romances\" but they are all so much more, that sweep you into the world in richer and deeper ways. Anna Karenina is, like War and Peace, like The Brothers Karamazov, a rich cultural forum, a series of linked meditations on farming and politics and religion and family and relationships and war and the meaning of life, not just about sex and romance. You get so much out of it, as it is all about reflecting on and teaching you how the mundane aspects of our lives are worth paying attention to (I know the bulk of readers absolutely hate the farming and politics sections of the book, but I would contend it is all relevant to Tolstoy's webbed narrative reflection on the meaning of life). And Anna, in the very center of this tale, as a kind of twin contrast to Levin, but not a simple one (they are both suicidal at times; they both are moody and struggle and are essentially lonely for much of the book), is one shimmering, tragic character we can't simply dismiss for submitting to and crushing her life (as she does) through lust for Vronsky. We come to understand her well, we come to understand why she does what she does and why we must pity her and even support her, love her. I know a lot of people have not come to this position about her, they dismiss her as a shallow twit who throws her life away for an also shallow, callous dashing fellow, but in the end we even come to like Vronsky and pity him, and admire his resilience. He IS also an attractive character, in many ways, in spite of his shallow aspects. And maybe we are even sympathetic for them in this forbidden, unwise love. I know I am. We care for them. Of the other main characters, I liked Kitty, Levin's wife (who deals with the dying of her husband's brother so deftly as opposed to her clueless husband) a lot, and who becomes attracted to Vronsky too in a way as so may women seem to do. Levin's two brothers are both great, and provide the basis for rich conversations. The Dolly\/Oblonsky pair are yet another view of a married relationship. I even like the portrait of the sad, stiff Karenin, the diplomat we can see is a good man, certainly not a great lover for Anna, but we see his struggles and come to feel sorry for him, I think. He's not an ideal match for the passionate Anna, maybe, but he's a good and essentially blameless man. I like all the minor characters we get to meet, too, the people Tolstoy finds more genuine than all the upper crust he mocks and derides and, you know, also cares about. This is a great book, my friends, with some great characters and great scenes. And now to the movie? I read one blurb that said without Tolstoy's gorgeous writing, any movie version of Anna Karenina will only be a soap opera, and that is what I feared. . . and that is what I found in seeing it. The movie couldn't begin to capture Tolstoy's reflections on life and love and birth and death. It was a melodrama, a good one but not great or rich as the novel. And what do English readers miss, as my friends who read Russian and have grown up reading his prose IN Russia say? That his use of the Russian language is unparalleled, gorgeous, breathtaking. Well, I don't know the language in which Tolstoy wrote, but this translation of his tale is pretty amazing, I think. But in any language, read it, my friends. PS I have also recently read Madame Bovary, which I also liked in spite of the main character's (also) bad choices. I liked Anna K even more, though."

        "text":"\"I think... if it is true that there are as many minds as there are heads, then there are as many kinds of love as there are hearts.\" ― Leo Tolstoy, Anna Karenina As I drew back the cover and stepped into the world of the Russian aristocracy, I found myself entranced by the excess and proper etiquette. A realm of high society so foreign, so inviting, that I couldn’t turn away. My eyes devoured Tolstoy’s delicious words like the sweetest candy. The characters called me in, seating me in the front row where I would have the best view. The book became an electric moment in time as their stories bewitched me. I urged Levin not to give up on love. I watched on in disbelief as a perfectly beautiful Anna was overcome with a passion that turned her into someone she no longer knew. I was dumbfounded at how Vronsky, a man filled with selfish desire, could so easily tear apart everyone who came near him and soldier on as if it were merely another day. These three were only a tiny portion of the troupe that would dominate my mind as I became wrapped up in their fates as if they were my own.. Love and pain, two such opposite emotions, yet intricately tied to one another. These were the driving forces behind this fantastic tale. It was a study of connections and intense passions, that ran the gamut from husband and wife to the affection that a man has for his country. In the end, the weight was almost unbearable for each that leapt. No matter which kind of love, there is always a price, and they had to be willing to pay it. Very soon after I started this book, I knew the tracks would no longer be there for many of my favorite characters and that I would plunge into the abyss along with them if I didn’t get off at the next stop. I couldn’t leave them. I needed to be a part of their world even if it ended badly. As much affection as this story gave, it equally took back in tears and heartbreak. The story is brilliant, and I could never do it justice here. If you haven’t read Anna Karenina I urge you to put aside the fact that it is a very lengthy novel and take it up. I am forever changed."

        "text":"Another classic in the books! I have to say, Anna Karenina is the most spoiled book I have ever encountered. I was not surprised by the ending because I have seen dozens of books, movies, etc. where the climax of this book is discussed with reckless abandon. If this book has not been spoiled for you yet, and if your luck is anything like mine, read it soon! Russian names: Have you read any Russian authors before? If so, you know that not only are names repeated over and over, they are also often said in totality and they have several variations – some of which are nothing like each other. Because of this, if you try this one, get ready for lots of names and possible confusion over which character is being discussed. But, don’t worry! In general, the key players are easy to follow. Russian politics and labor: While this large tome has lots of story, it also has a lot of discussion on Russian politics and the labor climate at the time it was written. This could prove to be either interesting for you or boring depending on what you are looking for in a book. I did not mind it much; it did not end up being my favorite part of the book, but I do think it added a lot to the atmosphere and setting. The role of Women: Overall, I was left with the impression that during the time this was written, women were treated very unfairly in Russia (and, I am sure, all around the world). No matter what happened or who was at fault, a woman paid the price. I know this still goes on today with women being considered “sluts” if they sleep around, but men are considered “studs”. Shows that in some respects we have not advanced very much as a society! If a story based on unequal treatment based on gender interests you, this is a good one to read and analyze. Overall impression: I enjoyed this book a lot. I have seen many fawn over it as some of the greatest literature ever. I don’t feel like I was quite that enamored with it, but it was an enjoyable, easy to read, follow, and appreciate. I am very glad I took the time to read this classic and if you are looking to take on a big, famous book, this one would not be a bad choice."

        "text":"“ Anna Karenina ,” my friend told me, “is one of the few books that have influenced how I live my life from day to day.” This statement touches on a question I often wonder about: Can reading great fiction make you a better person? I don’t mean to ask whether it can improve your mental agility or your knowledge of the world, for it undoubtedly does. But can these books make you kinder, wiser, more moral, more content? The answer to this question is far from self-evident. And maybe we should be doubtful, when we consider how many disagreeable Shakespeare fans have probably existed. Nevertheless, I suspect that most of us are inclined to say yes, these books do improve us. But how? Here are my answers. First, many great works of fiction tackle the moral question directly: What does it mean to be good? How do you live a good life? What is the point of it all? Dostoyevsky is the exemplary author in this respect, who was intensely, almost morbidly, preoccupied with these questions. Second, great fiction often involves a social critique; many well-known authors have been penetrating guides into the hypocrisies, immoralities, and stupidities of their societies. Dickens, for example, is famous for spreading awareness of the plights of the poor; and Jane Austen performed a similar task in her novels, though much more quietly, by satirizing the narrow, pinched social rules the landed gentry had to abide by. Finally, we come to great literature’s ability to help us empathize. By imagining the actions, thoughts, feelings, desires, and hopes of another person—a person perhaps from a different time, with different values—we learn to see the world from multiple points of view. This not only helps us to understand others, but also helps us to understand ourselves. And this is important, since a big part of wise living (in my experience at least) involves the ability to see ourselves from a distance, as only one person among many, and to treat ourselves with the same good-natured respect as we treat our good friends. And the master of empathy is undoubtedly Leo Tolstoy. Leo Tolstoy was a contradictory man. He idolized the peasants and their simple life, and he preached a renunciation of worldly riches; and yet he maintained his aristocratic privileges till the end of his life. He considered marriage to be of enormous importance in living a moral life, and yet his relationship with his wife was bitterly unhappy and he ended up fleeing his house to escape. And as Isaiah Berlin pointed out in his essay on Tolstoy’s view of history, he yearned for unity and yet saw only multiplicity in the world. I can’t help attributing this contradictoriness to his nearly supernatural ability to sympathize with other points of view, which caused him to constantly be pulled in different directions. This is on full display in Anna Karenina , but I can’t discuss this or anything else about the book without copious spoilers. So if you are among the handful of people who don’t know the plot already, here is your warning. Like so many authors, Tolstoy here writes about a “fallen” woman who ends up in a bad situation. But unlike anyone else, Tolstoy presents this story without taking any clear moral stance on Anna, her society, her betrayed husband, or her lover. It is, for example, close to impossible to read this simply as a parable of the immoral woman getting her just desserts. What was Anna supposed to do? She would have condemned herself to a life of unhappiness had she stayed with Karenin. And it can hardly be said that she was responsible for her unhappy marriage, since marriages in those days were contracted when women were very young, for reasons of power and wealth, not love. Tolstoy makes this very clear, and as a result this book can be read, in part, as a feminist critique of a society that severely limits the freedom of women and condemns them to live at the mercy of their fathers and husbands. But this is not the whole story. If it is impossible to read this book as a parable of an immoral wife, it is equally impossible to read it as the heroic struggle of a wronged women against an immoral society. Anna is neither wholly right nor wrong in her decision. For in choosing to abandon her husband, she also chooses to abandon her son. Admittedly, it was only the social rules that forced her to make this choice, but the fact remains that she knowingly chose it. What’s more, unlike in Madame Bovary , where the deceived husband is not a sympathetic character, Tolstoy brings Karenin to life, showing us an imperfect and limited man, but a real man nonetheless, a man who was deeply hurt by Anna’s actions. A similar ambiguity can be seen in the relationship between Anna and Vronsky. Tolstoy never makes us doubt that they do truly love one another. This is not the story of vanity or lust, but of tender, affectionate love—a love that was denied Anna for her whole life before her affair. For his part, Vronsky is also neither wholly bad nor good. He wrongs Karenin without any moral scruples; but his love for Anna is so deep—at least at first—that he gives up his respectability, his position in the military, and even his good relationship with his family to be with her. I cannot admire Vronsky, but it is impossible for me to condemn him, just like it is impossible for me to condemn Anna or Karenin, for they were all making the choices that seemed best to them. The final effect of these conflicts is not a critique of society nor a parable of vice, but a portrayal of the tragedy of life, of the unhappiness that inevitably arises when desires are not in harmony with values and when personalities are not in harmony with societies. The other thread of this book—that of Levin and Kitty—is where Tolstoy tells us how to be happy. For Tolstoy, this involves a return to tradition; specifically, this means a return to rural Russian tradition and a concomitant shunning of urban European influence. Levin and Kitty’s happy life in the countryside is repeatedly contrasted with Vronsky and Anna’s unhappy life in the city. Levin is connected with the earth; he knows the peasants and he works with them, while Vronsky only associates with aristocrats. Levin is earnest, provincial, and clumsy, while Vronsky is urbane, cosmopolitan, and suave. Kitty is simple, unreflecting, and pure-hearted, while Anna is well-read, sophisticated, and passionate. The most obvious symbol of Europeanization is the fateful railway. Anna and Vronsky meet in a train station; Vronsky confesses his love to Anna in another train station; and it is of course a train that ends Anna’s life. Levin, by contrast, catches sight of Kitty as he sits in the grass in his farm, while Kitty goes by in a horse-drawn carriage. Anna and Vronsky travel to Italy to see the sights, while for Levin even Moscow is painfully confusing and shallow. This contrast of urban Europe with rural Russia is mirrored in the contrast of atheism with belief. Like Dostoyevsky, Tolstoy attributed the growing disbelief in Christianity to the nefarious influence of the freethinking West. In Tolstoy’s view—and in this respect he’s remarkably close to Dostoyevsky—Russians were mistaken to gleefully import European technologies and modes of thought without paying attention to how appropriate these new arrivals were to Russia. Both Tolstoy and Dostoevsky wanted Russia to develop its own path into the future, a path that relied on an embrace of the Christian ethic, not an attempt to fill the vacuum left by religion with socialism and science. The final scene of this novel—where Levin renounces his old free-thinking ways and embraces Christianity—is the ultimate triumph of Russia over Europe in Levin’s soul. But this is where the book rings the most hollow for me. For here Tolstoy is attempting to put up one mode of life as ideal, while his prodigious ability to see the world from so many points of view makes us doubt whether there is such a thing as an ideal life or one right way of viewing the world. At least for me, Tolstoy's magnificent empathy is the real moral lesson I have taken away from this book. His insights into the minds and personalities of different people is staggering, and I can only hope to emulate this, in my own small way, as I fight the lifelong battle with my own ego."

        "text":"Anna Karenina is a remarkable story about society, faith and love. Included is a large range of emotions with some character flaws such as infidelity, unethicalness and selfishness. All the characters are intertwined with Anna in some form. Anna and the Count, Stephen and Dolly, Kitty and Levin the last being the most honest and likeable. Anna's first sighting of Count Vronsky is a string pulling of the heart with the railway station as the backdrop of their meeting. The Count finds Anna's beauty captivating. The love affair between the Count and Anna leads her to act in a way that is not befitting her rank in society. She forgets herself and tells Karenin she loves the Count. A strict moral code leaves Anna socially ostracized by society rules, she is shamed and shunned. Her love is very sad, for her the outcome is truly tragic. Her desires and changes in her life did not really give her physical or mental happiness, mostly suffering. Anna's story is paralleled by that of strong-minded Levin and charming Kitty, frivolous Stiva and loyal Dolly. Dolly finds Steven (charming yet non conforming in his life as a parent and not being responsible to fulfill his role as a husband and father) cheating on her. In yet she has the most ordinary of values in family. She finds great joy in the moments with her children her primary motivation in life giving her great meaning. Princess Kitty and Levin are quite charming and by far my favorite. He is older, their beliefs are different and yet they complement each other quite well. Levin is rejected at first as Kitty is smitten by another and Levin retreats to his farm and has many peasant families working with him. His bouts makes him search for the meaning of life which makes him skeptical in his beliefs. He eventually finds peace with God. He has loved Kitty always. Kitty is sensitive and compassionate. They marry. Life for them is good and their love is true. The story is beautifully written, rich and complex in morals. The novel is a cautionary tale of what not to do. This is not Anna's story it is Levin's and Tolstoy who are one in their moral and spiritual beliefs. “There are as many different kinds of love as there are different hearts” Leo Tolstoy in his timeless novel. Please see additional thoughts in comments."

        "text":"As a daughter of a Russian literature teacher, it seems I have always known the story of Anna Karenina: the love, the affair, the train - the whole shebang. I must have ingested the knowledge with my mother's milk, as Russians would say. My grandpa had an old print of a painting hanging in his garage. A young beautiful mysterious woman sitting in a carriage in wintry Moscow and looking at the viewer through her heavy-lidded eyes with a stare that combines allure and deep sadness. \"Who's that?\" I asked my grandpa when I was five, and without missing a beat he answered, \"Anna Karenina\" . Actually, it was \"A Stranger\" by Ivan Kramskoy (1883) - but for me it has always remained the mysterious and beautiful Anna Karenina, the femme fatale of Russian literature. (Imagine my childish glee when I saw this portrait used for the cover of this book in the edition I chose!) Yet, \"Anna Karenina\" is a misleading title for this hefty tome as Anna's story is just the tip of an iceberg, as half of the story is devoted to Konstantin Levin, Tolstoy's alter ego (Count Leo's Russian name was Lev. Lev --> Levin), preoccupied with Russian peasantry and its relationship to land, as well as torn over faith and his lack of it, Levin whose story continues for chapters after Anna meets her train. But Anna gives the book its name, and her plight spoke more to me than the philosophical dealings of an insecure and soul-searching Russian landowner, and so her story comes first. Sorry, Leo Levin. Anna's chapters tell a story of a beautiful married woman who had a passionate affair with an officer and then somehow, in her quest for love, began a downward spiral fueled by jealousy and guilt and societal prejudices and stifling attitudes. \" But I'm glad you will see me as I am. The chief thing I shouldn't like would be for people to imagine I want to prove anything. I don't want to prove anything; I merely want to live, to do no one harm but myself. I have the right to do that, haven't I? \" On one hand, there's little new about the story of a forbidden, passionate, overwhelming affair resulting in societal scorn and the double standards towards a man and a woman involved in the same act. Few readers will be surprised that it is Anna who gets the blame for the affair, that it is Anna who is considered \"fallen\" and undesirable in the society, that it is Anna who is dependent on men in whichever relationship she is in because by societal norms of that time a woman was little else but a companion to her man. There is nothing new about the sad contrasts between the opportunities available to men and to women of that time - and the strong sense of superiority that men feel in this patriarchial world. No, there is nothing else in that, tragic as it may be. \" Anything, only not divorce!\" answered Darya Alexandrovna. \"But what is anything?\" \"No, it is awful! She will be no one's wife, she will be lost! \" No, where Lev Tolstoy excels is the portrayal of Anna's breakdown, Anna's downward spiral, the unraveling of her character under the ingrained guilt, crippling insecurity and the pressure the others - and she herself - place on her. Anna, a lovely, energetic, captivating woman, full of life and beauty, simply crumbles, sinks into despair, fueled by desperation and irrationality and misdirected passion. \" And he tried to think of her as she was when he met her the first time, at a railway station too, mysterious, exquisite, loving, seeking and giving happiness, and not cruelly revengeful as he remembered her on that last moment. \" A calm and poised lady slowly and terrifyingly descends into fickle moods and depression and almost maniacal liveliness in between, tormented by her feeling of (imagined) abandonment and little self-worth and false passions which are little else but futile attempts to fill the void, the never-ending emptiness... This is what Tolstoy is a master at describing, and this is what was grabbing my heart and squeezing the joy out of it in anticipation of inevitable tragedy to come. \" In her eyes the whole of him, with all his habits, ideas, desires, with all his spiritual and physical temperament, was one thing—love for women, and that love, she felt, ought to be entirely concentrated on her alone. That love was less; consequently, as she reasoned, he must have transferred part of his love to other women or to another woman—and she was jealous. She was jealous not of any particular woman but of the decrease of his love. Not having got an object for her jealousy, she was on the lookout for it. At the slightest hint she transferred her jealousy from one object to another. \" Yes, it's the little evils, the multitude of little faces of unhappiness that Count Tolstoy knows how to portray with such sense of reality that it's quite unsettling - be it the blind jealousy of Anna or Levin, be it the shameless cheating and spending of Stiva Oblonsky, be it the moral stuffiness and limits of Arkady Karenin, the parental neglects of both Karenins to their children, the lies, the little societal snipes, the disappointments, the failures, the pervasive selfishness... All of it is so unsettlingly well-captured on page that you do realize Tolstoy must have believed in the famous phrase that he penned for this book's opening line: \"Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.\" Tolstoy is excellent at showing that, despite what we tend to believe, getting what you wanted does not bring happiness. \" Vronsky, meanwhile, in spite of the complete realization of what he had so long desired, was not perfectly happy. He soon felt that the realization of his desires gave him no more than a grain of sand out of the mountain of happiness he had expected. It showed him the mistake men make in picturing to themselves happiness as the realization of their desires. \" And yet, just like in real life, there are no real villains, no real unsympathetic characters that cause obstacles for our heroes, the villains whom it feels good to hate. No, everyone, in addition to their pathetic little ugly traits also has redeeming qualities. Anna's husband, despite appearing as a monster to Anna after her passionate affair, still is initially willing to give her the freedom of the divorce that she needs. Stiva Oblonsky, repulsive in his carelessness and cheating, wins us over with his gregarious and genuinely friendly personality; Anna herself, despite her outbursts, is a devoted mother to her son (at least initially). Levin may appear to be monstrous in his jealousy, but the next moment he is so overwhelmingly in love that it's hard not to forgive him. And I love this greyness of each character, so lifelike and full. And, of course, the politics - so easily forgettable by readers of this book that carries the name of the heroine of a passionate forbidden affair. The dreaded politics that bored me to tears when I was fifteen. And yet these are the politics and the questions that were so much on the mind of Count Tolstoy, famous to his compatriots for his love and devotion to peasants, that he devoted almost half of this thick tome to it, discussed through the thoughts of Konstantin Levin . Levin, a landowner with a strong capacity for compassion, self-reflection and curiosity about Russian love for land, as well as a striking political apathy, is Tolstoy's avatar in trying to make sense of a puzzling Russian peasantry culture, which failed to be understood by many of his compatriots educated on the ideas and beliefs of industrialized Europe. \" He considered a revolution in economic conditions nonsense. But he always felt the injustice of his own abundance in comparison with the poverty of the peasants, and now he determined that so as to feel quite in the right, though he had worked hard and lived by no means luxuriously before, he would now work still harder, and would allow himself even less luxury. \" I have to say - I understood his ideas more this time, but I could not really feel for the efforts of the devoted and kind landowner striving to understand the soul of Russian peasants. Maybe it's because I mentally kept fast-forwarding mere 50 years, to the Socialist Revolution of 1917 that would leave most definitely Levin and Kitty and their children dead, or less likely, in exile; the revolution which, as Tolstoy almost predicted, focused on the workers and despised the loved by Count Leo peasants, the revolution that despised the love for owning land and working it that Tolstoy felt was at the center of the Russian soul. But it is still incredibly interesting to think about and to analyze because even a century and a half later there's still enough truth and foresight in Tolstoy's musings, after all. Even if I disagree with so many of his views, they are still thought-provoking, no doubts about it. \" If he had been asked whether he liked or didn't like the peasants, Konstantin Levin would have been absolutely at a loss what to reply. He liked and did not like the peasants, just as he liked and did not like men in general. Of course, being a good-hearted man, he liked men rather than he disliked them, and so too with the peasants. But like or dislike \"the people\" as something apart he could not, not only because he lived with \"the people,\" and all his interests were bound up with theirs, but also because he regarded himself as a part of \"the people,\" did not see any special qualities or failings distinguishing himself and \"the people,\" and could not contrast himself with them. \" ======================== It's a 3.5 star book for me. Why? Well, because of Tolstoy's prose, of course - because of its wordiness and repetitiveness. Yes, Tolstoy is the undisputed king of creating page-long sentences (which I love, by the way - love that is owed in full to my literature-teacher mother admiring them and making me punctuate these never-ending sentences correctly for grammar exercises). But he is also a master of restating the obvious, repeating the same thought over and over and over again in the same sentence, in the same paragraph, until the reader is ready to cry for some respite. This, as well as Levin's at times obnoxious preachiness and the author's frequently very patriarchial views, was what made this book substantially less enjoyable than it could have been. -------- By the way, there is an excellent 1967 Soviet film based on this book that captures the spirit of the book quite well (and, if you so like, has a handy function to turn on English subtitles): first part is here , and the second part is here . I highly recommend this film. And even better version of this classic is the British TV adaptation (2000) with stunning Helen McCrory as perfect Anna and lovely Paloma Baeza as perfect Kitty."

        "text":"***Spoiler alert. If you have read this book, please proceed. If you are never going to read this novel (be honest with yourself), then please proceed. If you may read this novel, but it may be decades in the future, then please proceed. Trust me, you are not going to remember, no matter how compelling a review I have written. If you need Tolstoy talking points for your next cocktail party or soiree with those literary, black wearing, pseudo intellectual friends of yours, then this review will come in handy. If they pin you to the board like a bug over some major plot twist, that will be because I have not shared any of those. If this happens, do not despair; refer them to my review. I’ll take the heat for you. If they don’t know who I am, then they are, frankly, not worth knowing. Exchange them for other more enlightened intellectual friends.*** “He soon felt that the fulfillment of his desires gave him only one grain of the mountain of happiness he had expected. This fulfillment showed him the eternal error men make in imagining that their happiness depends on the realization of their desires.” Anna Arkadyevna married Alexei Alexandrovich Karenin, a man twenty years her senior. She dutifully produced a son for him and settled into a life of social events and extravagant clothes and enjoyed a freedom from financial worries. Maybe this life would have continued for her if she had never met Count Alexei Kirillovich Vronsky, but more than likely, her midlife crisis, her awareness of the passage of time, would have compelled her to seek something more. ”They say he’s a religious, moral, honest, intelligent man; but they don’t see what I’ve seen. They don’t know how he has been stifling my life for eight years, stifling everything that was alive in me, but he never once even thought that I was a living woman who needed love. They don’t know how he insulted me at every step and remained pleased with himself. Didn’t I try as hard as I could to find a justification for my life? Didn’t I try to love him… But the time has come, I’ve realized that I can no longer deceive myself, that I am alive, that I am not to blame if God has made me so that I must love and live. And what now? If he killed me, if he killed him, I could bear it all, I could forgive it all, but no, he….” Her husband was enamored with her, but then so was everyone who met her, male or female. Maybe he was too contented with their life together and, therefore, took their relationship for granted. He was two decades older, so the passions of romance didn’t burn with as hot a flame. She wanted passion from him even if it was to murder her lover and herself. Even if it was something tragic, she wanted something to happen, something that would make her feel... something. I couldn’t help thinking early on that the problem wasn’t with her husband, certainly nothing that a new lover could fix for very long. The same face was always going to greet her in the mirror. The same thoughts were always going to swim their way back to the surface. We can not mask the problems within ourselves by changing lovers. The mask will eventually slip, and all will be revealed. Ugly can be very pretty. Is there such a thing as being too beautiful? Can being so beautiful make someone cold, disdainful, and unable to really feel empathy or even connected to those around them? Her type of beauty is a shield that insulates her even as her insecurities swing the sword that stabs the hearts of those who despise her and those who love her. ”She was enchanting in her simple black dress, enchanting were her full arms with the bracelets on them, enchanting her firm neck with its string of pearls, enchanting her curly hair in disarray, enchanting the graceful, light movements of her small feet and hands, enchanting that beautiful face in its animation; but there was something terrible and cruel in her enchantment.” My favorite character in this epic was Konstantin (Kostya) Dmitrich Levin. He was a well meaning, wealthy landowner who, unusually for the times, went out and worked the land himself. He got his hands dirty enough that one could actually call him a farmer. He was led to believe by his friends and even the Shcherbatsky family that their youngest daughter, Kitty, would be an affable match for him. Kitty’s older sister Dolly was married to Stepan (Stiva) Arkadyich Oblonsky, who was the brother to Anna Karenina. Stiva was recently caught and forgiven for having a dalliance with a household staff, but no sooner was he out of that boiling water of that affair before he was having liaisons with a ballerina. This did lead me to believe that life would never be satisfying for either Stiva or his sister Anna because there was always going to be pretty butterflies to chase as the attractiveness of the one they had began to fade. Before Vronsky became gobsmacked by Anna, he was leisurely chasing after Kitty and leading her on just long enough for Kitty to turn Levin’s marriage proposal down flat. That was like catching a molotok (hammer) right between the eyes as a serp (sickle) swept Kostya off his feet. Interestingly enough, later in the book Levin met Anna Karenina, after he has married Kitty (you’ll have to read the book to discover how this comes about), and he was captivated by Anna. It was almost enough for me start chain smoking Turkish cigarettes or biting my nails down to the quick while I waited for the outcome. Substitute Anna for Jolene, and you’ll know what I was humming. ”She had unconsciously done everything she could to arouse a feeling of love for her in Levin, and though she knew that she had succeeded in it, as far as one could with regard to an honest, married man in one evening, and though she liked him very much, as soon as he left the room, she stopped thinking about him.” If she was irritated with Vronsky, one day maybe she would just seduce Levin for entertainment... because she could. I must say that I didn’t think much of Vronsky at the beginning of the novel, but as the plot progressed I started to sympathize with him. Tolstoy was brilliant at rounding out characters so our preconceived notions or the projections of ourselves that we place upon them are forced to be modified as we discover more about them. Levin had his own problems. He had been reading the great philosophers, looking for answers. He found more questions than answers in religion. He abandoned every lifeboat he climbed into and swam for the next one. ”Without knowing what I am and why I’m here, it is impossible for me to live. And I cannot know that, therefore I cannot live.” The problem that every reasonably intelligent person wrestles with is that no matter how successful we are, no matter how wonderful a life we build, or how well we take care of ourselves, we are going to die. It is irrefutable. Cemeteries don’t lie. Well, there is a lot of eternal lying down going on, but no duplicity. None of us are going to escape the reaper. No one is ascending on a cloud or going to the crossroads to make a deal with the Devil. We all have to come face to face with death, and we can’t take any of our bobbles, accolades, or power with us. So the question that Levin ended up asking himself, the Biggest question even beyond, why am I here? is: Why do anything? Without immortality, everything we attempt to do can seem futile. Some would make the case that we live on in our kids and grandkids. I say bugger to that. I want more time! Well, there are ways to be immortal, and one of them is to write a masterpiece like Anna Karenina that will live forever. By the end, I am ready to throttle Anna until her pretty eyes bug out of her head and her cheeks turn a vibrant pink, but at the same time, she seemed to be suffering from a host of mental disorders. She was so cut off from everyone and so disdainful of everyone. ”It was impossible not to hate such pathetically ugly people.” The “friends” she had had been ostracized from her by her own actions. I had to believe her loathing of people was a projection of how she felt about herself. She needed some time on Carl Jung’s couch, but he was a wee tot when this book was published. She needed to find some satisfaction in the ordinary and quit believing that a change in geography or in lovers was ever going to fix what was wrong with herself. She had such a destructive personality. One man tried to kill himself from her actions and another contemplated the act. She was maliciously vengeful when someone didn’t do something she wanted them to do; and yet, I couldn’t quite condemn her completely. Her feelings of being stifled were perfectly natural. We all feel that way at points in our lives. We feel trapped by the circumstances of our life. Her attempt to break free in the 1870s in Russian society was brave\/foolish. She sacrificed everything to chase a dream. The dream ate her. This book is a masterpiece, not just a Russian masterpiece but a true gift to the world of literature.

        "text":"welcome to...ANNA DECEMBERENINA! it's the start of the month (kinda). i've attempted a (reprehensible) pun on a book title (to everyone's chagrin). there is a notoriously long classic on my currently reading (ill-advisedly). you know what that means. IT'S PROJECT LONG CLASSIC TIME, the fan favorite in which i read a very long book divided up into little bits over the course of the month, and usually i drag elle along with me except this month i'm planning something truly nightmarish so i'm starting while she's asleep as an act of terror \/ peer pressure. let's do this. DAY 1: PAGES 1-25 my tbr review of this was \"sometimes i like to pretend i'm capable of reading thousand-page books. just for fun,\" and in this case that pretending includes starting 2 days early and doubling up eventually so that i can read in 25 page chunks. i'm cool like that. damn! that opening line! we are off to the races. DAY 2: PAGES 26-75 didn't even intend to make today my bonus day but this is just so readable. why didn't anyone tell me the 900 page classic from 150 years ago is unputdownable?? i fear i may adore all of these characters. DAY 3: 76-100 in a state of bliss right now in which i look forward to reading this every day but am relishing it so much that dividing it into sections works perfectly. DAY 4: 101-125 literally any book is doable in teeny chunks like this. i had negative free time (and a negative interest) today but boom. easy money. DAY 5: 126-150 the descriptions of emotions in this...sheesh. excellence. DAY 6: 151-175 and here we have the farming sections i've heard so much about... in truth if they're like this every time i can handle it. i like poetic descriptions of the descent of springtime as much as the next annoying girl. DAY 7: 176-200 i am absolutely indulging in vronsky's downfall here. finding pleasure in his every misfortune. his sadness and disappointment spark joy for me. hate that guy. DAY 8: 201-225 well jesus anna! we're only at the 25% mark, we can't act like this already! DAY 10: 226-250 i missed a day. i'm a nightmare person. now i have to see how many pages i can manage in, generously, 20 minutes. perhaps unsurprisingly it took 25 and i'm not caught up. DAY 11: PAGES 251-275 something fun that the universe and i are doing is that we've set up the last three weeks of the year so that i don't only have to finish 24 books, complete two projects, and remain active on seemingly 100 accounts, but i also have the busiest work week(s) i have had in (without exaggeration) 2 years. without the depressive episode that made the last time so fun. anyway i may never catch up on this. DAY 13: PAGES 276-300 guess who's behind. behind again. emma's behind. except she never caught up in the first place so now she's just...50 pages behind instead of 25. or i guess 75 since i haven't actually read any yet today. okay NOW 50. why is this book so good?? DAY 14: PAGES 301-350 well, well, well. look who decided to catch up. biiiiig farming chapters. DAY 15: PAGES 351-375 part four alert. we pray for mercy from agricultural labor bureaucracy content. and our prayers are heard <3 DAY 16: PAGES 376-400 KITTY AND LEVIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! wow i am so invested in this. even dozens of pages about farming and politics can't divest me. i am in it. DAY 17: PAGES 401-425 way, way, way too much is happening. it's the halfway point, people! this is no time for climaxes OR happily ever afters, let alone both! we have 400+ pages to cover! DAY 18: PAGES 426-450 i am uncomfortable with how high stakes everything is. THERE IS SO MUCH LEFT. WHEN I HEFT THIS UNWIELDY VOLUME I AM ONLY AT THE HALFWAY POINT EVEN STILL. I THINK. EVEN THOUGH I'VE BEEN SAYING THAT FOR SEEMINGLY DAYS. DAY 19: 451-475 honestly i care less about the Christian Art than the farming. sheesh. DAY 20: 476-500 it's the circleeee of lifeee... DAY 21: 501-525 what a moral quandary we find ourselves in! DAY 22: 526-550 okay phew, i'm back on board with being obsessed with anna. it makes me uncomfortable to not like a female character who is constantly committing moral wrongs...feels unnatural. part 5 done! DAY 23: 551-575 i'm internally titling this one twenty-five page chunk number 23: the tangled webs we weave. get it together, folks! it's like a sally rooney novel in here. DAY 24: 576-600 this too realistically conveyed the feeling of being clinically annoyed by a friend of a friend. i feel irritable now. DAY 28: 601-650 it's the most wonderful time of the year... read: it's actually december 26, meaning we have actually skipped right to day 28, and i am extremely behind just in time for the end of the year to be right around the corner. but i'm also behind on my other project , and i'm also behind on my actual literal reading challenge, so we're just going to ignore that for today. no time for worrying, only time for reading. actually read 50 pages anyway because i am perfect and infallible. DAY 31: PAGES 651-700 being very brave and reading 50 pages again and also pretending anna isn't on my damn nerves. GIRL STAND UP. we find ourselves heading into part 7. never mind. it's not hard to not be bugged by anna. she's the sh*t. DAY 32: PAGES 701-750 anna is so evil and kitty is so perfect. i love them both. DAY 33: PAGES 751-817 it appears it is time. hello and welcome to the last day of the anna karenina project. oh man. OVERALL not only was i intimidated by this book's length, i was sure i'd find it unconquerable. even as i started it and found it a pleasure, i was waiting for the other shoe to drop. it never did! i enjoyed this every day, through farming and politics and religion and art. readable and sweeping, stunning in its writing and its carrying across effortlessly of both the minutiae and the most important topics of life. it's insane how applicable, how of the moment this book is now, across languages and centuries. read it! i can't believe how long i put it off. rating: 4.5"

        "text":"As part of my reading challenge this year, I wanted to read at least one or two classics, and Anna Karenina was high on my list. It's considered by many to be one of the best novels ever written, and I've never read any Tolstoy. So even though it's a monster at more than 800 pages, I decided it's time I conquered it. The story starts out so strong, with what seems to be an insightful treatise into the family and romantic life of several characters, including title character Anna. The domestic strife, misunderstandings, affairs, and life in general of the Russian elite, when boiled down to its essentials, are not so different from what occupy people's attentions today. I found the initial chapters to be interesting, and was drawn towards the circle of people who would make up the main cast of the book. Then as the story progressed, things started to reach their natural conclusions, until about halfway through the book. At that point, I wish Tolstoy would have stopped because I found the second half to be more or less unnecessary. Everything had been resolved by then. But Tolstoy continued, and for me, the story just fell apart after that. The main characters, in particular Anna, having gotten what they wished for, started acting loony, for lack of a better word. The more their wishes came true, the unhappier they became. A good portion of the second half was devoted to Anna lamenting how her partner does not love her. Every time he goes somewhere, she would pounce on him as soon as he comes home, saying crazy things about how he must be thinking of other women and no longer of her. He would reassure her constantly of his love and unending devotion. She wouldn't listen, so when he inevitably would get frustrated, she took that as confirmation that he doesn't love her. She would leave messages for him not to bother her, and when he doesn't, she would take that as a sign that she is right. This went on for like 200 pages. I wanted to stab myself every time Anna showed up in a scene. It's hard to tolerate a book when you dislike the main character that much. I'm also a little uncomfortable that Tolstoy seems to portray women in his story as weak and mentally unstable, while the men are portrayed as high-thinking orators. The women would fly into tears and rages at the drop of a hat, stirring up domestic trouble while their men are out doing their jobs or hanging out with their buddies. The women also blushed uncontrollably when talking to any man who isn't their husband. Maybe this is just the way it was during Tolstoy's time and this book would have been seen as progressive, but as a modern woman reading it now, it makes me cringe so hard. Tolstoy also seems to have treated this book as a vehicle to get out whatever he wanted to say on a variety of topics, including farming techniques, local governments and elections, the meaning of life, religion, snipe shooting, duty and rights of citizens, etc. This book is full of philosophical musings on these topics and more. I don't mind when authors want to present interesting and tangential thoughts, but Tolstoy did it constantly and without filter. His ramblings would go on for many chapters, and were so unedited that it's essentially a stream of consciousness. I'm sure there are some good points in there, but it's so buried under pages of unreadable and irrelevant prattle that I couldn't find them. While these technical and philosophical ruminations are all throughout the book, they were much worse in the second half, taking up a significant portion of it. Reading this 800+ page tome has been an odyssey. I didn't find any of the characters to be particularly likable or charming. They were all rather silly, unstable, or full of themselves. To me, this is far from one of the best books I've ever read, though it's possible that back then, when there wasn't much to read or do for fun, this would have fulfilled that role. Now I can say I have read Anna Karenina , but that's about as much as I got out of it. ~~~~~~~~~~~~ ✧ Connect with me ✧ Instagram ✧"

        "text":"In the beginning, reading Anna Karenin can feel a little like visiting Paris for the first time. You’ve heard a lot about the place before you go. Much of what you see from the bus you recognize from pictures and movies and books. You can’t help but think of the great writers and artists who have been here before you. You expect to like it. You want to like it. But you don’t want to feel like you have to like it. You worry a little that you won’t. But after a few days, you settle in, and you feel the immensity of the place opening up all around you. You keep having this experience of turning a corner and finding something beautiful that you hadn’t been told to expect or catching sight of something familiar from a surprising angle. You start to trust the abundance of the place, and your anxieties that someone else will have eaten everything up before your arrival relax. (Maybe that simile reveals more about me than I’d like.) My favorite discovery was the three or four chapters (out of the book’s 239) devoted to, of all things, scythe mowing—chapters that become a celebratory meditation on physical labor. When I read those chapters, I felt temporarily cured of the need to have something “happen” and became as absorbed in the reading as the mowers are absorbed in their work. Of course, the book is about Anna and Vronsky and Levin and Kitty and Dolly and poor, stupid Stepan Arkadyich. It’s about their love and courtship and friendship and pride and shame and jealousy and betrayal and forgiveness and about the instable variety of happiness and unhappiness. But it’s also about mowing the grass and arguing politics and hunting and working as a bureaucrat and raising children and dealing politely with tedious company. To put it more accurately, it’s about the way that the human mind—or, as Tolstoy sometimes says, the human soul—engages each of these experiences and tries to understand itself, the world around it, and the other souls that inhabit that world. This book is not afraid to take up any part of human life because it believes that human beings are infinitely interesting and infinitely worthy of compassion. And, what I found stirring, the book’s fearlessness extends to matters of religion. Tolstoy takes his characters seriously enough to acknowledge that they have spiritual lives that are as nuanced and mysterious as their intellectual lives and their romantic lives. I knew to expect this dimension of the book, but I could not have known how encouraging it would be to dwell in it for so long. In the end, this is a book about life, written by a man who is profoundly in love with life. Reading it makes me want to live."

        "text":"This is a book that I was actually dreading reading for quite some time. It was on a list of books that I'd been working my way through and, after seeing the size of it and the fact that 'War And Peace' was voted #1 book to avoid reading, I was reluctant to ever get started. But am I glad that I did. This is a surprisingly fast-moving, interesting and easy to read novel. The last of which I'd of never believed could be true before reading it, but you find yourself instantly engrossed in this kind of Russian soap opera, filled with weird and intriguing characters. The most notable theme is the way society overlooked mens' affairs but frowned on womens', this immediately created a bond between myself and Anna, who is an extremely likeable character. I thought it had an amazing balance of important meaning and light-heartedness. Let's just say, it's given me some courage to maybe one day try out the dreaded 'War And Peace'."

        "text":"WARNING: This is not a strict book review, but rather a meta-review of what reading this book led to in my life. Please avoid reading this if you're looking for an in depth analysis of Anna Karenina . Thanks. I should also mention that there is a big spoiler in here, in case you've remained untouched by cultural osmosis, but you should read my review anyway to save yourself the trouble. I grew up believing, like most of us, that burning books was something Nazis did (though, of course, burning Disco records at Shea stadium was perfectly fine). I believed that burning books was only a couple of steps down from burning people in ovens, or that it was, at least, a step towards holocaust. If I heard the words \"burning books\" or \"book burning,\" I saw Gestapo, SS and SA marching around a mountainous bonfire of books in a menacingly lit square. It's a scary image: an image of censorship, of fear mongering, of mind control -- an image of evil. So I never imagined that I would become a book burner. That all changed the day Anna Karenina, that insufferable, whiny, pathetic, pain in the ass, finally jumped off the platform and killed herself. That summer I was performing in Shakespeare in the Mountains , and I knew I'd have plenty of down time, so it was a perfect summer to read another 1,000 page+ novel. I'd read Count of Monte Cristo one summer when I was working day camps, Les Miserable one summer when I was working at a residential camp, and Shogun in one of my final summers of zero responsibility. A summer shifting back and forth between Marc Antony in Julius Caesar and Pinch, Antonio and the Nun (which I played with great gusto, impersonating Terry Jones in drag) in Comedy of Errors , or sitting at a pub in the mountains while I waited for the matinee to give way to the evening show, seemed an ideal time to blaze through a big meaty classic. I narrowed the field to two by Tolstoy : War and Peace and Anna Karenina . I chose the latter and was very quickly sorry I did. I have never met such an unlikable bunch of bunsholes in my life (m'kay...I admit it...I am applying Mr. Mackey's lesson. You should see how much money I've put in the vulgarity jar this past week). Seriously. I loathed them all and couldn't give a damn about their problems. By the end of the first part I was longing for Anna to kill herself (I'd known the ending since I was a kid, and if you didn't and I spoiled it for you, sorry. But how could you not know before now?). I wanted horrible things to happen to everyone. I wanted Vronsky to die when his horse breaks its back. I wanted everyone else to die of consumption like Nikolai. And then I started thinking of how much fun it would be to rewrite this book with a mad Stalin cleansing the whole bunch of them and sending them to a Gulag (in fact, this book is the ultimate excuse for the October Revolution (though I am not comparing Stalinism to Bolshevism). If I'd lived as a serf amongst this pack of idiots I'd have supported the Bolshies without a second thought). I found the book excruciating, but I was locked in my life long need to finish ANY book I started. It was a compulsion I had never been able to break, and I had the time for it that summer. I spent three months in the presence of powerful and\/or fun Shakespeare plays and contrasted those with a soul suckingly unenjoyable Tolstoy novel, and then I couldn't escape because of my own head. I told myself many things to get through it all: \"I am missing the point,\" \"Something's missing in translation,\" \"I'm in the wrong head space,\" \"I shouldn't have read it while I was living and breathing Shakespeare,\" \"It will get better.\" It never did. Not for me. I hated every m'kaying page. Then near the end of the summer, while I was sitting in the tent a couple of hours from the matinee (I remember it was Comedy of Errors because I was there early to set up the puppet theatre), I finally had the momentary joy of Anna's suicide. Ecstasy! She was gone. And I was almost free. But then I wasn't free because I still had the final part of the novel to read, and I needed to get ready for the show, then after the show I was heading out to claim a campsite for an overnight before coming back for an evening show of Caesar. I was worried I wouldn't have time to finish that day, but I read pages whenever I found a free moment and it was looking good. Come twilight, I was through with the shows and back at camp with Erika and my little cousin Shaina. The fire was innocently crackling, Erika was making hot dogs with Shaina, so I retreated to the tent and pushed through the rest of the book. When it was over, I emerged full of anger and bile and tossed the book onto the picnic table with disgust. I sat in front of the fire, eating my hot dogs and drinking beer, and that's when the fire stopped being innocent. I knew I needed to burn this book. I couldn't do it at first. I had to talk myself into it, and I don't think I could have done it at all if Erika hadn't supported the decision. She'd lived through all of my complaining, though, and knew how much I hated the book (and I am pretty sure she hated listening to my complaints almost as much). So I looked at the book and the fire. I ate marshmallows and spewed my disdain. I sang Beatles songs, then went back to my rage, and finally I just stood up and said \"M'kay it!\" I tossed it into the flames and watched that brick of a book slowly twist and char and begin to float into the night sky. The fire around the book blazed high for a good ten minutes, the first minute of which was colored by the inks of the cover, then it tumbled off its prop log and into the heart of the coals, disappearing forever. I cheered and danced and exorcised that book from my system. I felt better. I was cleansed of my communion with those whiny Russians. And I vowed in that moment to never again allow myself to get locked into a book I couldn't stand; it's still hard, but I have put a few aside. Since the burning of Anna Karenina there have been a few books that have followed it into the flames. Some because I loved them and wanted to give them an appropriate pyre, some because I loathed them and wanted to condemn them to the fire. I don't see Nazis marching around the flames anymore either. I see a clear mountain night, I taste bad wine and hot dogs, I hear wind forty feet up in the tops of the trees, I smell the chemical pong of toxic ink, and I feel the relief of never having to see Anna Karenina on my bookshelf again. Whew. I feel much better now."

        "text":"People are going to have to remember that this is the part of the review that is entirely of my own opinion and what I thought of the book, because what follows isn't entirely positive, but I hope it doesn't throw you off the book entirely and you still give it a chance. Now... my thoughts: I picked up this book upon the advice of Oprah (and her book club) and my friend Kit. They owe me hardcore now. As does Mr. Tolstoy. This book was an extremely long read, not because of it's size and length necessarily, but because of it's content. More often than not I found myself suddenly third a way down the page after my mind wandered off to other thoughts but I kept on reading... am I the only one with the ability to do that? You know, totally zoning out but continuing to read? The subject I passed over though was so thoroughly boring that I didn't bother going back to re-read it... and it didn't affect my understanding of future events taking place later on in the book. Leo Tolstoy really enjoys tangents. Constantly drifting away from the point of the book to go off on three page rants on farming methods, political policies and elections, or philosophical discussion on God. Even the dialogue drifted off in that sort of manner. Tolstoy constantly made detail of trifling matters, while important subjects that added to what little plot line this story had were just passed over. Here is a small passage that is a wonderful example of what constantly takes place throughout the book: \"Kostia, look out! There's a bee! Won't he sting?\" cried Dolly, defending herself from a wasp. \"That's not a bee; that's a wasp!\" said Levin. \"Come, now! Give us your theory,\" demanded Katavasof, evidently provoking Levin to a discussion. \"Why shouldn't private persons have that right?\" No mention of the wasp is made again. Just a small example of how Tolstoy focuses much more on philosophical thought, and thought in general, more than any sort of action that will progress the story further. That's part of the reason the story took so long to get through. The editing and translation of the version I got also wasn't very good. Kit reckons that that's part of the reason I didn't enjoy it as much, and I am apt to agree with her. If you do decide to read this book, your better choice is to go with the Oprah's Book Club edition of Anna Karenina . The characters weren't too great either and I felt only slightly sympathetic for them at certain moments. The women most often were whiny and weak while the men seemed cruel and judgemental more often than not. Even Anna, who was supposedly strong-willed and intelligent would go off on these irrational rants. The women were constantly jealous and the men were always suspicious. There's not much else to say that I haven't already said. There were only certain spots in the book which I enjoyed in the littlest, and even then I can't remember them. All in all I did not enjoy this book, and it earned the names Anna Crapenina and Anna Kareniblah. But remember this is just one girl's opinion, if it sounded like a book you might enjoy I highly advise going out to read it. Just try and get the Oprah edition."

        "text":"I am happy to have discovered this little marvel of deciphering nature and human passions, not in my 'Russian classics' around 20 years ago! At the time, I found significant serenity there, especially with Dostoievski. Today, regarding the question of maturity or only of work, I see something quite different: a magnificent painting of the human condition, both beautiful and tragic, with many ironies and even more finesse in the psychological analysis. In short, it is a masterpiece. As the title suggests, we follow the story of Anna Karenina, the wife of a high Russian dignitary; she is beautiful, healthy, joyful, and radiant until she meets passion, its complications, and its compromises. But, as the title does not indicate, there is also a whole gallery of portraits: her lover Vronsky, sometimes enthusiastic seducer, a sometimes responsible and wise man; her husband Karenina, all confided in his respectability but touched by his sufferings and his dignity; Levine, accurate literary double of Tolstoi according to the notice, the tortured, the pragmatist and the lover; Kitty, the simple, sweet and good woman, after having been a little brainless; the good-natured but well-intentioned parasite Oblonski; and so many others which will take us to the mundane and somewhat idle salons of Saint Petersburg, the revolutionary circles, the district assemblies or deep into the Russian countryside. What is extraordinary (or terrible, depending on which point of view you take) is that you find yourself in the characters and the situations. I am not a 19th-century Russian aristocrat engaged in a passionate affair. Yet I understand her, especially in her paradoxes, constant doubts, inability to stop the spiral of arguments, her interpretations distorted by anxiety, his exaltation, and his absolute love. So much more than the adulterous woman, it is the incarnation of the woman in love: if she had lived today, with the possibilities of divorce and professional activity for women, could she have loved Vronsky? And quietly? I'm not sure. And she will remain a tragic heroine with whom I especially would not like to identify! Although I don't look like the heroine, I am thrilled by my reading, which explains why this review is probably confusing."

        "text":"What is the most important thing about Anna Karenina? Is it the first line, \"Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way\"? This sounds so true but it isn't really. Is it that Anna experiences much more intolerance for her unfaithfulness and leaving her husband than does her brother who screws around like a dog? Is it Konstantin Levin's attempts to marry into the aristocracy and his problem with religion? Or is the entire story just Tolstoy's way of seducing the reader into reading the political nub of the story, the feudalism that was at the heart of all politics, morality and social position. I enjoyed the book when I read it, but I have to say I skimmed over a lot of the politics and did wonder which in Tolstoy's heart is the story he wanted to tell, love stories or political ones? How I came to read Anna Karenina, appendicitis and an air hostess ending with a rotten tomato. I read this book when I was 13. I had a test on it in two days and hadn't even opened it so I said I had stomach ache and went to the school sick room. This was a tall, narrow room with a tiny window about 8' up and painted with shades of olive green and aubergine (eggplant). If you weren't sick going in.. those colours.... But I was away in Russia with Anna, her husband Alexei and Count Vronsky whom I swooned over. In the early hours of the morning, I really had stomach ache. At 4 a.m. I had an emergency appendectomy in a nursing home with an operating theatre. I was very sick indeed and in bed for weeks. Had I brought it on myself? Never mind. Next day three things happened, one bad and one good and one fantastic. My period came on for the first time. I was a Woman! Yes! I told my mother and my grandmother leaned over from the visitor chair and slapped my face very hard, \"That's to take the shock of the blood away.\" She said. Then the good. My mother said I had been waiting for this day and she really let loose at my grandmother. They had a very fierce row. It was wonderful. My mother didn't love me and she never ever defended me or involved herself with me in any way. Memories of being slapped herself I suppose. My mother was very pretty and was the first of her family to be married. On her wedding day, her mother slapped her face as she put the veil on her. \"Ruth should have been married first, not you.\" Ruth was her much less attractive and zealously-religious older sister. (She mellowed). Everyone else in the nursing home was old except for an air hostess of 21. She didn't have a private room and didn't like being with the old people so would wander into mine to sit and read and eat all my chocolates, of which I had endless boxes. She brought her books - Jane Austen, Charlotte Bronte, Mrs. Gaskell and Zola. So for nearly three weeks my days were filled with reading, talking about books with my new friend and eating chocolates all day long. I was actually thrown out of the nursing home. The food there was terrible. One lunchtime there was something forgettable and salad. The tomato was perfect-looking but mushy, almost liquid so I threw it out of the window and it landed on one of the nuns who was beside herself with anger. I didn't care, my friend had left a few days before, left her books for me too in exchange for some fancy ribbon-bowed boxes of chocolates. We wrote for a bit, were penpals, but eventually that died. The age gap and where we were in our lives was too far apart. But I will always remember her and the fabulous books she introduced me too. Thank you Helen. I will never forget Anna Karenina, apart from Tolstoy's political rants and plight of the peasants etc, the book was a pure gold, convoluted love affair. It was like all the best books are, total immersion in another world populated by real people whose lives outside of those described you could easily imagine, not just \"well-drawn characters\". Austen, Bronte, Mrs. Gaskell and Zola were just as good, all of them worlds I lived in when I read their books. Review 1\/2020 Rewritten 15th Jan 2020 to include more about the book."

        "text":"I don’t know where to start...I guess at the beginning. “All happy families resemble one another, but each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.” -Leo Tolstoy Exactly one month ago, scared out of my mind, I opened up this book and read that first line. After that it was all over for me because I was completely HOOKED!!! I had to fight with myself about putting the book down so I could get enough sleep. I brought it with me everywhere in case there was a spare moment when I could escape into its pages. This is one of the most truly remarkable stories I’ve ever read, and I’ve read a great many books!! Going in, I knew that this story would mainly be about two characters, Anna (of course) and Levin. I went in thinking that Anna’s tragical tale of woe would be my preferred point of view. I also knew that there were chapters dedicated to Levin’s agricultural pursuits, and I honestly thought that they would bore me and slow down my reading pace. Oh how wrong past Carolyn was!! The exact opposite happened, Levin’s storyline was the one that captured my heart, as well as his precious love for mowing fields with a scythe. Everytime I read about Levin my heart would melt into a great big puddle. His aspirations for simply wanting to be with the one woman he loves, and living as a humble farmer just made me feel and fall for him all at the same time. Watching his character development from the beginning of the book to the end was incredibly moving and brilliantly written. Reading this story felt like watching a gifted musician compose a grand symphony. Anna, oh my poor Anna! My feelings and sympathies towards her tended to fluctuate while I read. In the beginning, I felt sorrow for her being in a loveless marriage. Then, when love did come walking in, he brought her inevitable fate along with him. I wanted her and Vronsky to be happy together and for them to take pride in their love for eachother. The slow and sad progression of their bond was something that I thought about deeply. Their choices towards the children involved left me feeling quite uneasy. The more I read the more tension I felt coming off the pages. This all culminated in the very prolific “train scene.” Ironically, I read the train scene riding the train myself, on my way back to NYC. As I read about the approaching train, my own train’s wheels were squeaking and the car itself started rocking. I was completely and utterly transported into the story, while being elevated by my own surroundings. I had to stop reading and collect myself because I could feel my face growing red and my eyes start to water. It was a reading experience I will never forget. To read that exact scene on a train myself was indescribable. That’s when I really knew that this book was unlike any other I’ve ever read. I could feel every word, sensation, noise, and breath while reading, not only that scene, but all of them. Anna’s fate although heartbreaking was raw and honest, and I don’t think this book would have remained one of the most profound books ever written if her destiny was changed. Along with our two brilliantly written main characters, the way each character’s story weaved together felt like watching someone hand weave silk threads into a beautiful piece of fabric. Each page felt like a gift that I never wanted to stop opening. The amount of times I read a particular line and was then entirely moved is innumerable. It felt like Tolstoy put his whole heart into each and every line. One of my absolute favorite lines is from the point of view of Levin (of course), “He tried not to look long at her, as if she were the sun, yet he saw her, like the sun, even without looking.” *insert crying noises here* Anne Karenina has become one of (if not) my favorite classics ever. It is tied neck and neck with Jane Eyre for first place, but it is so hard to say. It’s impossible to compare books because each one is different from the other, and that’s what makes this thing called reading so much fun!! I have so much more to say, but I don’t think any configuration of words will ever fully articulate how much I love and adore this book. The fact that this story is over makes me feel quite empty inside, which was half the reason why I practically cried my eye’s out when I read the final page. Yet, the most uplifting aspect of a well written story, is that once the author and their characters make their way inside your heart, there they will remain."

        "text":"\"Leo Tolstoy would meet hatred expressed in violence by love expressed in self-suffering.\" —Mahatma Gandhi Through reading this praiseworthy classic, I have been forced to recalibrate my previously unreliable view of this celebrated author. You see, I was force-fed Tolstoy at college (his writing, not his flesh, silly! Mine wasn't a college for cannibals!) and at the time only carried War and Peace under one arm so I might appear cleverer than I actually was. So, how amazed was I that Anna K has shown me the fun side to Leo T? He is slyly hilarious. How did I not know this? Please note that I haven't read this novel in Russian Cyrillic. I acknowledge that my perception owes a great deal to the amazing interpretive work of the translators, but let's imagine that we in the West have enjoyed his work as the great man intended. The title is something of a misnomer and doesn't do justice to an endearing love story that also captures the disparity between city and country life in 19th-century Russia. For a start, Anna K isn't the star of the show. That billing falls to our anti-hero, Konstantin Dmitrich Levin, a socially awkward, highly intelligent loner who considers himself to be an ugly fellow with no redeemable qualities. Despite being weighed down by all this existential angst, he worships Kitty Shcherbatskaya, an attractive young princess whom he believes to be out of his league. Kitty is described as being \"as easy to find in a crowd as a rose among nettles.\" Tolstoy goes to great lengths to make us understand the inner workings of Levin's mind (For Tolstoy, read Levin: they are one and the same). Levin's love rival, raffishly handsome Count Vronsky, couldn't be more dissimilar. He is socially adept and careful not to offend, whereas Levin could probably start an argument with a goldfish. What a fabulous read this is. Tolstoy's levity and perspicacity shine from every page and the badinage between the main characters is exquisitely observed. He does though have an idiosyncratic way of writing: adjectives are thickly laid on with a trowel and he loves to use repetition to emphasise a point. Anna herself is fascinating, and to affirm just how fascinating she is, Tolstoy employs the word fascinating seven times in one paragraph! Look! I've even started doing it myself! How fascinating! When not beating you about the head with repetition, the Russian master can do majestic descriptive imagery as well as anyone. One simple scene, where Kitty collapses into a low chair, her ball gown rising about her like a cloud, was just perfectly captured. This is a wonderful story of fated love and aristocratic hypocrisy. Tolstoy uses Levin as his political mouthpiece to rail against the ills of late 19th-century Russia, and the author's philosophy of non-violent pacifism also directly influenced none other than Mahatma Gandhi. Anna Karenina is often cited as 'one of the best books ever written'. So who am I to disagree?"

This tome is my second foray into Leo Tolstoy’s work, my first being a short novel, The Death of Ivan Ilych. “Honesty is only a negative qualification,” he said. – Anna Karenina by Leo Tolstoy At the center of this story is Anna Karenina who is a charming, married woman who falls in love with Count Vronsky (definitely not her husband). It also focuses on Dolly and Stepan Oblonsky as well as Kitty and Levin. This book is written in such a style where you can “hear” the characters’ thoughts, and it highlighted the difference in how men and women are treated in society. And if it was just the romance and societal tension, I would have rated this book 5 stars. However, there was a lot of commentary about peasants and religion. As I am not an expert in Russian history\/politics of 1878, this part was a bit over my head. I felt like I needed a wise sage to guide me through these parts. This book is interesting enough and worthy of a reread, but I would have to rope in a person a bit wiser than myself to help me along.

        "text":"Not since I read The Brothers Karamazov have I felt as directly involved in characters' worlds and minds. Fascinating. I was hooked on Anna Karenina from the opening section when I realized that Tolstoy was brilliantly portraying characters' thoughts and motivations in all of their contradictory, complex truth. However, Tolstoy's skill is not just in characterization--though he is the master of that art. His prose invokes such passion. There were parts of the book that took my breath because I realized that what I was reading was pure feeling: when we realize that Anna is no longer pushing Vronsky away, when Levin proposes to Kitty, and later when Levin thinks about death. The book effectively threw a shroud over me and sucked me in--I almost missed my train stop a couple of times. That being said, there were some parts that were difficult to get through. I felt myself slowing down in Part VI. I was back in through the remainder of the book once I hit Part VII, but I understand how the deep dive into politics and farming can be off-putting. Still, in those chapters Tolstoy's characters are interacting, and it's incredible to see them speak and respond to one another. It's not only worth the trouble, but deep down, it's no trouble at all. It's to be savored, and sometimes we must be forced to slow down and think about the characters' daily life as they navigate around in their relationships. A word about this translation. When I was in college I attempted to read the Constance Garnett translation. I didn't stop because it was awful (I think finals came up, then the holidays, then more classes, etc.). However, I never really felt like the words were as powerful as they should have been. Years later, the only image that stuck in my mind was of Levin meeting Kitty at the ice skating rink. I just never really entered the world of Anna Karenina , perhaps my fault more than anything. However, the diction and sentence construction in Pevear and Volokhonsky's translation is poetic and justifies the title \"masterpiece.\" Through this translation I grew to appreciate Tolstoy not just because he told good, philosophical stories, but because he could do so with utmost subtletly and compactness--yes, I think Tolstoy is concise. Each word has its place. Understandably, many are unwilling to give themselves to this book. Many expect it to do all of the work. But it's an even better read because if the reader works, the experience of reading this book is incredible."

        "text":"Tolstoy draws a portrait of three marriages or relationships that could not be more different. Anna Karenina is rightly called a masterpiece. Moreover Tolstoy does not spare on social socialism and describes the beginnings of communism, deals with such existential themes as birth and death and the meaning of life. Tolstoy’s narrative art and his narrative charm are at the highest level. He also seems like a close observer of human passions, feelings and emotions. All in all I was touched by his book because it was one of the most impressive books I have ever read. \"Kendi yüceliğinin yüksekliğinden bana bakmasına bayılıyorum\".

        "text":"As someone who loves classic literature, Anna Karenina is probably the most substantial novel I’ve ever read - 1 of Leo Tolstoy ’s 3 monumental masterpieces. Despite the title, Anna actually is not the sole protagonist. The novel follows 2 main storylines: 1 centered on Anna, the other on Levin. Through the people around them - their relationships, emotions, and choices - Tolstoy paints a vivid and profound portrait of 19th-century Russian aristocratic life. The story revolves around love and marriage: Anna and her husband Alexei, Anna and Vronsky, Levin and Kitty, Stiva and Dolly. Through Levin’s evolving thoughts, Tolstoy explores his views on life, love, society, and the kind of family life he admires. These characters’ lives are intricately woven together, reflecting the complexities of a class on the brink of decline. Potential Spoilers Ahead! Anna is portrayed as nearly perfect - beautiful, graceful, intelligent, cultured, and morally upright. Even judged by aristocratic standards, she’s exceptional. If not for the emotional void that Vronsky awakens in her, she would’ve been universally admired. Tolstoy never diminishes her outward elegance, even when her soul is falling apart. She’s not someone to condemn - she’s a tragic figure who evokes deep sympathy and frustration, which we end up projecting onto the people and society around her. She’s no longer young, a devoted mother to her 8-year-old son, with a refined taste in art and literature. She’s charming, magnetic in social settings, and even Levin - newly married - finds himself drawn to her. Morally, she’s compassionate and kind, caring for a suicidal worker, her sister-in-law, and her nieces and nephews. Even other women, despite their jealousy, can’t bring themselves to dislike her. But all of this unravels with a single glance from Vronsky on a train. Her emotional world begins to crack, and her suppressed desires explode. Her pain stems from her husband’s coldness and hypocrisy. On the surface, her marriage looks ideal - Alexei is powerful and successful. But he’s obsessed with status and work, neglecting Anna entirely. Their relationship is polite but hollow. Anna sees him as a well-oiled machine - efficient, respectable, but soulless. He provides everything materially, but emotionally, he drains her. A woman is like a flower, needs emotional nourishment. Without it, she either wilts like a rose or grows wild like a poppy - beautiful but poisonous. And what about Vronsky? He’s not a villain. He falls for Anna’s beauty and gives up everything for her - his career, his reputation, even his family. He’s talented, generous, admired, and artistic. He’s like a proud, graceful stallion, loved by all. But like someone enchanted by a poppy’s beauty and addicted to its poison, he loses himself in Anna. He tries to build a life with her, even attempts suicide twice. Yet people still blame him for the tragedy. Alexei, Anna’s husband, isn’t entirely blameless either. He’s emotionally detached, and when he discovers Anna’s affair, he becomes even colder, refusing to divorce her and trapping everyone - Anna, Vronsky, their son - in a moral cage. He’s incapable of love, but he does experience deep pain. At 1 point, he even shows compassion for Anna’s child with Vronsky. In a way, his life is destroyed too. Anna and Vronsky face not just social judgment but internal torment. Anna knows her overwhelming emotional needs are consuming her. She tries to break things off after giving birth to their daughter, clinging to her son as her last anchor. But after reconnecting with Vronsky, she spirals into obsession. Her love becomes insatiable - like a poppy needing endless sun and water. Even their child becomes a source of resentment. Not even Italy’s beauty and art can soothe her. Her melancholy and emotional hunger become a burden for Vronsky. They drain each other, unable to stop. Their dream of love lasts less than a year. They return to aristocratic society, and Vronsky tries to build a new life, hoping marriage will fix things. But Anna’s paranoia and emotional intensity make that impossible. Their final fight ends with Anna’s suicide. Vronsky, shattered, heads to the front lines. Thankfully, there’s Levin. He’s Tolstoy ’s semi-autobiographical character, and he brings warmth and depth to the novel. If Anna’s story gives the book its tragic weight, Levin’s journey elevates it to something truly profound. Levin is ordinary - no dramatic highs or lows. He’s not cynical like his brother Nikolai, nor brilliant like Sergei. He’s awkward, skeptical of aristocratic games, uninterested in politics, and doubtful of religion. He’s more like a humble landowner than a nobleman. He cares about his farm and his workers, joins them in labor, and wants to improve their lives. But even his efforts fail. His intellectual pursuits stall after marriage, and he’s often overwhelmed by life’s demands. He’s not young or charming. He’s rejected by Kitty, crushed emotionally, and retreats into hard labor to cope. He’s shy, naive, and clueless about love and marriage. Even after marrying Kitty, he doubts his happiness. He’s unprepared for everything - wedding plans, pregnancy, childbirth. Without Kitty’s support, his life would be chaos. He never reforms his estate or finishes his book. His only success is marrying Kitty, but even that joy is quickly replaced by everyday struggles. The novel ends here, almost abruptly. Anna and Vronsky’s story has closure, but Levin’s doesn’t. He’s still searching, still thinking, and his final realization doesn’t offer a clear philosophical answer. But maybe that’s the point. Levin’s ordinariness makes the novel extraordinary. He’s relatable, real. We can step into his shoes, feel his emotions, and follow his evolving thoughts. He doesn’t chase greatness, but he works hard. He doesn’t envy status, but he builds genuine friendships. He’s not wealthy, but he’s happy. He’s simple, but thoughtful. He avoids flashy clubs and enjoys honest labor. He’s timid in love, but wins Kitty’s heart. Everyone around him - Stiva, Dolly, Nikolai, Sergei, Anna, Vronsky - finds comfort or connection in Levin. Even with his flaws, people love him. He lacks the typical aristocratic traits, but he embodies the virtues that truly matter. Tolstoy uses Levin to show that the qualities society often overlooks - honesty, humility, kindness - are the ones that lead to real happiness. The aristocrats seem enviable, but their misery is painfully real. Through Levin, Tolstoy critiques both the old nobility and modern capitalist values that chase wealth, status, and pleasure at the cost of morality, happiness, and human connection. Levin’s fear of death after Nikolai’s passing leads him to existential despair. He feels like a fleeting bubble in the vast universe. Science and philosophy fail to comfort him. In the end, he turns to the religion he once abandoned. Though disproven by science, faith gives him meaning - more than any theory ever could. So if philosophy is the highest peak of the rational world, then in the emotional world, nothing stands taller than love. Love is this blazing, sincere, selfless feeling that cuts straight to the heart. It’s pure and precious - often overwhelming, yet hard to put into words. It’s like the “Zen” in a monk’s heart - only truly understood through experience, passed from soul to soul. Funny thing is, those people who talk about love the most are often the ones who’ve never truly experienced it. These so-called “experts” end up describing something that’s not love at all - more like a messy mix of lust, desire, ethics, money, logic, and analysis. It’s like a stir-fry of everything but the real thing. And when love loses its true face, it becomes hard to swallow. So yeah, I know this piece I’m writing is probably flawed and flimsy, but I’m still putting it out there - call it a bit of dreamy rambling. Love, marriage, and family - they’re not the same thing. Love is deeply personal. It’s emotional, not rational. It’s free, untamed, and rooted in human nature. You can suppress it, but you can’t train it. That’s why Anna and Vronsky’s love hits so hard. It’s fiery and unstoppable. Anna gives up her family and even her life for love. Vronsky gives up his future and goes against high society for it. Real love is like that - it defies social judgment, breaks through chaos, ignores rules and expectations. It crosses cities and countrysides just to say, “I love you.” True love doesn’t care about ethics or moral codes. In rejecting those, it stays true to the human heart and protects the purity and freedom love deserves. Marriage and family, though? Totally different. Marriage is more like a social contract between 2 people. Family brings in material concerns. Unlike love, which is emotional and personal, marriage and family are social and rational. That’s why they’re bound by ethics and norms - they’re about stability, not passion. Take Oblonsky and Dolly, for example. Their marriage revolves around property, income, kids, chores. Romance fades, passion wears down, but what matters is that Oblonsky comes back after cheating, and Dolly stays after her rage. What matters is compromise, realism, and responsibility. Sadly, we often confuse love with marriage - like 1 must lead to the other, or that marriage must be built on love. But their very nature hints at a deep conflict: individual vs. society, freedom vs. rules, emotion vs. reason. When these collide, tragedy often follows. That conflict is clearest in Anna and Vronsky’s story. Anna, a married woman, falls for Vronsky. What could’ve been a fleeting affair turns into a full-blown relationship - living together, a difficult childbirth, a child out of wedlock. They openly challenge Anna’s marriage, society’s moral boundaries, and every social norm. And why? Because they love each other deeply and want to build a life together. Their love becomes a clash between human emotion and societal rules. That clash proves impossible to resolve. Anna, crushed by social rejection and Vronsky’s growing coldness, chooses to end her life. Vronsky, heartbroken, heads to the battlefield. Even if love ultimately loses to societal pressure, does that mean their love wasn’t real? Can we really sit on our moral high horses and judge people who stood on the peak of human emotion? Honestly, anyone with a shred of humanity would struggle to make such a cold judgment. Anna and Vronsky’s love was genuine. It had nothing to do with marriage or being a “third party.” I think anyone who meets their own “Anna” or “Vronsky” would feel their heart skip a beat. The difference is, some act on it - like Anna and Vronsky - and some bury it deep inside, like those of us clinging to moral superiority. So no, their love isn’t something to condemn. The real issue is that they tried to turn that love into a marriage, into a family. That’s where society steps in, and judgment begins. That’s the tragedy. Compare that to Levin and Kitty’s relationship - it’s a quieter kind of conflict. Their love is clearly aimed at marriage. Tolstoy doesn’t dwell much on their romance - it basically starts with Levin’s proposal. Their wedding, though, is one of the novel’s most beautiful moments, and their ending is sweet and enviable. But it makes me wonder, right: was Levin’s love real? Did he marry because he loved Kitty, or did he love her because he wanted to marry? Levin’s attention shifts between 3 sisters - first the eldest, then the second, and finally Kitty. So it’s fair to question whether he truly loved her. It feels like he designed a family first, then picked someone to fill the role. His goal was so clear, it almost seems like he loved himself more than anyone else. He wanted a companion, and mistook that for love. That’s what sets him apart from Vronsky. Levin is steady and romantic, but he never experiences the kind of all-consuming passion Vronsky does. And that passion - that overwhelming, selfless love - is what makes great love so unforgettable. Still, Levin and Vronsky are alike in one way: they both mix love with marriage and family. Levin loses true love for the sake of marriage. Vronsky loses marriage because of true love. In that sense, both are tragic. I often imagine - what if Anna and Vronsky had stopped at mutual attraction, or just one magical night? Maybe then their love would’ve stayed pure, untouched by the weight of expectations. Maybe that first meeting at the train station would’ve been their most cherished memory. Or what if they had escaped judgment and married like Levin and Kitty? Would they, years later, end up like Oblonsky and Dolly - romance gone, stuck in routine? Love is beautiful because it’s pure. But that purity makes it fragile. Even the most passionate love can’t survive the grind of daily life, let alone the crushing weight of moral expectations. The most heartbreaking moment in the novel isn’t Anna’s final leap - it’s Vronsky trying to remember their happiest times, only to feel those memories poisoned forever. Maybe love should just be love. Not about marriage. Not about family. Not about possession or permanence. Maybe it’s the distance between us and the stars that makes them eternal. 5 \/ 5 stars (Really sorry - I think I rambled on for way too long. But that’s what happens when the book I’m reading is that good)."

        "text":"A few months ago I read Anna in the Tropics, a Pulitzer winning drama by Nilo Cruz. Set in 1920s Florida, a lector arrives at a cigar factory to read daily installments of Anna Karenina to the workers there. Although the play takes place in summer, the characters enjoyed their journey to Russia as they were captivated by the story. Even though it is approaching summer where I live as well, I decided to embark on my own journey through Leo Tolstoy's classic nineteenth century classic novel. Although titled Anna Karenina after one of the novel's principle characters, this long classic is considered Tolstoy's first 'real' novel and his take on a modernizing country and on people's lives within it. The novel begins as Anna Karenina arrives in Moscow from Petersburg to help her brother and sister-in-law settle a domestic dispute. Members of Russia's privileged class, Darya \"Dolly\" Alexandrovna discovers that her husband Stepan Arkadyich \"Stiva\" Oblonsky has engaged in an affair with one of their maids. Affairs being a long unspoken of part of upper class life, Dolly desires to leave her husband along with their five children. Anna pleads with Dolly to reconcile, and the couple live a long, if not tenuous, marriage, overlooking each other's glaring faults. While settling her brother's marriage, Anna is reminded of her own unhappy marriage, setting the stage for a drama that lasts the duration of the novel. Tolstoy sets the novel in eight parts and short chapters with three main story lines, allowing for his readers to move quickly through the plot. In addition to Stiva and Dolly, Tolstoy introduces in part one Dolly's sister Kitty Shcherbatsky, a young woman of marriageable age who is forced to choose between Count Vronsky and Konstantin Dmitrich Levin. At a ball in Kitty's honor, Vronsky is smitten with Anna, temporarily breaking Kitty's heart. Even though Levin loves Kitty with his whole heart, Kitty refuses his offer in favor of Vronsky, and falls into a deep depression. Levin, seeing the one love of his life reject him, vows to never marry. Anna becomes a fallen woman and rejects her husband in favor of Vronsky, fathering his child, leaving behind the son she loves. Even those closest to her, including family members, are appalled. A G-D fearing woman in a religious society is supposed to view marriage as sacred. Yet, Anna does not value her loved ones' advice and chooses to live with Vronsky. Despite a comfortable, upper class life, Anna is in constant internal turmoil. Spurned by a society that clings to its institutions as marriage and the church, Anna chooses love yet isolation from all but Vronsky and their daughter. Her ex-husband is viewed as a strict adherent to the law, cold, and unsympathetic, and will not grant a divorce. Even though Anna is clearly in the wrong, Tolstoy has his readers sympathizing with her situation, rooting for a positive outcome. He brings to light the plight of lack of women's rights, especially in regard to divorce, and has one hoping that Russia changes her ways as she modernizes. If Anna's situation sheds light on the worst of Russian society and Dolly's reveals its stagnation, then Kitty, who later marries Levin, shows how the country begins to modernize. Kostya and Kitty marry for love, rather than gains in society. Believed by many to be Tolstoy's alter ego, Levin is an estate farmer who is well aware of the rights of his tenant farmers called muzhiks. Along with his brother Sergei Ivanovich, Levin works toward agrarian reform. Both men, Sergei Ivanovich especially, is swept up in the communist ideals that are beginning to form, in rejection of the tsarist governing of the country. Tolstoy diverges pages at a time to farming reforms and one can see in these pages his own beliefs for the future of Russia in the late 19th century. Through the three principle couples: Stiva and Dolly, Vronsky and Anna, and Levin and Kitty, Tolstoy presents the old, changing, and new Russia. Having Levin introduce farming mechanisms from the west and Vronsky participate in a Slavic war, Tolstoy presents a Russia that is no longer completely isolated. He reveals how communism begins to shape up as farmers are no longer happy as tenants and many privileged classes adhere to newer values. Meanwhile, through Dolly, Anna, and Kitty, Tolstoy also presents how a woman's role in this society changes, including schooling and her place in a marriage. As the twentieth century nears, Russian life is no longer set in antiquated ways. Had I not read a drama set in the tropics, I most likely would not have journeyed to 19th century Russia. I enjoyed learning about Leo Tolstoy's views on life there and how he saw late 19th century Russia as a changing society. I found the plight his title character depressing while reading about Levin and Kitty to be uplifting as Russia moves toward the future. Tolstoy's words are accessible in spite of the novel's length, a testament to the stellar translation done by Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky. A true classic, I enjoyed my time with the characters in Anna Karenina, and rate Tolstoy's premier novel 5 shining stars."

        "text":"Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way. This opening sentence sums up the main theme of this great work: family relationships. Tolstoy has chosen three families to work on the different aspects of this theme. The first family is that of Anna and the second family is that of Levin and Kitty. The third and a little less prominent than the other two is the family of Dolly and Stepan. Anna's story, for which the book is well known and loved, occupies a greater part of the book. Anna is young. Having married a man nearly twenty years elder to her at a very young age, Anna is not exposed to the feelings of love and passion a woman would feel for a man. Alexey, an ambitious man who treats her wife to every material comfort, fails to give Anna the care, attention, and love which she needed. Anna's later reference to her husband as \"he is not a man but a machine...\" shows how unfeeling he has been towards her. The comforter and saviour of her life was his son, Seryozha, for whom she had devoted her life while being a dutiful wife. But the fateful meeting with Count Vronsky changes her path of life. Anna's realization of what is missing in her life coupled with the newborn feelings of love and passion for Vronsky takes her through a destructive and tragic path. The widespread view on Anna's story is that of a woman's infidelity in carrying out an adulterous affair. While this view is correct, there is more to it than that of mere adultery. The relationship between the threesome is complex. Anna is bound by duty and honour to her husband while she passionately loves Vronsky. She is torn between wronging her husband and her desire to live happily with the man she loves. Moreover, Anna is worried about the consequences that her action would have on her relationship with her precious son. Her son and Vronsky are the love of her life but one excludes the other. For this reason, she refuses a divorce thus willingly demoting her to a humiliating position by living as an \"immoral woman\" in the eyes of the society. Her self-sacrifice of character simply to retain her relationship with her son is to be admired and pitied. And though at times, Anna was infuriating, the story is written in such a way that it was difficult to blame her. This is why Anna has become a tragic heroine. Vronsky and Alexey (either could be seen as the villain in this tragic story according to the personal views of the reader) on the other hand are both victims in their own right. Both are to be sympathized, perhaps Vronsky a little more than Alexey, as he gave up all his life ambitions for his love for Anna. In contrast to Anna's tragic story, a \"happy\" conventional family is provided by Levin and Kitty. Despite the differences of character, temperament, views, and beliefs Levin and Kitty manage to carry on a successful and loving marriage. The family relationship between Levin and Kitty is modeled on Tolstoy's own convictions on marriage. The relationship between Dolly and Stepan comes between these two extremes. In the light of Stepan's infidelity and his expensive way of living, Dolly and her children suffer considerably. Dolly would like to walk out of the marriage. But her children, convention, and her religious beliefs all contribute to her indecision on the course of action. A vain belief that her husband's conduct is not \"infidelity of the heart\" keeps her going on with her \"sham\" marriage. The book consists of two separate yet interconnected plots: One is the plot woven around Anna and the other is the plot woven around Levin. Former, with its complex emotions, social conventions coupled with women's position legally and socially, provides for the excitement and life of the entire work. The latter, more or less modeled on Tolstoy's life, provides for the political, philosophical, social, and religious views of the author as well as an insight into the author's life struggles. I liked both plots. Each has complemented the other to produce a complete work in every sense. And the characters which were modeled by Tolstoy's observance of the society were felt real. There were no characters that one could call artificial. Above all what is most striking is the beautiful writing of Tolstoy. His use of metaphors is very clever and marvelous. Reading the book was like eating a rich and thick layered piece of cake. No matter how many layers are peeled, its taste does not diminish. Words would not do justice to say how much I loved this work. It is one brilliant and marvelous piece of work. A work can be a great classic, but to become a masterpiece, the author has to steer it above common ground. And Tolstoy has achieved this end quite brilliantly.

        "text":"Alright, I'm going to do my best not to put any spoilers out here, but it will be kind of tough with this book. I should probably start by saying that this book was possibly the best thing I have ever read. It was my first Tolstoy to read, and the defining thing that separated what he wrote from anything else that I've read is his characters. His characters are unbelievably complex. The edition of this book that I read was over 900 pages, so he has some time to do it. His characters aren't static, but neither are they in some kind of transition from A to B throughout the book. They are each inconsistent in strikingly real ways. They think things and then change their minds. They believe something and then lose faith in it. Their opinions of each other are always swirling. They attempt to act in ways that align with something they want, but they must revert back to who they are. But who a character is is a function of many things, some innate and some external and some whimsical and moody. So all the characters seem too complex to be characters in a book. It's as if no one could write a character that could be so contradictory and incoherent and still make them believable, so no one would try to write a character like Anna Karenina. But people are that complex, and they are incoherent and that's what makes Tolstoy's characters so real. Their understandings of each other and themselves are as incoherent as mine of those around me and myself. One of the ways that Tolstoy achieves this is through incredible detail to non-verbal communication. He is always describing the characters movements, expressions, or postures in such a way that you subtly learn their thoughts. He does an amazing job in the internal monologues the characters experience. You frequently hear a character reason with himself and reveal his thoughts or who he is to you in some way, and all the while you feel like you already knew that they felt that or were that. Even as the characters are inconsistent. There are times when he can describe actions that have major implications on the plot with blunt and simple words and it still felt rich because the characters are so full. The book takes on love, marriage, adultery, faith, selfishness, death, desire\/attraction, happiness. It also speaks interestingly on social classes or classism. He also addresses the clash between the pursuit of individual desires and social obligations\/restraints. There is just so much to wrestle with here. And you go through a myriad set of emotions and impressions of the characters as you read. At times you can love or hate or adore a character. You can be ashamed of or ashamed for or reviled by or anxious with or surprised by a character. And you feel this way about each of them at points. But it isn't at all a roller coaster ride of emotion. It's fluid and natural and makes sense. One of the many points that the book seemed to reach to me was the strength and power of love. Tolstoy displays it in all its power and all its inability. In the end love is not sufficient enough to sustain. He writes tremendous triumphs for it, and then he writes the months after when the reality of human failings set in. But love is good, and there is hope. Life can be better with love in it. Should I have kids one day I think I'll make reading this book a precondition for them to start dating (that and turning 25). I was also surprised by a section towards the end of the book where Tolstoy through Levin, my favorite character and the one that I identified with the most, makes a case for Christianity that was so simple but at the same time really impacted me. I guess I'll leave that alone here. Basically, I don't have high enough praise for this book. I hope everyone reads it. It is very long, and I found the third quarter or so slow. But I could definitely read it again. Not soon but it could become a must read every 15 years or so for me. Between he nature of the content and the quality of the words, I would say that this is the greatest masterpiece in words that I've ever found."

        "text":"Levin (which is what the title should be, since he is the main character, the real hero and the focus of the book!) (But who would read the book with that title, I know!) If you don't want to know the ending, don't read this review, though I won't actually talk about what happens to Anna specifically, something I knew 40 years ago without even reading the book. I didn't read the book to find out what happens to her. I knew that. Probably many of you know or knew the ending before reading the book. And this isn't so much a review as a personal reflection. I was tempted, finally, after decades of NOT reading it, to now, approaching my 60th birthday, finish it, all 818 pages, tempted to just simply write: Pretty good! :) But I resist that impulse, sorry (because now, if you so choose to read on, you will have to read many more than those two words. . .). This is as millions of people have observed over the past 140 years, a really great book, and those of you who are skeptical of reading \"Great Books\" or \"classics\" may still not be convinced, but this has in my opinion a deserved reputation of one of the great works of all time, and one of the reasons it IS so good is because it speaks humbly and eloquently against pomposity and perceived or received notions of \"greatness.\" Why do I care about its place in the canon? I guess I really don't. I just think some books deserve the rep they get from the literary establishment, and some deserve the rep they get from the wider reading public. This one is a great literary accomplishment AND a great read, in my opinion, and deserves to be read and read widely by more than just the English major club. And I say this as one who prefers Dostoevsky to Tolstoy; I seem to prefer stories of anguish and doubt to stories of affirmation and faith, and the atheist\/agnostic literary club I belong to is maybe always going to favor doubt and anguish over faith and hope and happiness. But to make clear: This surely is a book of faith, of family, of affirmation, of belief in the land, nature, goodness, and simple human joys over the life of \"society\" with all of its pretension. Yes, all that affirmation is true of the book in spite of what happens to Anna. I write this in particular contexts, as we all do when we read and write. If I had read this book in my more cynical early twenties, when I actually started it once (and again a few times over my life time and never finished), when I had no kids, I might not have liked it much. If I had read this right after Crime and Punishment and The Brothers Karamazov, or in the years I was first reading Under the Volcano, Kafka, Camus, what I think of as my existentialist years, I might have found it too. . . life-affirming. But today I have kids, and as seemed to have happened with Chris Ware, as evidenced by his more positive Building Stories, having kids changed everything for me, and in a good way. In harsh times, you need stories of hope and goodness, and Levin's story is a timeless story of hope and goodness. Another context: I am particularly shaken as I write this by the 20 kids dead in a Connecticut elementary school in Sandy Hook yesterday, with, too, a good teacher, principal, and school psychologist and others who have given their lives to doing good for children, senselessly slaughtered. This is a murderous country, the most murderous in the world, killings devastating my Chicago on a daily basis maybe especially this year, but every damned year. And despair\/suicide is possibly more prevalent than ever. Maybe it is time for a bit of reordering priorities toward goodness, and finishing this book as my news feeds gave me updates on the tragedy provides an interesting contrast in experiences, rendering different but altogether persuasive truths about the nature of the world. Tolstoy was himself, the translator Richard Pevear writes in his fine, brief introduction, in some sense writing a response to the nihilists who were as he saw it in fashion in late nineteenth century Russia, in Moscow, in Europe, in the world. Tolstoy was himself searching for meaning in life and struggling with faith and beliefs in a way he didn't ever struggle about again (or as much) after this book, and the struggle makes for the greatness, in my opinion. His late book Resurrection, by contrast, has none of the struggle about faith that this book has in it. It's mostly a binary world, all Good and Evil, a didactic allegory. Pevear says one of the two main characters, Levin, the country farmer struggling to also write his ideas about farming, is the most fully realized self-portrait that Tolstoy created, and he is on the main pretty delightful. Grumpy at times, stubborn, moody and not witty, a kind of no-nonsense traditionalist I certainly would have been annoyed at regularly if I knew him, Levin is often a kind of comical character, self-deprecatingly clueless as he approaches the Big Events of his life: His brother's death, his proposal to Kitty, the birth of his first child. These are also moments of real angst\/anguish and passion and comedy\/tragedy, written with great flourish and amazing detail, great sections of the book, pretty thrilling to read, in my opinion. These are, Tolstoy tells us, in the main what life (and literature) is and should be mainly about, love and death, and they deserve loving attention for us, as are also the striving for goodness and faith. The current art scene of the time, in especially Moscow's theater and art and literature scenes, the world of fashion, the culture of massive-debt-incurring spending on a lavish lifestyle, all this Tolstoy skewers through the comical eyes of the simple farmer Levin, who at his best is so attached to the land, to family, to love, to good talk, and good friendship. But he is not a stereotype, he is a great character, fully realized. And what can we say of Anna, the other main character, his sort of opposite? Well, if you want to look for what is in some sense a \"moral\" of this huge tome of a book, this might be it: “If you look for perfection, you'll never be content.” Or, if you want to be happy you will want to make choices that Levin makes instead of Anna's tragic choices--but Anna, in having been originally intended by Tolstoy (thanks to Pevear here for his introduction) as an immoral woman, a woman corrupted by city values, is never really only that, any more than Levin can be seen as a holy man. Tolstoy is creating literature here, not a didactic tract, and we see all along that Tolstoy falls in love with Anna as she emerges through his creation of her in his novel, and she is thus for him and us real and fascinating, a human being, and a wondrous one in many ways, one of the great women of literature, without question. You don't have to agree with her choices or like her, but she will come to life for you as few characters ever will. And many of you will fall in love with her as Tolstoy did. As I did, I'll admit. There's one time Tolstoy has his two main characters meet, and this is a great evening, where the simple Levin actually is obviously attracted to Anna in so many ways, and not just the physical attraction all men and women seem to have for her. Levin, like Tolstoy, sees that Anna is vital, viscerally alive, she's fascinating, interesting; okay, she IS a romantic heroine, but she is a romantic heroine that anyone reading romances should read. The women of Wuthering Heights, Jane Eyre, Anna Karenina, Madame Bovary, these are \"romances\" but they are all so much more, that sweep you into the world in richer and deeper ways. Anna Karenina is, like War and Peace, like The Brothers Karamazov, a rich cultural forum, a series of linked meditations on farming and politics and religion and family and relationships and war and the meaning of life, not just about sex and romance. You get so much out of it, as it is all about reflecting on and teaching you how the mundane aspects of our lives are worth paying attention to (I know the bulk of readers absolutely hate the farming and politics sections of the book, but I would contend it is all relevant to Tolstoy's webbed narrative reflection on the meaning of life). And Anna, in the very center of this tale, as a kind of twin contrast to Levin, but not a simple one (they are both suicidal at times; they both are moody and struggle and are essentially lonely for much of the book), is one shimmering, tragic character we can't simply dismiss for submitting to and crushing her life (as she does) through lust for Vronsky. We come to understand her well, we come to understand why she does what she does and why we must pity her and even support her, love her. I know a lot of people have not come to this position about her, they dismiss her as a shallow twit who throws her life away for an also shallow, callous dashing fellow, but in the end we even come to like Vronsky and pity him, and admire his resilience. He IS also an attractive character, in many ways, in spite of his shallow aspects. And maybe we are even sympathetic for them in this forbidden, unwise love. I know I am. We care for them. Of the other main characters, I liked Kitty, Levin's wife (who deals with the dying of her husband's brother so deftly as opposed to her clueless husband) a lot, and who becomes attracted to Vronsky too in a way as so may women seem to do. Levin's two brothers are both great, and provide the basis for rich conversations. The Dolly\/Oblonsky pair are yet another view of a married relationship. I even like the portrait of the sad, stiff Karenin, the diplomat we can see is a good man, certainly not a great lover for Anna, but we see his struggles and come to feel sorry for him, I think. He's not an ideal match for the passionate Anna, maybe, but he's a good and essentially blameless man. I like all the minor characters we get to meet, too, the people Tolstoy finds more genuine than all the upper crust he mocks and derides and, you know, also cares about. This is a great book, my friends, with some great characters and great scenes. And now to the movie? I read one blurb that said without Tolstoy's gorgeous writing, any movie version of Anna Karenina will only be a soap opera, and that is what I feared. . . and that is what I found in seeing it. The movie couldn't begin to capture Tolstoy's reflections on life and love and birth and death. It was a melodrama, a good one but not great or rich as the novel. And what do English readers miss, as my friends who read Russian and have grown up reading his prose IN Russia say? That his use of the Russian language is unparalleled, gorgeous, breathtaking. Well, I don't know the language in which Tolstoy wrote, but this translation of his tale is pretty amazing, I think. But in any language, read it, my friends. PS I have also recently read Madame Bovary, which I also liked in spite of the main character's (also) bad choices. I liked Anna K even more, though."

        "text":"\"I think... if it is true that there are as many minds as there are heads, then there are as many kinds of love as there are hearts.\" ― Leo Tolstoy, Anna Karenina As I drew back the cover and stepped into the world of the Russian aristocracy, I found myself entranced by the excess and proper etiquette. A realm of high society so foreign, so inviting, that I couldn’t turn away. My eyes devoured Tolstoy’s delicious words like the sweetest candy. The characters called me in, seating me in the front row where I would have the best view. The book became an electric moment in time as their stories bewitched me. I urged Levin not to give up on love. I watched on in disbelief as a perfectly beautiful Anna was overcome with a passion that turned her into someone she no longer knew. I was dumbfounded at how Vronsky, a man filled with selfish desire, could so easily tear apart everyone who came near him and soldier on as if it were merely another day. These three were only a tiny portion of the troupe that would dominate my mind as I became wrapped up in their fates as if they were my own.. Love and pain, two such opposite emotions, yet intricately tied to one another. These were the driving forces behind this fantastic tale. It was a study of connections and intense passions, that ran the gamut from husband and wife to the affection that a man has for his country. In the end, the weight was almost unbearable for each that leapt. No matter which kind of love, there is always a price, and they had to be willing to pay it. Very soon after I started this book, I knew the tracks would no longer be there for many of my favorite characters and that I would plunge into the abyss along with them if I didn’t get off at the next stop. I couldn’t leave them. I needed to be a part of their world even if it ended badly. As much affection as this story gave, it equally took back in tears and heartbreak. The story is brilliant, and I could never do it justice here. If you haven’t read Anna Karenina I urge you to put aside the fact that it is a very lengthy novel and take it up. I am forever changed."

        "text":"Another classic in the books! I have to say, Anna Karenina is the most spoiled book I have ever encountered. I was not surprised by the ending because I have seen dozens of books, movies, etc. where the climax of this book is discussed with reckless abandon. If this book has not been spoiled for you yet, and if your luck is anything like mine, read it soon! Russian names: Have you read any Russian authors before? If so, you know that not only are names repeated over and over, they are also often said in totality and they have several variations – some of which are nothing like each other. Because of this, if you try this one, get ready for lots of names and possible confusion over which character is being discussed. But, don’t worry! In general, the key players are easy to follow. Russian politics and labor: While this large tome has lots of story, it also has a lot of discussion on Russian politics and the labor climate at the time it was written. This could prove to be either interesting for you or boring depending on what you are looking for in a book. I did not mind it much; it did not end up being my favorite part of the book, but I do think it added a lot to the atmosphere and setting. The role of Women: Overall, I was left with the impression that during the time this was written, women were treated very unfairly in Russia (and, I am sure, all around the world). No matter what happened or who was at fault, a woman paid the price. I know this still goes on today with women being considered “sluts” if they sleep around, but men are considered “studs”. Shows that in some respects we have not advanced very much as a society! If a story based on unequal treatment based on gender interests you, this is a good one to read and analyze. Overall impression: I enjoyed this book a lot. I have seen many fawn over it as some of the greatest literature ever. I don’t feel like I was quite that enamored with it, but it was an enjoyable, easy to read, follow, and appreciate. I am very glad I took the time to read this classic and if you are looking to take on a big, famous book, this one would not be a bad choice."

        "text":"“ Anna Karenina ,” my friend told me, “is one of the few books that have influenced how I live my life from day to day.” This statement touches on a question I often wonder about: Can reading great fiction make you a better person? I don’t mean to ask whether it can improve your mental agility or your knowledge of the world, for it undoubtedly does. But can these books make you kinder, wiser, more moral, more content? The answer to this question is far from self-evident. And maybe we should be doubtful, when we consider how many disagreeable Shakespeare fans have probably existed. Nevertheless, I suspect that most of us are inclined to say yes, these books do improve us. But how? Here are my answers. First, many great works of fiction tackle the moral question directly: What does it mean to be good? How do you live a good life? What is the point of it all? Dostoyevsky is the exemplary author in this respect, who was intensely, almost morbidly, preoccupied with these questions. Second, great fiction often involves a social critique; many well-known authors have been penetrating guides into the hypocrisies, immoralities, and stupidities of their societies. Dickens, for example, is famous for spreading awareness of the plights of the poor; and Jane Austen performed a similar task in her novels, though much more quietly, by satirizing the narrow, pinched social rules the landed gentry had to abide by. Finally, we come to great literature’s ability to help us empathize. By imagining the actions, thoughts, feelings, desires, and hopes of another person—a person perhaps from a different time, with different values—we learn to see the world from multiple points of view. This not only helps us to understand others, but also helps us to understand ourselves. And this is important, since a big part of wise living (in my experience at least) involves the ability to see ourselves from a distance, as only one person among many, and to treat ourselves with the same good-natured respect as we treat our good friends. And the master of empathy is undoubtedly Leo Tolstoy. Leo Tolstoy was a contradictory man. He idolized the peasants and their simple life, and he preached a renunciation of worldly riches; and yet he maintained his aristocratic privileges till the end of his life. He considered marriage to be of enormous importance in living a moral life, and yet his relationship with his wife was bitterly unhappy and he ended up fleeing his house to escape. And as Isaiah Berlin pointed out in his essay on Tolstoy’s view of history, he yearned for unity and yet saw only multiplicity in the world. I can’t help attributing this contradictoriness to his nearly supernatural ability to sympathize with other points of view, which caused him to constantly be pulled in different directions. This is on full display in Anna Karenina , but I can’t discuss this or anything else about the book without copious spoilers. So if you are among the handful of people who don’t know the plot already, here is your warning. Like so many authors, Tolstoy here writes about a “fallen” woman who ends up in a bad situation. But unlike anyone else, Tolstoy presents this story without taking any clear moral stance on Anna, her society, her betrayed husband, or her lover. It is, for example, close to impossible to read this simply as a parable of the immoral woman getting her just desserts. What was Anna supposed to do? She would have condemned herself to a life of unhappiness had she stayed with Karenin. And it can hardly be said that she was responsible for her unhappy marriage, since marriages in those days were contracted when women were very young, for reasons of power and wealth, not love. Tolstoy makes this very clear, and as a result this book can be read, in part, as a feminist critique of a society that severely limits the freedom of women and condemns them to live at the mercy of their fathers and husbands. But this is not the whole story. If it is impossible to read this book as a parable of an immoral wife, it is equally impossible to read it as the heroic struggle of a wronged women against an immoral society. Anna is neither wholly right nor wrong in her decision. For in choosing to abandon her husband, she also chooses to abandon her son. Admittedly, it was only the social rules that forced her to make this choice, but the fact remains that she knowingly chose it. What’s more, unlike in Madame Bovary , where the deceived husband is not a sympathetic character, Tolstoy brings Karenin to life, showing us an imperfect and limited man, but a real man nonetheless, a man who was deeply hurt by Anna’s actions. A similar ambiguity can be seen in the relationship between Anna and Vronsky. Tolstoy never makes us doubt that they do truly love one another. This is not the story of vanity or lust, but of tender, affectionate love—a love that was denied Anna for her whole life before her affair. For his part, Vronsky is also neither wholly bad nor good. He wrongs Karenin without any moral scruples; but his love for Anna is so deep—at least at first—that he gives up his respectability, his position in the military, and even his good relationship with his family to be with her. I cannot admire Vronsky, but it is impossible for me to condemn him, just like it is impossible for me to condemn Anna or Karenin, for they were all making the choices that seemed best to them. The final effect of these conflicts is not a critique of society nor a parable of vice, but a portrayal of the tragedy of life, of the unhappiness that inevitably arises when desires are not in harmony with values and when personalities are not in harmony with societies. The other thread of this book—that of Levin and Kitty—is where Tolstoy tells us how to be happy. For Tolstoy, this involves a return to tradition; specifically, this means a return to rural Russian tradition and a concomitant shunning of urban European influence. Levin and Kitty’s happy life in the countryside is repeatedly contrasted with Vronsky and Anna’s unhappy life in the city. Levin is connected with the earth; he knows the peasants and he works with them, while Vronsky only associates with aristocrats. Levin is earnest, provincial, and clumsy, while Vronsky is urbane, cosmopolitan, and suave. Kitty is simple, unreflecting, and pure-hearted, while Anna is well-read, sophisticated, and passionate. The most obvious symbol of Europeanization is the fateful railway. Anna and Vronsky meet in a train station; Vronsky confesses his love to Anna in another train station; and it is of course a train that ends Anna’s life. Levin, by contrast, catches sight of Kitty as he sits in the grass in his farm, while Kitty goes by in a horse-drawn carriage. Anna and Vronsky travel to Italy to see the sights, while for Levin even Moscow is painfully confusing and shallow. This contrast of urban Europe with rural Russia is mirrored in the contrast of atheism with belief. Like Dostoyevsky, Tolstoy attributed the growing disbelief in Christianity to the nefarious influence of the freethinking West. In Tolstoy’s view—and in this respect he’s remarkably close to Dostoyevsky—Russians were mistaken to gleefully import European technologies and modes of thought without paying attention to how appropriate these new arrivals were to Russia. Both Tolstoy and Dostoevsky wanted Russia to develop its own path into the future, a path that relied on an embrace of the Christian ethic, not an attempt to fill the vacuum left by religion with socialism and science. The final scene of this novel—where Levin renounces his old free-thinking ways and embraces Christianity—is the ultimate triumph of Russia over Europe in Levin’s soul. But this is where the book rings the most hollow for me. For here Tolstoy is attempting to put up one mode of life as ideal, while his prodigious ability to see the world from so many points of view makes us doubt whether there is such a thing as an ideal life or one right way of viewing the world. At least for me, Tolstoy's magnificent empathy is the real moral lesson I have taken away from this book. His insights into the minds and personalities of different people is staggering, and I can only hope to emulate this, in my own small way, as I fight the lifelong battle with my own ego."

        "text":"Anna Karenina is a remarkable story about society, faith and love. Included is a large range of emotions with some character flaws such as infidelity, unethicalness and selfishness. All the characters are intertwined with Anna in some form. Anna and the Count, Stephen and Dolly, Kitty and Levin the last being the most honest and likeable. Anna's first sighting of Count Vronsky is a string pulling of the heart with the railway station as the backdrop of their meeting. The Count finds Anna's beauty captivating. The love affair between the Count and Anna leads her to act in a way that is not befitting her rank in society. She forgets herself and tells Karenin she loves the Count. A strict moral code leaves Anna socially ostracized by society rules, she is shamed and shunned. Her love is very sad, for her the outcome is truly tragic. Her desires and changes in her life did not really give her physical or mental happiness, mostly suffering. Anna's story is paralleled by that of strong-minded Levin and charming Kitty, frivolous Stiva and loyal Dolly. Dolly finds Steven (charming yet non conforming in his life as a parent and not being responsible to fulfill his role as a husband and father) cheating on her. In yet she has the most ordinary of values in family. She finds great joy in the moments with her children her primary motivation in life giving her great meaning. Princess Kitty and Levin are quite charming and by far my favorite. He is older, their beliefs are different and yet they complement each other quite well. Levin is rejected at first as Kitty is smitten by another and Levin retreats to his farm and has many peasant families working with him. His bouts makes him search for the meaning of life which makes him skeptical in his beliefs. He eventually finds peace with God. He has loved Kitty always. Kitty is sensitive and compassionate. They marry. Life for them is good and their love is true. The story is beautifully written, rich and complex in morals. The novel is a cautionary tale of what not to do. This is not Anna's story it is Levin's and Tolstoy who are one in their moral and spiritual beliefs. “There are as many different kinds of love as there are different hearts” Leo Tolstoy in his timeless novel. Please see additional thoughts in comments."

        "text":"As a daughter of a Russian literature teacher, it seems I have always known the story of Anna Karenina: the love, the affair, the train - the whole shebang. I must have ingested the knowledge with my mother's milk, as Russians would say. My grandpa had an old print of a painting hanging in his garage. A young beautiful mysterious woman sitting in a carriage in wintry Moscow and looking at the viewer through her heavy-lidded eyes with a stare that combines allure and deep sadness. \"Who's that?\" I asked my grandpa when I was five, and without missing a beat he answered, \"Anna Karenina\" . Actually, it was \"A Stranger\" by Ivan Kramskoy (1883) - but for me it has always remained the mysterious and beautiful Anna Karenina, the femme fatale of Russian literature. (Imagine my childish glee when I saw this portrait used for the cover of this book in the edition I chose!) Yet, \"Anna Karenina\" is a misleading title for this hefty tome as Anna's story is just the tip of an iceberg, as half of the story is devoted to Konstantin Levin, Tolstoy's alter ego (Count Leo's Russian name was Lev. Lev --> Levin), preoccupied with Russian peasantry and its relationship to land, as well as torn over faith and his lack of it, Levin whose story continues for chapters after Anna meets her train. But Anna gives the book its name, and her plight spoke more to me than the philosophical dealings of an insecure and soul-searching Russian landowner, and so her story comes first. Sorry, Leo Levin. Anna's chapters tell a story of a beautiful married woman who had a passionate affair with an officer and then somehow, in her quest for love, began a downward spiral fueled by jealousy and guilt and societal prejudices and stifling attitudes. \" But I'm glad you will see me as I am. The chief thing I shouldn't like would be for people to imagine I want to prove anything. I don't want to prove anything; I merely want to live, to do no one harm but myself. I have the right to do that, haven't I? \" On one hand, there's little new about the story of a forbidden, passionate, overwhelming affair resulting in societal scorn and the double standards towards a man and a woman involved in the same act. Few readers will be surprised that it is Anna who gets the blame for the affair, that it is Anna who is considered \"fallen\" and undesirable in the society, that it is Anna who is dependent on men in whichever relationship she is in because by societal norms of that time a woman was little else but a companion to her man. There is nothing new about the sad contrasts between the opportunities available to men and to women of that time - and the strong sense of superiority that men feel in this patriarchial world. No, there is nothing else in that, tragic as it may be. \" Anything, only not divorce!\" answered Darya Alexandrovna. \"But what is anything?\" \"No, it is awful! She will be no one's wife, she will be lost! \" No, where Lev Tolstoy excels is the portrayal of Anna's breakdown, Anna's downward spiral, the unraveling of her character under the ingrained guilt, crippling insecurity and the pressure the others - and she herself - place on her. Anna, a lovely, energetic, captivating woman, full of life and beauty, simply crumbles, sinks into despair, fueled by desperation and irrationality and misdirected passion. \" And he tried to think of her as she was when he met her the first time, at a railway station too, mysterious, exquisite, loving, seeking and giving happiness, and not cruelly revengeful as he remembered her on that last moment. \" A calm and poised lady slowly and terrifyingly descends into fickle moods and depression and almost maniacal liveliness in between, tormented by her feeling of (imagined) abandonment and little self-worth and false passions which are little else but futile attempts to fill the void, the never-ending emptiness... This is what Tolstoy is a master at describing, and this is what was grabbing my heart and squeezing the joy out of it in anticipation of inevitable tragedy to come. \" In her eyes the whole of him, with all his habits, ideas, desires, with all his spiritual and physical temperament, was one thing—love for women, and that love, she felt, ought to be entirely concentrated on her alone. That love was less; consequently, as she reasoned, he must have transferred part of his love to other women or to another woman—and she was jealous. She was jealous not of any particular woman but of the decrease of his love. Not having got an object for her jealousy, she was on the lookout for it. At the slightest hint she transferred her jealousy from one object to another. \" Yes, it's the little evils, the multitude of little faces of unhappiness that Count Tolstoy knows how to portray with such sense of reality that it's quite unsettling - be it the blind jealousy of Anna or Levin, be it the shameless cheating and spending of Stiva Oblonsky, be it the moral stuffiness and limits of Arkady Karenin, the parental neglects of both Karenins to their children, the lies, the little societal snipes, the disappointments, the failures, the pervasive selfishness... All of it is so unsettlingly well-captured on page that you do realize Tolstoy must have believed in the famous phrase that he penned for this book's opening line: \"Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.\" Tolstoy is excellent at showing that, despite what we tend to believe, getting what you wanted does not bring happiness. \" Vronsky, meanwhile, in spite of the complete realization of what he had so long desired, was not perfectly happy. He soon felt that the realization of his desires gave him no more than a grain of sand out of the mountain of happiness he had expected. It showed him the mistake men make in picturing to themselves happiness as the realization of their desires. \" And yet, just like in real life, there are no real villains, no real unsympathetic characters that cause obstacles for our heroes, the villains whom it feels good to hate. No, everyone, in addition to their pathetic little ugly traits also has redeeming qualities. Anna's husband, despite appearing as a monster to Anna after her passionate affair, still is initially willing to give her the freedom of the divorce that she needs. Stiva Oblonsky, repulsive in his carelessness and cheating, wins us over with his gregarious and genuinely friendly personality; Anna herself, despite her outbursts, is a devoted mother to her son (at least initially). Levin may appear to be monstrous in his jealousy, but the next moment he is so overwhelmingly in love that it's hard not to forgive him. And I love this greyness of each character, so lifelike and full. And, of course, the politics - so easily forgettable by readers of this book that carries the name of the heroine of a passionate forbidden affair. The dreaded politics that bored me to tears when I was fifteen. And yet these are the politics and the questions that were so much on the mind of Count Tolstoy, famous to his compatriots for his love and devotion to peasants, that he devoted almost half of this thick tome to it, discussed through the thoughts of Konstantin Levin . Levin, a landowner with a strong capacity for compassion, self-reflection and curiosity about Russian love for land, as well as a striking political apathy, is Tolstoy's avatar in trying to make sense of a puzzling Russian peasantry culture, which failed to be understood by many of his compatriots educated on the ideas and beliefs of industrialized Europe. \" He considered a revolution in economic conditions nonsense. But he always felt the injustice of his own abundance in comparison with the poverty of the peasants, and now he determined that so as to feel quite in the right, though he had worked hard and lived by no means luxuriously before, he would now work still harder, and would allow himself even less luxury. \" I have to say - I understood his ideas more this time, but I could not really feel for the efforts of the devoted and kind landowner striving to understand the soul of Russian peasants. Maybe it's because I mentally kept fast-forwarding mere 50 years, to the Socialist Revolution of 1917 that would leave most definitely Levin and Kitty and their children dead, or less likely, in exile; the revolution which, as Tolstoy almost predicted, focused on the workers and despised the loved by Count Leo peasants, the revolution that despised the love for owning land and working it that Tolstoy felt was at the center of the Russian soul. But it is still incredibly interesting to think about and to analyze because even a century and a half later there's still enough truth and foresight in Tolstoy's musings, after all. Even if I disagree with so many of his views, they are still thought-provoking, no doubts about it. \" If he had been asked whether he liked or didn't like the peasants, Konstantin Levin would have been absolutely at a loss what to reply. He liked and did not like the peasants, just as he liked and did not like men in general. Of course, being a good-hearted man, he liked men rather than he disliked them, and so too with the peasants. But like or dislike \"the people\" as something apart he could not, not only because he lived with \"the people,\" and all his interests were bound up with theirs, but also because he regarded himself as a part of \"the people,\" did not see any special qualities or failings distinguishing himself and \"the people,\" and could not contrast himself with them. \" ======================== It's a 3.5 star book for me. Why? Well, because of Tolstoy's prose, of course - because of its wordiness and repetitiveness. Yes, Tolstoy is the undisputed king of creating page-long sentences (which I love, by the way - love that is owed in full to my literature-teacher mother admiring them and making me punctuate these never-ending sentences correctly for grammar exercises). But he is also a master of restating the obvious, repeating the same thought over and over and over again in the same sentence, in the same paragraph, until the reader is ready to cry for some respite. This, as well as Levin's at times obnoxious preachiness and the author's frequently very patriarchial views, was what made this book substantially less enjoyable than it could have been. -------- By the way, there is an excellent 1967 Soviet film based on this book that captures the spirit of the book quite well (and, if you so like, has a handy function to turn on English subtitles): first part is here , and the second part is here . I highly recommend this film. And even better version of this classic is the British TV adaptation (2000) with stunning Helen McCrory as perfect Anna and lovely Paloma Baeza as perfect Kitty."

        "text":"***Spoiler alert. If you have read this book, please proceed. If you are never going to read this novel (be honest with yourself), then please proceed. If you may read this novel, but it may be decades in the future, then please proceed. Trust me, you are not going to remember, no matter how compelling a review I have written. If you need Tolstoy talking points for your next cocktail party or soiree with those literary, black wearing, pseudo intellectual friends of yours, then this review will come in handy. If they pin you to the board like a bug over some major plot twist, that will be because I have not shared any of those. If this happens, do not despair; refer them to my review. I’ll take the heat for you. If they don’t know who I am, then they are, frankly, not worth knowing. Exchange them for other more enlightened intellectual friends.*** “He soon felt that the fulfillment of his desires gave him only one grain of the mountain of happiness he had expected. This fulfillment showed him the eternal error men make in imagining that their happiness depends on the realization of their desires.” Anna Arkadyevna married Alexei Alexandrovich Karenin, a man twenty years her senior. She dutifully produced a son for him and settled into a life of social events and extravagant clothes and enjoyed a freedom from financial worries. Maybe this life would have continued for her if she had never met Count Alexei Kirillovich Vronsky, but more than likely, her midlife crisis, her awareness of the passage of time, would have compelled her to seek something more. ”They say he’s a religious, moral, honest, intelligent man; but they don’t see what I’ve seen. They don’t know how he has been stifling my life for eight years, stifling everything that was alive in me, but he never once even thought that I was a living woman who needed love. They don’t know how he insulted me at every step and remained pleased with himself. Didn’t I try as hard as I could to find a justification for my life? Didn’t I try to love him… But the time has come, I’ve realized that I can no longer deceive myself, that I am alive, that I am not to blame if God has made me so that I must love and live. And what now? If he killed me, if he killed him, I could bear it all, I could forgive it all, but no, he….” Her husband was enamored with her, but then so was everyone who met her, male or female. Maybe he was too contented with their life together and, therefore, took their relationship for granted. He was two decades older, so the passions of romance didn’t burn with as hot a flame. She wanted passion from him even if it was to murder her lover and herself. Even if it was something tragic, she wanted something to happen, something that would make her feel... something. I couldn’t help thinking early on that the problem wasn’t with her husband, certainly nothing that a new lover could fix for very long. The same face was always going to greet her in the mirror. The same thoughts were always going to swim their way back to the surface. We can not mask the problems within ourselves by changing lovers. The mask will eventually slip, and all will be revealed. Ugly can be very pretty. Is there such a thing as being too beautiful? Can being so beautiful make someone cold, disdainful, and unable to really feel empathy or even connected to those around them? Her type of beauty is a shield that insulates her even as her insecurities swing the sword that stabs the hearts of those who despise her and those who love her. ”She was enchanting in her simple black dress, enchanting were her full arms with the bracelets on them, enchanting her firm neck with its string of pearls, enchanting her curly hair in disarray, enchanting the graceful, light movements of her small feet and hands, enchanting that beautiful face in its animation; but there was something terrible and cruel in her enchantment.” My favorite character in this epic was Konstantin (Kostya) Dmitrich Levin. He was a well meaning, wealthy landowner who, unusually for the times, went out and worked the land himself. He got his hands dirty enough that one could actually call him a farmer. He was led to believe by his friends and even the Shcherbatsky family that their youngest daughter, Kitty, would be an affable match for him. Kitty’s older sister Dolly was married to Stepan (Stiva) Arkadyich Oblonsky, who was the brother to Anna Karenina. Stiva was recently caught and forgiven for having a dalliance with a household staff, but no sooner was he out of that boiling water of that affair before he was having liaisons with a ballerina. This did lead me to believe that life would never be satisfying for either Stiva or his sister Anna because there was always going to be pretty butterflies to chase as the attractiveness of the one they had began to fade. Before Vronsky became gobsmacked by Anna, he was leisurely chasing after Kitty and leading her on just long enough for Kitty to turn Levin’s marriage proposal down flat. That was like catching a molotok (hammer) right between the eyes as a serp (sickle) swept Kostya off his feet. Interestingly enough, later in the book Levin met Anna Karenina, after he has married Kitty (you’ll have to read the book to discover how this comes about), and he was captivated by Anna. It was almost enough for me start chain smoking Turkish cigarettes or biting my nails down to the quick while I waited for the outcome. Substitute Anna for Jolene, and you’ll know what I was humming. ”She had unconsciously done everything she could to arouse a feeling of love for her in Levin, and though she knew that she had succeeded in it, as far as one could with regard to an honest, married man in one evening, and though she liked him very much, as soon as he left the room, she stopped thinking about him.” If she was irritated with Vronsky, one day maybe she would just seduce Levin for entertainment... because she could. I must say that I didn’t think much of Vronsky at the beginning of the novel, but as the plot progressed I started to sympathize with him. Tolstoy was brilliant at rounding out characters so our preconceived notions or the projections of ourselves that we place upon them are forced to be modified as we discover more about them. Levin had his own problems. He had been reading the great philosophers, looking for answers. He found more questions than answers in religion. He abandoned every lifeboat he climbed into and swam for the next one. ”Without knowing what I am and why I’m here, it is impossible for me to live. And I cannot know that, therefore I cannot live.” The problem that every reasonably intelligent person wrestles with is that no matter how successful we are, no matter how wonderful a life we build, or how well we take care of ourselves, we are going to die. It is irrefutable. Cemeteries don’t lie. Well, there is a lot of eternal lying down going on, but no duplicity. None of us are going to escape the reaper. No one is ascending on a cloud or going to the crossroads to make a deal with the Devil. We all have to come face to face with death, and we can’t take any of our bobbles, accolades, or power with us. So the question that Levin ended up asking himself, the Biggest question even beyond, why am I here? is: Why do anything? Without immortality, everything we attempt to do can seem futile. Some would make the case that we live on in our kids and grandkids. I say bugger to that. I want more time! Well, there are ways to be immortal, and one of them is to write a masterpiece like Anna Karenina that will live forever. By the end, I am ready to throttle Anna until her pretty eyes bug out of her head and her cheeks turn a vibrant pink, but at the same time, she seemed to be suffering from a host of mental disorders. She was so cut off from everyone and so disdainful of everyone. ”It was impossible not to hate such pathetically ugly people.” The “friends” she had had been ostracized from her by her own actions. I had to believe her loathing of people was a projection of how she felt about herself. She needed some time on Carl Jung’s couch, but he was a wee tot when this book was published. She needed to find some satisfaction in the ordinary and quit believing that a change in geography or in lovers was ever going to fix what was wrong with herself. She had such a destructive personality. One man tried to kill himself from her actions and another contemplated the act. She was maliciously vengeful when someone didn’t do something she wanted them to do; and yet, I couldn’t quite condemn her completely. Her feelings of being stifled were perfectly natural. We all feel that way at points in our lives. We feel trapped by the circumstances of our life. Her attempt to break free in the 1870s in Russian society was brave\/foolish. She sacrificed everything to chase a dream. The dream ate her. This book is a masterpiece, not just a Russian masterpiece but a true gift to the world of literature.

        "text":"welcome to...ANNA DECEMBERENINA! it's the start of the month (kinda). i've attempted a (reprehensible) pun on a book title (to everyone's chagrin). there is a notoriously long classic on my currently reading (ill-advisedly). you know what that means. IT'S PROJECT LONG CLASSIC TIME, the fan favorite in which i read a very long book divided up into little bits over the course of the month, and usually i drag elle along with me except this month i'm planning something truly nightmarish so i'm starting while she's asleep as an act of terror \/ peer pressure. let's do this. DAY 1: PAGES 1-25 my tbr review of this was \"sometimes i like to pretend i'm capable of reading thousand-page books. just for fun,\" and in this case that pretending includes starting 2 days early and doubling up eventually so that i can read in 25 page chunks. i'm cool like that. damn! that opening line! we are off to the races. DAY 2: PAGES 26-75 didn't even intend to make today my bonus day but this is just so readable. why didn't anyone tell me the 900 page classic from 150 years ago is unputdownable?? i fear i may adore all of these characters. DAY 3: 76-100 in a state of bliss right now in which i look forward to reading this every day but am relishing it so much that dividing it into sections works perfectly. DAY 4: 101-125 literally any book is doable in teeny chunks like this. i had negative free time (and a negative interest) today but boom. easy money. DAY 5: 126-150 the descriptions of emotions in this...sheesh. excellence. DAY 6: 151-175 and here we have the farming sections i've heard so much about... in truth if they're like this every time i can handle it. i like poetic descriptions of the descent of springtime as much as the next annoying girl. DAY 7: 176-200 i am absolutely indulging in vronsky's downfall here. finding pleasure in his every misfortune. his sadness and disappointment spark joy for me. hate that guy. DAY 8: 201-225 well jesus anna! we're only at the 25% mark, we can't act like this already! DAY 10: 226-250 i missed a day. i'm a nightmare person. now i have to see how many pages i can manage in, generously, 20 minutes. perhaps unsurprisingly it took 25 and i'm not caught up. DAY 11: PAGES 251-275 something fun that the universe and i are doing is that we've set up the last three weeks of the year so that i don't only have to finish 24 books, complete two projects, and remain active on seemingly 100 accounts, but i also have the busiest work week(s) i have had in (without exaggeration) 2 years. without the depressive episode that made the last time so fun. anyway i may never catch up on this. DAY 13: PAGES 276-300 guess who's behind. behind again. emma's behind. except she never caught up in the first place so now she's just...50 pages behind instead of 25. or i guess 75 since i haven't actually read any yet today. okay NOW 50. why is this book so good?? DAY 14: PAGES 301-350 well, well, well. look who decided to catch up. biiiiig farming chapters. DAY 15: PAGES 351-375 part four alert. we pray for mercy from agricultural labor bureaucracy content. and our prayers are heard <3 DAY 16: PAGES 376-400 KITTY AND LEVIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! wow i am so invested in this. even dozens of pages about farming and politics can't divest me. i am in it. DAY 17: PAGES 401-425 way, way, way too much is happening. it's the halfway point, people! this is no time for climaxes OR happily ever afters, let alone both! we have 400+ pages to cover! DAY 18: PAGES 426-450 i am uncomfortable with how high stakes everything is. THERE IS SO MUCH LEFT. WHEN I HEFT THIS UNWIELDY VOLUME I AM ONLY AT THE HALFWAY POINT EVEN STILL. I THINK. EVEN THOUGH I'VE BEEN SAYING THAT FOR SEEMINGLY DAYS. DAY 19: 451-475 honestly i care less about the Christian Art than the farming. sheesh. DAY 20: 476-500 it's the circleeee of lifeee... DAY 21: 501-525 what a moral quandary we find ourselves in! DAY 22: 526-550 okay phew, i'm back on board with being obsessed with anna. it makes me uncomfortable to not like a female character who is constantly committing moral wrongs...feels unnatural. part 5 done! DAY 23: 551-575 i'm internally titling this one twenty-five page chunk number 23: the tangled webs we weave. get it together, folks! it's like a sally rooney novel in here. DAY 24: 576-600 this too realistically conveyed the feeling of being clinically annoyed by a friend of a friend. i feel irritable now. DAY 28: 601-650 it's the most wonderful time of the year... read: it's actually december 26, meaning we have actually skipped right to day 28, and i am extremely behind just in time for the end of the year to be right around the corner. but i'm also behind on my other project , and i'm also behind on my actual literal reading challenge, so we're just going to ignore that for today. no time for worrying, only time for reading. actually read 50 pages anyway because i am perfect and infallible. DAY 31: PAGES 651-700 being very brave and reading 50 pages again and also pretending anna isn't on my damn nerves. GIRL STAND UP. we find ourselves heading into part 7. never mind. it's not hard to not be bugged by anna. she's the sh*t. DAY 32: PAGES 701-750 anna is so evil and kitty is so perfect. i love them both. DAY 33: PAGES 751-817 it appears it is time. hello and welcome to the last day of the anna karenina project. oh man. OVERALL not only was i intimidated by this book's length, i was sure i'd find it unconquerable. even as i started it and found it a pleasure, i was waiting for the other shoe to drop. it never did! i enjoyed this every day, through farming and politics and religion and art. readable and sweeping, stunning in its writing and its carrying across effortlessly of both the minutiae and the most important topics of life. it's insane how applicable, how of the moment this book is now, across languages and centuries. read it! i can't believe how long i put it off. rating: 4.5"

        "text":"As part of my reading challenge this year, I wanted to read at least one or two classics, and Anna Karenina was high on my list. It's considered by many to be one of the best novels ever written, and I've never read any Tolstoy. So even though it's a monster at more than 800 pages, I decided it's time I conquered it. The story starts out so strong, with what seems to be an insightful treatise into the family and romantic life of several characters, including title character Anna. The domestic strife, misunderstandings, affairs, and life in general of the Russian elite, when boiled down to its essentials, are not so different from what occupy people's attentions today. I found the initial chapters to be interesting, and was drawn towards the circle of people who would make up the main cast of the book. Then as the story progressed, things started to reach their natural conclusions, until about halfway through the book. At that point, I wish Tolstoy would have stopped because I found the second half to be more or less unnecessary. Everything had been resolved by then. But Tolstoy continued, and for me, the story just fell apart after that. The main characters, in particular Anna, having gotten what they wished for, started acting loony, for lack of a better word. The more their wishes came true, the unhappier they became. A good portion of the second half was devoted to Anna lamenting how her partner does not love her. Every time he goes somewhere, she would pounce on him as soon as he comes home, saying crazy things about how he must be thinking of other women and no longer of her. He would reassure her constantly of his love and unending devotion. She wouldn't listen, so when he inevitably would get frustrated, she took that as confirmation that he doesn't love her. She would leave messages for him not to bother her, and when he doesn't, she would take that as a sign that she is right. This went on for like 200 pages. I wanted to stab myself every time Anna showed up in a scene. It's hard to tolerate a book when you dislike the main character that much. I'm also a little uncomfortable that Tolstoy seems to portray women in his story as weak and mentally unstable, while the men are portrayed as high-thinking orators. The women would fly into tears and rages at the drop of a hat, stirring up domestic trouble while their men are out doing their jobs or hanging out with their buddies. The women also blushed uncontrollably when talking to any man who isn't their husband. Maybe this is just the way it was during Tolstoy's time and this book would have been seen as progressive, but as a modern woman reading it now, it makes me cringe so hard. Tolstoy also seems to have treated this book as a vehicle to get out whatever he wanted to say on a variety of topics, including farming techniques, local governments and elections, the meaning of life, religion, snipe shooting, duty and rights of citizens, etc. This book is full of philosophical musings on these topics and more. I don't mind when authors want to present interesting and tangential thoughts, but Tolstoy did it constantly and without filter. His ramblings would go on for many chapters, and were so unedited that it's essentially a stream of consciousness. I'm sure there are some good points in there, but it's so buried under pages of unreadable and irrelevant prattle that I couldn't find them. While these technical and philosophical ruminations are all throughout the book, they were much worse in the second half, taking up a significant portion of it. Reading this 800+ page tome has been an odyssey. I didn't find any of the characters to be particularly likable or charming. They were all rather silly, unstable, or full of themselves. To me, this is far from one of the best books I've ever read, though it's possible that back then, when there wasn't much to read or do for fun, this would have fulfilled that role. Now I can say I have read Anna Karenina , but that's about as much as I got out of it. ~~~~~~~~~~~~ ✧ Connect with me ✧ Instagram ✧"

        "text":"In the beginning, reading Anna Karenin can feel a little like visiting Paris for the first time. You’ve heard a lot about the place before you go. Much of what you see from the bus you recognize from pictures and movies and books. You can’t help but think of the great writers and artists who have been here before you. You expect to like it. You want to like it. But you don’t want to feel like you have to like it. You worry a little that you won’t. But after a few days, you settle in, and you feel the immensity of the place opening up all around you. You keep having this experience of turning a corner and finding something beautiful that you hadn’t been told to expect or catching sight of something familiar from a surprising angle. You start to trust the abundance of the place, and your anxieties that someone else will have eaten everything up before your arrival relax. (Maybe that simile reveals more about me than I’d like.) My favorite discovery was the three or four chapters (out of the book’s 239) devoted to, of all things, scythe mowing—chapters that become a celebratory meditation on physical labor. When I read those chapters, I felt temporarily cured of the need to have something “happen” and became as absorbed in the reading as the mowers are absorbed in their work. Of course, the book is about Anna and Vronsky and Levin and Kitty and Dolly and poor, stupid Stepan Arkadyich. It’s about their love and courtship and friendship and pride and shame and jealousy and betrayal and forgiveness and about the instable variety of happiness and unhappiness. But it’s also about mowing the grass and arguing politics and hunting and working as a bureaucrat and raising children and dealing politely with tedious company. To put it more accurately, it’s about the way that the human mind—or, as Tolstoy sometimes says, the human soul—engages each of these experiences and tries to understand itself, the world around it, and the other souls that inhabit that world. This book is not afraid to take up any part of human life because it believes that human beings are infinitely interesting and infinitely worthy of compassion. And, what I found stirring, the book’s fearlessness extends to matters of religion. Tolstoy takes his characters seriously enough to acknowledge that they have spiritual lives that are as nuanced and mysterious as their intellectual lives and their romantic lives. I knew to expect this dimension of the book, but I could not have known how encouraging it would be to dwell in it for so long. In the end, this is a book about life, written by a man who is profoundly in love with life. Reading it makes me want to live."

It was on a list of books that I'd been working my way through and, after seeing the size of it and the fact that 'War And Peace' was voted #1 book to avoid reading, I was reluctant to ever get started. But am I glad that I did. This is a surprisingly fast-moving, interesting and easy to read novel. The last of which I'd of never believed could be true before reading it, but you find yourself instantly engrossed in this kind of Russian soap opera, filled with weird and intriguing characters. The most notable theme is the way society overlooked mens' affairs but frowned on womens', this immediately created a bond between myself and Anna, who is an extremely likeable character. I thought it had an amazing balance of important meaning and light-heartedness. Let's just say, it's given me some courage to maybe one day try out the dreaded 'War And Peace'."

        "text":"WARNING: This is not a strict book review, but rather a meta-review of what reading this book led to in my life. Please avoid reading this if you're looking for an in depth analysis of Anna Karenina . Thanks. I should also mention that there is a big spoiler in here, in case you've remained untouched by cultural osmosis, but you should read my review anyway to save yourself the trouble. I grew up believing, like most of us, that burning books was something Nazis did (though, of course, burning Disco records at Shea stadium was perfectly fine). I believed that burning books was only a couple of steps down from burning people in ovens, or that it was, at least, a step towards holocaust. If I heard the words \"burning books\" or \"book burning,\" I saw Gestapo, SS and SA marching around a mountainous bonfire of books in a menacingly lit square. It's a scary image: an image of censorship, of fear mongering, of mind control -- an image of evil. So I never imagined that I would become a book burner. That all changed the day Anna Karenina, that insufferable, whiny, pathetic, pain in the ass, finally jumped off the platform and killed herself. That summer I was performing in Shakespeare in the Mountains , and I knew I'd have plenty of down time, so it was a perfect summer to read another 1,000 page+ novel. I'd read Count of Monte Cristo one summer when I was working day camps, Les Miserable one summer when I was working at a residential camp, and Shogun in one of my final summers of zero responsibility. A summer shifting back and forth between Marc Antony in Julius Caesar and Pinch, Antonio and the Nun (which I played with great gusto, impersonating Terry Jones in drag) in Comedy of Errors , or sitting at a pub in the mountains while I waited for the matinee to give way to the evening show, seemed an ideal time to blaze through a big meaty classic. I narrowed the field to two by Tolstoy : War and Peace and Anna Karenina . I chose the latter and was very quickly sorry I did. I have never met such an unlikable bunch of bunsholes in my life (m'kay...I admit it...I am applying Mr. Mackey's lesson. You should see how much money I've put in the vulgarity jar this past week). Seriously. I loathed them all and couldn't give a damn about their problems. By the end of the first part I was longing for Anna to kill herself (I'd known the ending since I was a kid, and if you didn't and I spoiled it for you, sorry. But how could you not know before now?). I wanted horrible things to happen to everyone. I wanted Vronsky to die when his horse breaks its back. I wanted everyone else to die of consumption like Nikolai. And then I started thinking of how much fun it would be to rewrite this book with a mad Stalin cleansing the whole bunch of them and sending them to a Gulag (in fact, this book is the ultimate excuse for the October Revolution (though I am not comparing Stalinism to Bolshevism). If I'd lived as a serf amongst this pack of idiots I'd have supported the Bolshies without a second thought). I found the book excruciating, but I was locked in my life long need to finish ANY book I started. It was a compulsion I had never been able to break, and I had the time for it that summer. I spent three months in the presence of powerful and\/or fun Shakespeare plays and contrasted those with a soul suckingly unenjoyable Tolstoy novel, and then I couldn't escape because of my own head. I told myself many things to get through it all: \"I am missing the point,\" \"Something's missing in translation,\" \"I'm in the wrong head space,\" \"I shouldn't have read it while I was living and breathing Shakespeare,\" \"It will get better.\" It never did. Not for me. I hated every m'kaying page. Then near the end of the summer, while I was sitting in the tent a couple of hours from the matinee (I remember it was Comedy of Errors because I was there early to set up the puppet theatre), I finally had the momentary joy of Anna's suicide. Ecstasy! She was gone. And I was almost free. But then I wasn't free because I still had the final part of the novel to read, and I needed to get ready for the show, then after the show I was heading out to claim a campsite for an overnight before coming back for an evening show of Caesar. I was worried I wouldn't have time to finish that day, but I read pages whenever I found a free moment and it was looking good. Come twilight, I was through with the shows and back at camp with Erika and my little cousin Shaina. The fire was innocently crackling, Erika was making hot dogs with Shaina, so I retreated to the tent and pushed through the rest of the book. When it was over, I emerged full of anger and bile and tossed the book onto the picnic table with disgust. I sat in front of the fire, eating my hot dogs and drinking beer, and that's when the fire stopped being innocent. I knew I needed to burn this book. I couldn't do it at first. I had to talk myself into it, and I don't think I could have done it at all if Erika hadn't supported the decision. She'd lived through all of my complaining, though, and knew how much I hated the book (and I am pretty sure she hated listening to my complaints almost as much). So I looked at the book and the fire. I ate marshmallows and spewed my disdain. I sang Beatles songs, then went back to my rage, and finally I just stood up and said \"M'kay it!\" I tossed it into the flames and watched that brick of a book slowly twist and char and begin to float into the night sky. The fire around the book blazed high for a good ten minutes, the first minute of which was colored by the inks of the cover, then it tumbled off its prop log and into the heart of the coals, disappearing forever. I cheered and danced and exorcised that book from my system. I felt better. I was cleansed of my communion with those whiny Russians. And I vowed in that moment to never again allow myself to get locked into a book I couldn't stand; it's still hard, but I have put a few aside. Since the burning of Anna Karenina there have been a few books that have followed it into the flames. Some because I loved them and wanted to give them an appropriate pyre, some because I loathed them and wanted to condemn them to the fire. I don't see Nazis marching around the flames anymore either. I see a clear mountain night, I taste bad wine and hot dogs, I hear wind forty feet up in the tops of the trees, I smell the chemical pong of toxic ink, and I feel the relief of never having to see Anna Karenina on my bookshelf again. Whew. I feel much better now."

        "text":"People are going to have to remember that this is the part of the review that is entirely of my own opinion and what I thought of the book, because what follows isn't entirely positive, but I hope it doesn't throw you off the book entirely and you still give it a chance. Now... my thoughts: I picked up this book upon the advice of Oprah (and her book club) and my friend Kit. They owe me hardcore now. As does Mr. Tolstoy. This book was an extremely long read, not because of it's size and length necessarily, but because of it's content. More often than not I found myself suddenly third a way down the page after my mind wandered off to other thoughts but I kept on reading... am I the only one with the ability to do that? You know, totally zoning out but continuing to read? The subject I passed over though was so thoroughly boring that I didn't bother going back to re-read it... and it didn't affect my understanding of future events taking place later on in the book. Leo Tolstoy really enjoys tangents. Constantly drifting away from the point of the book to go off on three page rants on farming methods, political policies and elections, or philosophical discussion on God. Even the dialogue drifted off in that sort of manner. Tolstoy constantly made detail of trifling matters, while important subjects that added to what little plot line this story had were just passed over. Here is a small passage that is a wonderful example of what constantly takes place throughout the book: \"Kostia, look out! There's a bee! Won't he sting?\" cried Dolly, defending herself from a wasp. \"That's not a bee; that's a wasp!\" said Levin. \"Come, now! Give us your theory,\" demanded Katavasof, evidently provoking Levin to a discussion. \"Why shouldn't private persons have that right?\" No mention of the wasp is made again. Just a small example of how Tolstoy focuses much more on philosophical thought, and thought in general, more than any sort of action that will progress the story further. That's part of the reason the story took so long to get through. The editing and translation of the version I got also wasn't very good. Kit reckons that that's part of the reason I didn't enjoy it as much, and I am apt to agree with her. If you do decide to read this book, your better choice is to go with the Oprah's Book Club edition of Anna Karenina . The characters weren't too great either and I felt only slightly sympathetic for them at certain moments. The women most often were whiny and weak while the men seemed cruel and judgemental more often than not. Even Anna, who was supposedly strong-willed and intelligent would go off on these irrational rants. The women were constantly jealous and the men were always suspicious. There's not much else to say that I haven't already said. There were only certain spots in the book which I enjoyed in the littlest, and even then I can't remember them. All in all I did not enjoy this book, and it earned the names Anna Crapenina and Anna Kareniblah. But remember this is just one girl's opinion, if it sounded like a book you might enjoy I highly advise going out to read it. Just try and get the Oprah edition."

        "text":"I am happy to have discovered this little marvel of deciphering nature and human passions, not in my 'Russian classics' around 20 years ago! At the time, I found significant serenity there, especially with Dostoievski. Today, regarding the question of maturity or only of work, I see something quite different: a magnificent painting of the human condition, both beautiful and tragic, with many ironies and even more finesse in the psychological analysis. In short, it is a masterpiece. As the title suggests, we follow the story of Anna Karenina, the wife of a high Russian dignitary; she is beautiful, healthy, joyful, and radiant until she meets passion, its complications, and its compromises. But, as the title does not indicate, there is also a whole gallery of portraits: her lover Vronsky, sometimes enthusiastic seducer, a sometimes responsible and wise man; her husband Karenina, all confided in his respectability but touched by his sufferings and his dignity; Levine, accurate literary double of Tolstoi according to the notice, the tortured, the pragmatist and the lover; Kitty, the simple, sweet and good woman, after having been a little brainless; the good-natured but well-intentioned parasite Oblonski; and so many others which will take us to the mundane and somewhat idle salons of Saint Petersburg, the revolutionary circles, the district assemblies or deep into the Russian countryside. What is extraordinary (or terrible, depending on which point of view you take) is that you find yourself in the characters and the situations. I am not a 19th-century Russian aristocrat engaged in a passionate affair. Yet I understand her, especially in her paradoxes, constant doubts, inability to stop the spiral of arguments, her interpretations distorted by anxiety, his exaltation, and his absolute love. So much more than the adulterous woman, it is the incarnation of the woman in love: if she had lived today, with the possibilities of divorce and professional activity for women, could she have loved Vronsky? And quietly? I'm not sure. And she will remain a tragic heroine with whom I especially would not like to identify! Although I don't look like the heroine, I am thrilled by my reading, which explains why this review is probably confusing."

        "text":"What is the most important thing about Anna Karenina? Is it the first line, \"Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way\"? This sounds so true but it isn't really. Is it that Anna experiences much more intolerance for her unfaithfulness and leaving her husband than does her brother who screws around like a dog? Is it Konstantin Levin's attempts to marry into the aristocracy and his problem with religion? Or is the entire story just Tolstoy's way of seducing the reader into reading the political nub of the story, the feudalism that was at the heart of all politics, morality and social position. I enjoyed the book when I read it, but I have to say I skimmed over a lot of the politics and did wonder which in Tolstoy's heart is the story he wanted to tell, love stories or political ones? How I came to read Anna Karenina, appendicitis and an air hostess ending with a rotten tomato. I read this book when I was 13. I had a test on it in two days and hadn't even opened it so I said I had stomach ache and went to the school sick room. This was a tall, narrow room with a tiny window about 8' up and painted with shades of olive green and aubergine (eggplant). If you weren't sick going in.. those colours.... But I was away in Russia with Anna, her husband Alexei and Count Vronsky whom I swooned over. In the early hours of the morning, I really had stomach ache. At 4 a.m. I had an emergency appendectomy in a nursing home with an operating theatre. I was very sick indeed and in bed for weeks. Had I brought it on myself? Never mind. Next day three things happened, one bad and one good and one fantastic. My period came on for the first time. I was a Woman! Yes! I told my mother and my grandmother leaned over from the visitor chair and slapped my face very hard, \"That's to take the shock of the blood away.\" She said. Then the good. My mother said I had been waiting for this day and she really let loose at my grandmother. They had a very fierce row. It was wonderful. My mother didn't love me and she never ever defended me or involved herself with me in any way. Memories of being slapped herself I suppose. My mother was very pretty and was the first of her family to be married. On her wedding day, her mother slapped her face as she put the veil on her. \"Ruth should have been married first, not you.\" Ruth was her much less attractive and zealously-religious older sister. (She mellowed). Everyone else in the nursing home was old except for an air hostess of 21. She didn't have a private room and didn't like being with the old people so would wander into mine to sit and read and eat all my chocolates, of which I had endless boxes. She brought her books - Jane Austen, Charlotte Bronte, Mrs. Gaskell and Zola. So for nearly three weeks my days were filled with reading, talking about books with my new friend and eating chocolates all day long. I was actually thrown out of the nursing home. The food there was terrible. One lunchtime there was something forgettable and salad. The tomato was perfect-looking but mushy, almost liquid so I threw it out of the window and it landed on one of the nuns who was beside herself with anger. I didn't care, my friend had left a few days before, left her books for me too in exchange for some fancy ribbon-bowed boxes of chocolates. We wrote for a bit, were penpals, but eventually that died. The age gap and where we were in our lives was too far apart. But I will always remember her and the fabulous books she introduced me too. Thank you Helen. I will never forget Anna Karenina, apart from Tolstoy's political rants and plight of the peasants etc, the book was a pure gold, convoluted love affair. It was like all the best books are, total immersion in another world populated by real people whose lives outside of those described you could easily imagine, not just \"well-drawn characters\". Austen, Bronte, Mrs. Gaskell and Zola were just as good, all of them worlds I lived in when I read their books. Review 1\/2020 Rewritten 15th Jan 2020 to include more about the book."

        "text":"I don’t know where to start...I guess at the beginning. “All happy families resemble one another, but each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.” -Leo Tolstoy Exactly one month ago, scared out of my mind, I opened up this book and read that first line. After that it was all over for me because I was completely HOOKED!!! I had to fight with myself about putting the book down so I could get enough sleep. I brought it with me everywhere in case there was a spare moment when I could escape into its pages. This is one of the most truly remarkable stories I’ve ever read, and I’ve read a great many books!! Going in, I knew that this story would mainly be about two characters, Anna (of course) and Levin. I went in thinking that Anna’s tragical tale of woe would be my preferred point of view. I also knew that there were chapters dedicated to Levin’s agricultural pursuits, and I honestly thought that they would bore me and slow down my reading pace. Oh how wrong past Carolyn was!! The exact opposite happened, Levin’s storyline was the one that captured my heart, as well as his precious love for mowing fields with a scythe. Everytime I read about Levin my heart would melt into a great big puddle. His aspirations for simply wanting to be with the one woman he loves, and living as a humble farmer just made me feel and fall for him all at the same time. Watching his character development from the beginning of the book to the end was incredibly moving and brilliantly written. Reading this story felt like watching a gifted musician compose a grand symphony. Anna, oh my poor Anna! My feelings and sympathies towards her tended to fluctuate while I read. In the beginning, I felt sorrow for her being in a loveless marriage. Then, when love did come walking in, he brought her inevitable fate along with him. I wanted her and Vronsky to be happy together and for them to take pride in their love for eachother. The slow and sad progression of their bond was something that I thought about deeply. Their choices towards the children involved left me feeling quite uneasy. The more I read the more tension I felt coming off the pages. This all culminated in the very prolific “train scene.” Ironically, I read the train scene riding the train myself, on my way back to NYC. As I read about the approaching train, my own train’s wheels were squeaking and the car itself started rocking. I was completely and utterly transported into the story, while being elevated by my own surroundings. I had to stop reading and collect myself because I could feel my face growing red and my eyes start to water. It was a reading experience I will never forget. To read that exact scene on a train myself was indescribable. That’s when I really knew that this book was unlike any other I’ve ever read. I could feel every word, sensation, noise, and breath while reading, not only that scene, but all of them. Anna’s fate although heartbreaking was raw and honest, and I don’t think this book would have remained one of the most profound books ever written if her destiny was changed. Along with our two brilliantly written main characters, the way each character’s story weaved together felt like watching someone hand weave silk threads into a beautiful piece of fabric. Each page felt like a gift that I never wanted to stop opening. The amount of times I read a particular line and was then entirely moved is innumerable. It felt like Tolstoy put his whole heart into each and every line. One of my absolute favorite lines is from the point of view of Levin (of course), “He tried not to look long at her, as if she were the sun, yet he saw her, like the sun, even without looking.” *insert crying noises here* Anne Karenina has become one of (if not) my favorite classics ever. It is tied neck and neck with Jane Eyre for first place, but it is so hard to say. It’s impossible to compare books because each one is different from the other, and that’s what makes this thing called reading so much fun!! I have so much more to say, but I don’t think any configuration of words will ever fully articulate how much I love and adore this book. The fact that this story is over makes me feel quite empty inside, which was half the reason why I practically cried my eye’s out when I read the final page. Yet, the most uplifting aspect of a well written story, is that once the author and their characters make their way inside your heart, there they will remain."

        "text":"\"Leo Tolstoy would meet hatred expressed in violence by love expressed in self-suffering.\" —Mahatma Gandhi Through reading this praiseworthy classic, I have been forced to recalibrate my previously unreliable view of this celebrated author. You see, I was force-fed Tolstoy at college (his writing, not his flesh, silly! Mine wasn't a college for cannibals!) and at the time only carried War and Peace under one arm so I might appear cleverer than I actually was. So, how amazed was I that Anna K has shown me the fun side to Leo T? He is slyly hilarious. How did I not know this? Please note that I haven't read this novel in Russian Cyrillic. I acknowledge that my perception owes a great deal to the amazing interpretive work of the translators, but let's imagine that we in the West have enjoyed his work as the great man intended. The title is something of a misnomer and doesn't do justice to an endearing love story that also captures the disparity between city and country life in 19th-century Russia. For a start, Anna K isn't the star of the show. That billing falls to our anti-hero, Konstantin Dmitrich Levin, a socially awkward, highly intelligent loner who considers himself to be an ugly fellow with no redeemable qualities. Despite being weighed down by all this existential angst, he worships Kitty Shcherbatskaya, an attractive young princess whom he believes to be out of his league. Kitty is described as being \"as easy to find in a crowd as a rose among nettles.\" Tolstoy goes to great lengths to make us understand the inner workings of Levin's mind (For Tolstoy, read Levin: they are one and the same). Levin's love rival, raffishly handsome Count Vronsky, couldn't be more dissimilar. He is socially adept and careful not to offend, whereas Levin could probably start an argument with a goldfish. What a fabulous read this is. Tolstoy's levity and perspicacity shine from every page and the badinage between the main characters is exquisitely observed. He does though have an idiosyncratic way of writing: adjectives are thickly laid on with a trowel and he loves to use repetition to emphasise a point. Anna herself is fascinating, and to affirm just how fascinating she is, Tolstoy employs the word fascinating seven times in one paragraph! Look! I've even started doing it myself! How fascinating! When not beating you about the head with repetition, the Russian master can do majestic descriptive imagery as well as anyone. One simple scene, where Kitty collapses into a low chair, her ball gown rising about her like a cloud, was just perfectly captured. This is a wonderful story of fated love and aristocratic hypocrisy. Tolstoy uses Levin as his political mouthpiece to rail against the ills of late 19th-century Russia, and the author's philosophy of non-violent pacifism also directly influenced none other than Mahatma Gandhi. Anna Karenina is often cited as 'one of the best books ever written'. So who am I to disagree?"

        "text":"Team Levin Anna Karenina is spectacularly well written, with short paragraphs and chapters, that it doesn’t remind me of stuffy writing from 1878. This tome is my second foray into Leo Tolstoy’s work, my first being a short novel, The Death of Ivan Ilych. “Honesty is only a negative qualification,” he said. – Anna Karenina by Leo Tolstoy At the center of this story is Anna Karenina who is a charming, married woman who falls in love with Count Vronsky (definitely not her husband). It also focuses on Dolly and Stepan Oblonsky as well as Kitty and Levin. This book is written in such a style where you can “hear” the characters’ thoughts, and it highlighted the difference in how men and women are treated in society. And if it was just the romance and societal tension, I would have rated this book 5 stars. However, there was a lot of commentary about peasants and religion. As I am not an expert in Russian history\/politics of 1878, this part was a bit over my head. I felt like I needed a wise sage to guide me through these parts. This book is interesting enough and worthy of a reread, but I would have to rope in a person a bit wiser than myself to help me along.

        "text":"Not since I read The Brothers Karamazov have I felt as directly involved in characters' worlds and minds. Fascinating. I was hooked on Anna Karenina from the opening section when I realized that Tolstoy was brilliantly portraying characters' thoughts and motivations in all of their contradictory, complex truth. However, Tolstoy's skill is not just in characterization--though he is the master of that art. His prose invokes such passion. There were parts of the book that took my breath because I realized that what I was reading was pure feeling: when we realize that Anna is no longer pushing Vronsky away, when Levin proposes to Kitty, and later when Levin thinks about death. The book effectively threw a shroud over me and sucked me in--I almost missed my train stop a couple of times. That being said, there were some parts that were difficult to get through. I felt myself slowing down in Part VI. I was back in through the remainder of the book once I hit Part VII, but I understand how the deep dive into politics and farming can be off-putting. Still, in those chapters Tolstoy's characters are interacting, and it's incredible to see them speak and respond to one another. It's not only worth the trouble, but deep down, it's no trouble at all. It's to be savored, and sometimes we must be forced to slow down and think about the characters' daily life as they navigate around in their relationships. A word about this translation. When I was in college I attempted to read the Constance Garnett translation. I didn't stop because it was awful (I think finals came up, then the holidays, then more classes, etc.). However, I never really felt like the words were as powerful as they should have been. Years later, the only image that stuck in my mind was of Levin meeting Kitty at the ice skating rink. I just never really entered the world of Anna Karenina , perhaps my fault more than anything. However, the diction and sentence construction in Pevear and Volokhonsky's translation is poetic and justifies the title \"masterpiece.\" Through this translation I grew to appreciate Tolstoy not just because he told good, philosophical stories, but because he could do so with utmost subtletly and compactness--yes, I think Tolstoy is concise. Each word has its place. Understandably, many are unwilling to give themselves to this book. Many expect it to do all of the work. But it's an even better read because if the reader works, the experience of reading this book is incredible."

Moreover Tolstoy does not spare on social socialism and describes the beginnings of communism, deals with such existential themes as birth and death and the meaning of life. Tolstoy’s narrative art and his narrative charm are at the highest level. He also seems like a close observer of human passions, feelings and emotions.

        "text":"As someone who loves classic literature, Anna Karenina is probably the most substantial novel I’ve ever read - 1 of Leo Tolstoy ’s 3 monumental masterpieces. Despite the title, Anna actually is not the sole protagonist. The novel follows 2 main storylines: 1 centered on Anna, the other on Levin. Through the people around them - their relationships, emotions, and choices - Tolstoy paints a vivid and profound portrait of 19th-century Russian aristocratic life. The story revolves around love and marriage: Anna and her husband Alexei, Anna and Vronsky, Levin and Kitty, Stiva and Dolly. Through Levin’s evolving thoughts, Tolstoy explores his views on life, love, society, and the kind of family life he admires. These characters’ lives are intricately woven together, reflecting the complexities of a class on the brink of decline. Potential Spoilers Ahead! Anna is portrayed as nearly perfect - beautiful, graceful, intelligent, cultured, and morally upright. Even judged by aristocratic standards, she’s exceptional. If not for the emotional void that Vronsky awakens in her, she would’ve been universally admired. Tolstoy never diminishes her outward elegance, even when her soul is falling apart. She’s not someone to condemn - she’s a tragic figure who evokes deep sympathy and frustration, which we end up projecting onto the people and society around her. She’s no longer young, a devoted mother to her 8-year-old son, with a refined taste in art and literature. She’s charming, magnetic in social settings, and even Levin - newly married - finds himself drawn to her. Morally, she’s compassionate and kind, caring for a suicidal worker, her sister-in-law, and her nieces and nephews. Even other women, despite their jealousy, can’t bring themselves to dislike her. But all of this unravels with a single glance from Vronsky on a train. Her emotional world begins to crack, and her suppressed desires explode. Her pain stems from her husband’s coldness and hypocrisy. On the surface, her marriage looks ideal - Alexei is powerful and successful. But he’s obsessed with status and work, neglecting Anna entirely. Their relationship is polite but hollow. Anna sees him as a well-oiled machine - efficient, respectable, but soulless. He provides everything materially, but emotionally, he drains her. A woman is like a flower, needs emotional nourishment. Without it, she either wilts like a rose or grows wild like a poppy - beautiful but poisonous. And what about Vronsky? He’s not a villain. He falls for Anna’s beauty and gives up everything for her - his career, his reputation, even his family. He’s talented, generous, admired, and artistic. He’s like a proud, graceful stallion, loved by all. But like someone enchanted by a poppy’s beauty and addicted to its poison, he loses himself in Anna. He tries to build a life with her, even attempts suicide twice. Yet people still blame him for the tragedy. Alexei, Anna’s husband, isn’t entirely blameless either. He’s emotionally detached, and when he discovers Anna’s affair, he becomes even colder, refusing to divorce her and trapping everyone - Anna, Vronsky, their son - in a moral cage. He’s incapable of love, but he does experience deep pain. At 1 point, he even shows compassion for Anna’s child with Vronsky. In a way, his life is destroyed too. Anna and Vronsky face not just social judgment but internal torment. Anna knows her overwhelming emotional needs are consuming her. She tries to break things off after giving birth to their daughter, clinging to her son as her last anchor. But after reconnecting with Vronsky, she spirals into obsession. Her love becomes insatiable - like a poppy needing endless sun and water. Even their child becomes a source of resentment. Not even Italy’s beauty and art can soothe her. Her melancholy and emotional hunger become a burden for Vronsky. They drain each other, unable to stop. Their dream of love lasts less than a year. They return to aristocratic society, and Vronsky tries to build a new life, hoping marriage will fix things. But Anna’s paranoia and emotional intensity make that impossible. Their final fight ends with Anna’s suicide. Vronsky, shattered, heads to the front lines. Thankfully, there’s Levin. He’s Tolstoy ’s semi-autobiographical character, and he brings warmth and depth to the novel. If Anna’s story gives the book its tragic weight, Levin’s journey elevates it to something truly profound. Levin is ordinary - no dramatic highs or lows. He’s not cynical like his brother Nikolai, nor brilliant like Sergei. He’s awkward, skeptical of aristocratic games, uninterested in politics, and doubtful of religion. He’s more like a humble landowner than a nobleman. He cares about his farm and his workers, joins them in labor, and wants to improve their lives. But even his efforts fail. His intellectual pursuits stall after marriage, and he’s often overwhelmed by life’s demands. He’s not young or charming. He’s rejected by Kitty, crushed emotionally, and retreats into hard labor to cope. He’s shy, naive, and clueless about love and marriage. Even after marrying Kitty, he doubts his happiness. He’s unprepared for everything - wedding plans, pregnancy, childbirth. Without Kitty’s support, his life would be chaos. He never reforms his estate or finishes his book. His only success is marrying Kitty, but even that joy is quickly replaced by everyday struggles. The novel ends here, almost abruptly. Anna and Vronsky’s story has closure, but Levin’s doesn’t. He’s still searching, still thinking, and his final realization doesn’t offer a clear philosophical answer. But maybe that’s the point. Levin’s ordinariness makes the novel extraordinary. He’s relatable, real. We can step into his shoes, feel his emotions, and follow his evolving thoughts. He doesn’t chase greatness, but he works hard. He doesn’t envy status, but he builds genuine friendships. He’s not wealthy, but he’s happy. He’s simple, but thoughtful. He avoids flashy clubs and enjoys honest labor. He’s timid in love, but wins Kitty’s heart. Everyone around him - Stiva, Dolly, Nikolai, Sergei, Anna, Vronsky - finds comfort or connection in Levin. Even with his flaws, people love him. He lacks the typical aristocratic traits, but he embodies the virtues that truly matter. Tolstoy uses Levin to show that the qualities society often overlooks - honesty, humility, kindness - are the ones that lead to real happiness. The aristocrats seem enviable, but their misery is painfully real. Through Levin, Tolstoy critiques both the old nobility and modern capitalist values that chase wealth, status, and pleasure at the cost of morality, happiness, and human connection. Levin’s fear of death after Nikolai’s passing leads him to existential despair. He feels like a fleeting bubble in the vast universe. Science and philosophy fail to comfort him. In the end, he turns to the religion he once abandoned. Though disproven by science, faith gives him meaning - more than any theory ever could. So if philosophy is the highest peak of the rational world, then in the emotional world, nothing stands taller than love. Love is this blazing, sincere, selfless feeling that cuts straight to the heart. It’s pure and precious - often overwhelming, yet hard to put into words. It’s like the “Zen” in a monk’s heart - only truly understood through experience, passed from soul to soul. Funny thing is, those people who talk about love the most are often the ones who’ve never truly experienced it. These so-called “experts” end up describing something that’s not love at all - more like a messy mix of lust, desire, ethics, money, logic, and analysis. It’s like a stir-fry of everything but the real thing. And when love loses its true face, it becomes hard to swallow. So yeah, I know this piece I’m writing is probably flawed and flimsy, but I’m still putting it out there - call it a bit of dreamy rambling. Love, marriage, and family - they’re not the same thing. Love is deeply personal. It’s emotional, not rational. It’s free, untamed, and rooted in human nature. You can suppress it, but you can’t train it. That’s why Anna and Vronsky’s love hits so hard. It’s fiery and unstoppable. Anna gives up her family and even her life for love. Vronsky gives up his future and goes against high society for it. Real love is like that - it defies social judgment, breaks through chaos, ignores rules and expectations. It crosses cities and countrysides just to say, “I love you.” True love doesn’t care about ethics or moral codes. In rejecting those, it stays true to the human heart and protects the purity and freedom love deserves. Marriage and family, though? Totally different. Marriage is more like a social contract between 2 people. Family brings in material concerns. Unlike love, which is emotional and personal, marriage and family are social and rational. That’s why they’re bound by ethics and norms - they’re about stability, not passion. Take Oblonsky and Dolly, for example. Their marriage revolves around property, income, kids, chores. Romance fades, passion wears down, but what matters is that Oblonsky comes back after cheating, and Dolly stays after her rage. What matters is compromise, realism, and responsibility. Sadly, we often confuse love with marriage - like 1 must lead to the other, or that marriage must be built on love. But their very nature hints at a deep conflict: individual vs. society, freedom vs. rules, emotion vs. reason. When these collide, tragedy often follows. That conflict is clearest in Anna and Vronsky’s story. Anna, a married woman, falls for Vronsky. What could’ve been a fleeting affair turns into a full-blown relationship - living together, a difficult childbirth, a child out of wedlock. They openly challenge Anna’s marriage, society’s moral boundaries, and every social norm. And why? Because they love each other deeply and want to build a life together. Their love becomes a clash between human emotion and societal rules. That clash proves impossible to resolve. Anna, crushed by social rejection and Vronsky’s growing coldness, chooses to end her life. Vronsky, heartbroken, heads to the battlefield. Even if love ultimately loses to societal pressure, does that mean their love wasn’t real? Can we really sit on our moral high horses and judge people who stood on the peak of human emotion? Honestly, anyone with a shred of humanity would struggle to make such a cold judgment. Anna and Vronsky’s love was genuine. It had nothing to do with marriage or being a “third party.” I think anyone who meets their own “Anna” or “Vronsky” would feel their heart skip a beat. The difference is, some act on it - like Anna and Vronsky - and some bury it deep inside, like those of us clinging to moral superiority. So no, their love isn’t something to condemn. The real issue is that they tried to turn that love into a marriage, into a family. That’s where society steps in, and judgment begins. That’s the tragedy. Compare that to Levin and Kitty’s relationship - it’s a quieter kind of conflict. Their love is clearly aimed at marriage. Tolstoy doesn’t dwell much on their romance - it basically starts with Levin’s proposal. Their wedding, though, is one of the novel’s most beautiful moments, and their ending is sweet and enviable. But it makes me wonder, right: was Levin’s love real? Did he marry because he loved Kitty, or did he love her because he wanted to marry? Levin’s attention shifts between 3 sisters - first the eldest, then the second, and finally Kitty. So it’s fair to question whether he truly loved her. It feels like he designed a family first, then picked someone to fill the role. His goal was so clear, it almost seems like he loved himself more than anyone else. He wanted a companion, and mistook that for love. That’s what sets him apart from Vronsky. Levin is steady and romantic, but he never experiences the kind of all-consuming passion Vronsky does. And that passion - that overwhelming, selfless love - is what makes great love so unforgettable. Still, Levin and Vronsky are alike in one way: they both mix love with marriage and family. Levin loses true love for the sake of marriage. Vronsky loses marriage because of true love. In that sense, both are tragic. I often imagine - what if Anna and Vronsky had stopped at mutual attraction, or just one magical night? Maybe then their love would’ve stayed pure, untouched by the weight of expectations. Maybe that first meeting at the train station would’ve been their most cherished memory. Or what if they had escaped judgment and married like Levin and Kitty? Would they, years later, end up like Oblonsky and Dolly - romance gone, stuck in routine? Love is beautiful because it’s pure. But that purity makes it fragile. Even the most passionate love can’t survive the grind of daily life, let alone the crushing weight of moral expectations. The most heartbreaking moment in the novel isn’t Anna’s final leap - it’s Vronsky trying to remember their happiest times, only to feel those memories poisoned forever. Maybe love should just be love. Not about marriage. Not about family. Not about possession or permanence. Maybe it’s the distance between us and the stars that makes them eternal. 5 \/ 5 stars (Really sorry - I think I rambled on for way too long. But that’s what happens when the book I’m reading is that good)."

        "text":"A few months ago I read Anna in the Tropics, a Pulitzer winning drama by Nilo Cruz. Set in 1920s Florida, a lector arrives at a cigar factory to read daily installments of Anna Karenina to the workers there. Although the play takes place in summer, the characters enjoyed their journey to Russia as they were captivated by the story. Even though it is approaching summer where I live as well, I decided to embark on my own journey through Leo Tolstoy's classic nineteenth century classic novel. Although titled Anna Karenina after one of the novel's principle characters, this long classic is considered Tolstoy's first 'real' novel and his take on a modernizing country and on people's lives within it. The novel begins as Anna Karenina arrives in Moscow from Petersburg to help her brother and sister-in-law settle a domestic dispute. Members of Russia's privileged class, Darya \"Dolly\" Alexandrovna discovers that her husband Stepan Arkadyich \"Stiva\" Oblonsky has engaged in an affair with one of their maids. Affairs being a long unspoken of part of upper class life, Dolly desires to leave her husband along with their five children. Anna pleads with Dolly to reconcile, and the couple live a long, if not tenuous, marriage, overlooking each other's glaring faults. While settling her brother's marriage, Anna is reminded of her own unhappy marriage, setting the stage for a drama that lasts the duration of the novel. Tolstoy sets the novel in eight parts and short chapters with three main story lines, allowing for his readers to move quickly through the plot. In addition to Stiva and Dolly, Tolstoy introduces in part one Dolly's sister Kitty Shcherbatsky, a young woman of marriageable age who is forced to choose between Count Vronsky and Konstantin Dmitrich Levin. At a ball in Kitty's honor, Vronsky is smitten with Anna, temporarily breaking Kitty's heart. Even though Levin loves Kitty with his whole heart, Kitty refuses his offer in favor of Vronsky, and falls into a deep depression. Levin, seeing the one love of his life reject him, vows to never marry. Anna becomes a fallen woman and rejects her husband in favor of Vronsky, fathering his child, leaving behind the son she loves. Even those closest to her, including family members, are appalled. A G-D fearing woman in a religious society is supposed to view marriage as sacred. Yet, Anna does not value her loved ones' advice and chooses to live with Vronsky. Despite a comfortable, upper class life, Anna is in constant internal turmoil. Spurned by a society that clings to its institutions as marriage and the church, Anna chooses love yet isolation from all but Vronsky and their daughter. Her ex-husband is viewed as a strict adherent to the law, cold, and unsympathetic, and will not grant a divorce. Even though Anna is clearly in the wrong, Tolstoy has his readers sympathizing with her situation, rooting for a positive outcome. He brings to light the plight of lack of women's rights, especially in regard to divorce, and has one hoping that Russia changes her ways as she modernizes. If Anna's situation sheds light on the worst of Russian society and Dolly's reveals its stagnation, then Kitty, who later marries Levin, shows how the country begins to modernize. Kostya and Kitty marry for love, rather than gains in society. Believed by many to be Tolstoy's alter ego, Levin is an estate farmer who is well aware of the rights of his tenant farmers called muzhiks. Along with his brother Sergei Ivanovich, Levin works toward agrarian reform. Both men, Sergei Ivanovich especially, is swept up in the communist ideals that are beginning to form, in rejection of the tsarist governing of the country. Tolstoy diverges pages at a time to farming reforms and one can see in these pages his own beliefs for the future of Russia in the late 19th century. Through the three principle couples: Stiva and Dolly, Vronsky and Anna, and Levin and Kitty, Tolstoy presents the old, changing, and new Russia. Having Levin introduce farming mechanisms from the west and Vronsky participate in a Slavic war, Tolstoy presents a Russia that is no longer completely isolated. He reveals how communism begins to shape up as farmers are no longer happy as tenants and many privileged classes adhere to newer values. Meanwhile, through Dolly, Anna, and Kitty, Tolstoy also presents how a woman's role in this society changes, including schooling and her place in a marriage. As the twentieth century nears, Russian life is no longer set in antiquated ways. Had I not read a drama set in the tropics, I most likely would not have journeyed to 19th century Russia. I enjoyed learning about Leo Tolstoy's views on life there and how he saw late 19th century Russia as a changing society. I found the plight his title character depressing while reading about Levin and Kitty to be uplifting as Russia moves toward the future. Tolstoy's words are accessible in spite of the novel's length, a testament to the stellar translation done by Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky. A true classic, I enjoyed my time with the characters in Anna Karenina, and rate Tolstoy's premier novel 5 shining stars."

        "text":"Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way. This opening sentence sums up the main theme of this great work: family relationships. Tolstoy has chosen three families to work on the different aspects of this theme. The first family is that of Anna and the second family is that of Levin and Kitty. The third and a little less prominent than the other two is the family of Dolly and Stepan. Anna's story, for which the book is well known and loved, occupies a greater part of the book. Anna is young. Having married a man nearly twenty years elder to her at a very young age, Anna is not exposed to the feelings of love and passion a woman would feel for a man. Alexey, an ambitious man who treats her wife to every material comfort, fails to give Anna the care, attention, and love which she needed. Anna's later reference to her husband as \"he is not a man but a machine...\" shows how unfeeling he has been towards her. The comforter and saviour of her life was his son, Seryozha, for whom she had devoted her life while being a dutiful wife. But the fateful meeting with Count Vronsky changes her path of life. Anna's realization of what is missing in her life coupled with the newborn feelings of love and passion for Vronsky takes her through a destructive and tragic path. The widespread view on Anna's story is that of a woman's infidelity in carrying out an adulterous affair. While this view is correct, there is more to it than that of mere adultery. The relationship between the threesome is complex. Anna is bound by duty and honour to her husband while she passionately loves Vronsky. She is torn between wronging her husband and her desire to live happily with the man she loves. Moreover, Anna is worried about the consequences that her action would have on her relationship with her precious son. Her son and Vronsky are the love of her life but one excludes the other. For this reason, she refuses a divorce thus willingly demoting her to a humiliating position by living as an \"immoral woman\" in the eyes of the society. Her self-sacrifice of character simply to retain her relationship with her son is to be admired and pitied. And though at times, Anna was infuriating, the story is written in such a way that it was difficult to blame her. This is why Anna has become a tragic heroine. Vronsky and Alexey (either could be seen as the villain in this tragic story according to the personal views of the reader) on the other hand are both victims in their own right. Both are to be sympathized, perhaps Vronsky a little more than Alexey, as he gave up all his life ambitions for his love for Anna. In contrast to Anna's tragic story, a \"happy\" conventional family is provided by Levin and Kitty. Despite the differences of character, temperament, views, and beliefs Levin and Kitty manage to carry on a successful and loving marriage. The family relationship between Levin and Kitty is modeled on Tolstoy's own convictions on marriage. The relationship between Dolly and Stepan comes between these two extremes. In the light of Stepan's infidelity and his expensive way of living, Dolly and her children suffer considerably. Dolly would like to walk out of the marriage. But her children, convention, and her religious beliefs all contribute to her indecision on the course of action. A vain belief that her husband's conduct is not \"infidelity of the heart\" keeps her going on with her \"sham\" marriage. The book consists of two separate yet interconnected plots: One is the plot woven around Anna and the other is the plot woven around Levin. Former, with its complex emotions, social conventions coupled with women's position legally and socially, provides for the excitement and life of the entire work. The latter, more or less modeled on Tolstoy's life, provides for the political, philosophical, social, and religious views of the author as well as an insight into the author's life struggles. I liked both plots. Each has complemented the other to produce a complete work in every sense. And the characters which were modeled by Tolstoy's observance of the society were felt real. There were no characters that one could call artificial. Above all what is most striking is the beautiful writing of Tolstoy. His use of metaphors is very clever and marvelous. Reading the book was like eating a rich and thick layered piece of cake. No matter how many layers are peeled, its taste does not diminish. Words would not do justice to say how much I loved this work. It is one brilliant and marvelous piece of work. A work can be a great classic, but to become a masterpiece, the author has to steer it above common ground. And Tolstoy has achieved this end quite brilliantly.

        "text":"Alright, I'm going to do my best not to put any spoilers out here, but it will be kind of tough with this book. I should probably start by saying that this book was possibly the best thing I have ever read. It was my first Tolstoy to read, and the defining thing that separated what he wrote from anything else that I've read is his characters. His characters are unbelievably complex. The edition of this book that I read was over 900 pages, so he has some time to do it. His characters aren't static, but neither are they in some kind of transition from A to B throughout the book. They are each inconsistent in strikingly real ways. They think things and then change their minds. They believe something and then lose faith in it. Their opinions of each other are always swirling. They attempt to act in ways that align with something they want, but they must revert back to who they are. But who a character is is a function of many things, some innate and some external and some whimsical and moody. So all the characters seem too complex to be characters in a book. It's as if no one could write a character that could be so contradictory and incoherent and still make them believable, so no one would try to write a character like Anna Karenina. But people are that complex, and they are incoherent and that's what makes Tolstoy's characters so real. Their understandings of each other and themselves are as incoherent as mine of those around me and myself. One of the ways that Tolstoy achieves this is through incredible detail to non-verbal communication. He is always describing the characters movements, expressions, or postures in such a way that you subtly learn their thoughts. He does an amazing job in the internal monologues the characters experience. You frequently hear a character reason with himself and reveal his thoughts or who he is to you in some way, and all the while you feel like you already knew that they felt that or were that. Even as the characters are inconsistent. There are times when he can describe actions that have major implications on the plot with blunt and simple words and it still felt rich because the characters are so full. The book takes on love, marriage, adultery, faith, selfishness, death, desire\/attraction, happiness. It also speaks interestingly on social classes or classism. He also addresses the clash between the pursuit of individual desires and social obligations\/restraints. There is just so much to wrestle with here. And you go through a myriad set of emotions and impressions of the characters as you read. At times you can love or hate or adore a character. You can be ashamed of or ashamed for or reviled by or anxious with or surprised by a character. And you feel this way about each of them at points. But it isn't at all a roller coaster ride of emotion. It's fluid and natural and makes sense. One of the many points that the book seemed to reach to me was the strength and power of love. Tolstoy displays it in all its power and all its inability. In the end love is not sufficient enough to sustain. He writes tremendous triumphs for it, and then he writes the months after when the reality of human failings set in. But love is good, and there is hope. Life can be better with love in it. Should I have kids one day I think I'll make reading this book a precondition for them to start dating (that and turning 25). I was also surprised by a section towards the end of the book where Tolstoy through Levin, my favorite character and the one that I identified with the most, makes a case for Christianity that was so simple but at the same time really impacted me. I guess I'll leave that alone here. Basically, I don't have high enough praise for this book. I hope everyone reads it. It is very long, and I found the third quarter or so slow. But I could definitely read it again. Not soon but it could become a must read every 15 years or so for me. Between he nature of the content and the quality of the words, I would say that this is the greatest masterpiece in words that I've ever found."

        "text":"Levin (which is what the title should be, since he is the main character, the real hero and the focus of the book!) (But who would read the book with that title, I know!) If you don't want to know the ending, don't read this review, though I won't actually talk about what happens to Anna specifically, something I knew 40 years ago without even reading the book. I didn't read the book to find out what happens to her. I knew that. Probably many of you know or knew the ending before reading the book. And this isn't so much a review as a personal reflection. I was tempted, finally, after decades of NOT reading it, to now, approaching my 60th birthday, finish it, all 818 pages, tempted to just simply write: Pretty good! :) But I resist that impulse, sorry (because now, if you so choose to read on, you will have to read many more than those two words. . .). This is as millions of people have observed over the past 140 years, a really great book, and those of you who are skeptical of reading \"Great Books\" or \"classics\" may still not be convinced, but this has in my opinion a deserved reputation of one of the great works of all time, and one of the reasons it IS so good is because it speaks humbly and eloquently against pomposity and perceived or received notions of \"greatness.\" Why do I care about its place in the canon? I guess I really don't. I just think some books deserve the rep they get from the literary establishment, and some deserve the rep they get from the wider reading public. This one is a great literary accomplishment AND a great read, in my opinion, and deserves to be read and read widely by more than just the English major club. And I say this as one who prefers Dostoevsky to Tolstoy; I seem to prefer stories of anguish and doubt to stories of affirmation and faith, and the atheist\/agnostic literary club I belong to is maybe always going to favor doubt and anguish over faith and hope and happiness. But to make clear: This surely is a book of faith, of family, of affirmation, of belief in the land, nature, goodness, and simple human joys over the life of \"society\" with all of its pretension. Yes, all that affirmation is true of the book in spite of what happens to Anna. I write this in particular contexts, as we all do when we read and write. If I had read this book in my more cynical early twenties, when I actually started it once (and again a few times over my life time and never finished), when I had no kids, I might not have liked it much. If I had read this right after Crime and Punishment and The Brothers Karamazov, or in the years I was first reading Under the Volcano, Kafka, Camus, what I think of as my existentialist years, I might have found it too. . . life-affirming. But today I have kids, and as seemed to have happened with Chris Ware, as evidenced by his more positive Building Stories, having kids changed everything for me, and in a good way. In harsh times, you need stories of hope and goodness, and Levin's story is a timeless story of hope and goodness. Another context: I am particularly shaken as I write this by the 20 kids dead in a Connecticut elementary school in Sandy Hook yesterday, with, too, a good teacher, principal, and school psychologist and others who have given their lives to doing good for children, senselessly slaughtered. This is a murderous country, the most murderous in the world, killings devastating my Chicago on a daily basis maybe especially this year, but every damned year. And despair\/suicide is possibly more prevalent than ever. Maybe it is time for a bit of reordering priorities toward goodness, and finishing this book as my news feeds gave me updates on the tragedy provides an interesting contrast in experiences, rendering different but altogether persuasive truths about the nature of the world. Tolstoy was himself, the translator Richard Pevear writes in his fine, brief introduction, in some sense writing a response to the nihilists who were as he saw it in fashion in late nineteenth century Russia, in Moscow, in Europe, in the world. Tolstoy was himself searching for meaning in life and struggling with faith and beliefs in a way he didn't ever struggle about again (or as much) after this book, and the struggle makes for the greatness, in my opinion. His late book Resurrection, by contrast, has none of the struggle about faith that this book has in it. It's mostly a binary world, all Good and Evil, a didactic allegory. Pevear says one of the two main characters, Levin, the country farmer struggling to also write his ideas about farming, is the most fully realized self-portrait that Tolstoy created, and he is on the main pretty delightful. Grumpy at times, stubborn, moody and not witty, a kind of no-nonsense traditionalist I certainly would have been annoyed at regularly if I knew him, Levin is often a kind of comical character, self-deprecatingly clueless as he approaches the Big Events of his life: His brother's death, his proposal to Kitty, the birth of his first child. These are also moments of real angst\/anguish and passion and comedy\/tragedy, written with great flourish and amazing detail, great sections of the book, pretty thrilling to read, in my opinion. These are, Tolstoy tells us, in the main what life (and literature) is and should be mainly about, love and death, and they deserve loving attention for us, as are also the striving for goodness and faith. The current art scene of the time, in especially Moscow's theater and art and literature scenes, the world of fashion, the culture of massive-debt-incurring spending on a lavish lifestyle, all this Tolstoy skewers through the comical eyes of the simple farmer Levin, who at his best is so attached to the land, to family, to love, to good talk, and good friendship. But he is not a stereotype, he is a great character, fully realized. And what can we say of Anna, the other main character, his sort of opposite? Well, if you want to look for what is in some sense a \"moral\" of this huge tome of a book, this might be it: “If you look for perfection, you'll never be content.” Or, if you want to be happy you will want to make choices that Levin makes instead of Anna's tragic choices--but Anna, in having been originally intended by Tolstoy (thanks to Pevear here for his introduction) as an immoral woman, a woman corrupted by city values, is never really only that, any more than Levin can be seen as a holy man. Tolstoy is creating literature here, not a didactic tract, and we see all along that Tolstoy falls in love with Anna as she emerges through his creation of her in his novel, and she is thus for him and us real and fascinating, a human being, and a wondrous one in many ways, one of the great women of literature, without question. You don't have to agree with her choices or like her, but she will come to life for you as few characters ever will. And many of you will fall in love with her as Tolstoy did. As I did, I'll admit. There's one time Tolstoy has his two main characters meet, and this is a great evening, where the simple Levin actually is obviously attracted to Anna in so many ways, and not just the physical attraction all men and women seem to have for her. Levin, like Tolstoy, sees that Anna is vital, viscerally alive, she's fascinating, interesting; okay, she IS a romantic heroine, but she is a romantic heroine that anyone reading romances should read. The women of Wuthering Heights, Jane Eyre, Anna Karenina, Madame Bovary, these are \"romances\" but they are all so much more, that sweep you into the world in richer and deeper ways. Anna Karenina is, like War and Peace, like The Brothers Karamazov, a rich cultural forum, a series of linked meditations on farming and politics and religion and family and relationships and war and the meaning of life, not just about sex and romance. You get so much out of it, as it is all about reflecting on and teaching you how the mundane aspects of our lives are worth paying attention to (I know the bulk of readers absolutely hate the farming and politics sections of the book, but I would contend it is all relevant to Tolstoy's webbed narrative reflection on the meaning of life). And Anna, in the very center of this tale, as a kind of twin contrast to Levin, but not a simple one (they are both suicidal at times; they both are moody and struggle and are essentially lonely for much of the book), is one shimmering, tragic character we can't simply dismiss for submitting to and crushing her life (as she does) through lust for Vronsky. We come to understand her well, we come to understand why she does what she does and why we must pity her and even support her, love her. I know a lot of people have not come to this position about her, they dismiss her as a shallow twit who throws her life away for an also shallow, callous dashing fellow, but in the end we even come to like Vronsky and pity him, and admire his resilience. He IS also an attractive character, in many ways, in spite of his shallow aspects. And maybe we are even sympathetic for them in this forbidden, unwise love. I know I am. We care for them. Of the other main characters, I liked Kitty, Levin's wife (who deals with the dying of her husband's brother so deftly as opposed to her clueless husband) a lot, and who becomes attracted to Vronsky too in a way as so may women seem to do. Levin's two brothers are both great, and provide the basis for rich conversations. The Dolly\/Oblonsky pair are yet another view of a married relationship. I even like the portrait of the sad, stiff Karenin, the diplomat we can see is a good man, certainly not a great lover for Anna, but we see his struggles and come to feel sorry for him, I think. He's not an ideal match for the passionate Anna, maybe, but he's a good and essentially blameless man. I like all the minor characters we get to meet, too, the people Tolstoy finds more genuine than all the upper crust he mocks and derides and, you know, also cares about. This is a great book, my friends, with some great characters and great scenes. And now to the movie? I read one blurb that said without Tolstoy's gorgeous writing, any movie version of Anna Karenina will only be a soap opera, and that is what I feared. . . and that is what I found in seeing it. The movie couldn't begin to capture Tolstoy's reflections on life and love and birth and death. It was a melodrama, a good one but not great or rich as the novel. And what do English readers miss, as my friends who read Russian and have grown up reading his prose IN Russia say? That his use of the Russian language is unparalleled, gorgeous, breathtaking. Well, I don't know the language in which Tolstoy wrote, but this translation of his tale is pretty amazing, I think. But in any language, read it, my friends. PS I have also recently read Madame Bovary, which I also liked in spite of the main character's (also) bad choices. I liked Anna K even more, though."

        "text":"\"I think... if it is true that there are as many minds as there are heads, then there are as many kinds of love as there are hearts.\" ― Leo Tolstoy, Anna Karenina As I drew back the cover and stepped into the world of the Russian aristocracy, I found myself entranced by the excess and proper etiquette. A realm of high society so foreign, so inviting, that I couldn’t turn away. My eyes devoured Tolstoy’s delicious words like the sweetest candy. The characters called me in, seating me in the front row where I would have the best view. The book became an electric moment in time as their stories bewitched me. I urged Levin not to give up on love. I watched on in disbelief as a perfectly beautiful Anna was overcome with a passion that turned her into someone she no longer knew. I was dumbfounded at how Vronsky, a man filled with selfish desire, could so easily tear apart everyone who came near him and soldier on as if it were merely another day. These three were only a tiny portion of the troupe that would dominate my mind as I became wrapped up in their fates as if they were my own.. Love and pain, two such opposite emotions, yet intricately tied to one another. These were the driving forces behind this fantastic tale. It was a study of connections and intense passions, that ran the gamut from husband and wife to the affection that a man has for his country. In the end, the weight was almost unbearable for each that leapt. No matter which kind of love, there is always a price, and they had to be willing to pay it. Very soon after I started this book, I knew the tracks would no longer be there for many of my favorite characters and that I would plunge into the abyss along with them if I didn’t get off at the next stop. I couldn’t leave them. I needed to be a part of their world even if it ended badly. As much affection as this story gave, it equally took back in tears and heartbreak. The story is brilliant, and I could never do it justice here. If you haven’t read Anna Karenina I urge you to put aside the fact that it is a very lengthy novel and take it up. I am forever changed."

        "text":"Another classic in the books! I have to say, Anna Karenina is the most spoiled book I have ever encountered. I was not surprised by the ending because I have seen dozens of books, movies, etc. where the climax of this book is discussed with reckless abandon. If this book has not been spoiled for you yet, and if your luck is anything like mine, read it soon! Russian names: Have you read any Russian authors before? If so, you know that not only are names repeated over and over, they are also often said in totality and they have several variations – some of which are nothing like each other. Because of this, if you try this one, get ready for lots of names and possible confusion over which character is being discussed. But, don’t worry! In general, the key players are easy to follow. Russian politics and labor: While this large tome has lots of story, it also has a lot of discussion on Russian politics and the labor climate at the time it was written. This could prove to be either interesting for you or boring depending on what you are looking for in a book. I did not mind it much; it did not end up being my favorite part of the book, but I do think it added a lot to the atmosphere and setting. The role of Women: Overall, I was left with the impression that during the time this was written, women were treated very unfairly in Russia (and, I am sure, all around the world). No matter what happened or who was at fault, a woman paid the price. I know this still goes on today with women being considered “sluts” if they sleep around, but men are considered “studs”. Shows that in some respects we have not advanced very much as a society! If a story based on unequal treatment based on gender interests you, this is a good one to read and analyze. Overall impression: I enjoyed this book a lot. I have seen many fawn over it as some of the greatest literature ever. I don’t feel like I was quite that enamored with it, but it was an enjoyable, easy to read, follow, and appreciate. I am very glad I took the time to read this classic and if you are looking to take on a big, famous book, this one would not be a bad choice."

        "text":"“ Anna Karenina ,” my friend told me, “is one of the few books that have influenced how I live my life from day to day.” This statement touches on a question I often wonder about: Can reading great fiction make you a better person? I don’t mean to ask whether it can improve your mental agility or your knowledge of the world, for it undoubtedly does. But can these books make you kinder, wiser, more moral, more content? The answer to this question is far from self-evident. And maybe we should be doubtful, when we consider how many disagreeable Shakespeare fans have probably existed. Nevertheless, I suspect that most of us are inclined to say yes, these books do improve us. But how? Here are my answers. First, many great works of fiction tackle the moral question directly: What does it mean to be good? How do you live a good life? What is the point of it all? Dostoyevsky is the exemplary author in this respect, who was intensely, almost morbidly, preoccupied with these questions. Second, great fiction often involves a social critique; many well-known authors have been penetrating guides into the hypocrisies, immoralities, and stupidities of their societies. Dickens, for example, is famous for spreading awareness of the plights of the poor; and Jane Austen performed a similar task in her novels, though much more quietly, by satirizing the narrow, pinched social rules the landed gentry had to abide by. Finally, we come to great literature’s ability to help us empathize. By imagining the actions, thoughts, feelings, desires, and hopes of another person—a person perhaps from a different time, with different values—we learn to see the world from multiple points of view. This not only helps us to understand others, but also helps us to understand ourselves. And this is important, since a big part of wise living (in my experience at least) involves the ability to see ourselves from a distance, as only one person among many, and to treat ourselves with the same good-natured respect as we treat our good friends. And the master of empathy is undoubtedly Leo Tolstoy. Leo Tolstoy was a contradictory man. He idolized the peasants and their simple life, and he preached a renunciation of worldly riches; and yet he maintained his aristocratic privileges till the end of his life. He considered marriage to be of enormous importance in living a moral life, and yet his relationship with his wife was bitterly unhappy and he ended up fleeing his house to escape. And as Isaiah Berlin pointed out in his essay on Tolstoy’s view of history, he yearned for unity and yet saw only multiplicity in the world. I can’t help attributing this contradictoriness to his nearly supernatural ability to sympathize with other points of view, which caused him to constantly be pulled in different directions. This is on full display in Anna Karenina , but I can’t discuss this or anything else about the book without copious spoilers. So if you are among the handful of people who don’t know the plot already, here is your warning. Like so many authors, Tolstoy here writes about a “fallen” woman who ends up in a bad situation. But unlike anyone else, Tolstoy presents this story without taking any clear moral stance on Anna, her society, her betrayed husband, or her lover. It is, for example, close to impossible to read this simply as a parable of the immoral woman getting her just desserts. What was Anna supposed to do? She would have condemned herself to a life of unhappiness had she stayed with Karenin. And it can hardly be said that she was responsible for her unhappy marriage, since marriages in those days were contracted when women were very young, for reasons of power and wealth, not love. Tolstoy makes this very clear, and as a result this book can be read, in part, as a feminist critique of a society that severely limits the freedom of women and condemns them to live at the mercy of their fathers and husbands. But this is not the whole story. If it is impossible to read this book as a parable of an immoral wife, it is equally impossible to read it as the heroic struggle of a wronged women against an immoral society. Anna is neither wholly right nor wrong in her decision. For in choosing to abandon her husband, she also chooses to abandon her son. Admittedly, it was only the social rules that forced her to make this choice, but the fact remains that she knowingly chose it. What’s more, unlike in Madame Bovary , where the deceived husband is not a sympathetic character, Tolstoy brings Karenin to life, showing us an imperfect and limited man, but a real man nonetheless, a man who was deeply hurt by Anna’s actions. A similar ambiguity can be seen in the relationship between Anna and Vronsky. Tolstoy never makes us doubt that they do truly love one another. This is not the story of vanity or lust, but of tender, affectionate love—a love that was denied Anna for her whole life before her affair. For his part, Vronsky is also neither wholly bad nor good. He wrongs Karenin without any moral scruples; but his love for Anna is so deep—at least at first—that he gives up his respectability, his position in the military, and even his good relationship with his family to be with her. I cannot admire Vronsky, but it is impossible for me to condemn him, just like it is impossible for me to condemn Anna or Karenin, for they were all making the choices that seemed best to them. The final effect of these conflicts is not a critique of society nor a parable of vice, but a portrayal of the tragedy of life, of the unhappiness that inevitably arises when desires are not in harmony with values and when personalities are not in harmony with societies. The other thread of this book—that of Levin and Kitty—is where Tolstoy tells us how to be happy. For Tolstoy, this involves a return to tradition; specifically, this means a return to rural Russian tradition and a concomitant shunning of urban European influence. Levin and Kitty’s happy life in the countryside is repeatedly contrasted with Vronsky and Anna’s unhappy life in the city. Levin is connected with the earth; he knows the peasants and he works with them, while Vronsky only associates with aristocrats. Levin is earnest, provincial, and clumsy, while Vronsky is urbane, cosmopolitan, and suave. Kitty is simple, unreflecting, and pure-hearted, while Anna is well-read, sophisticated, and passionate. The most obvious symbol of Europeanization is the fateful railway. Anna and Vronsky meet in a train station; Vronsky confesses his love to Anna in another train station; and it is of course a train that ends Anna’s life. Levin, by contrast, catches sight of Kitty as he sits in the grass in his farm, while Kitty goes by in a horse-drawn carriage. Anna and Vronsky travel to Italy to see the sights, while for Levin even Moscow is painfully confusing and shallow. This contrast of urban Europe with rural Russia is mirrored in the contrast of atheism with belief. Like Dostoyevsky, Tolstoy attributed the growing disbelief in Christianity to the nefarious influence of the freethinking West. In Tolstoy’s view—and in this respect he’s remarkably close to Dostoyevsky—Russians were mistaken to gleefully import European technologies and modes of thought without paying attention to how appropriate these new arrivals were to Russia. Both Tolstoy and Dostoevsky wanted Russia to develop its own path into the future, a path that relied on an embrace of the Christian ethic, not an attempt to fill the vacuum left by religion with socialism and science. The final scene of this novel—where Levin renounces his old free-thinking ways and embraces Christianity—is the ultimate triumph of Russia over Europe in Levin’s soul. But this is where the book rings the most hollow for me. For here Tolstoy is attempting to put up one mode of life as ideal, while his prodigious ability to see the world from so many points of view makes us doubt whether there is such a thing as an ideal life or one right way of viewing the world. At least for me, Tolstoy's magnificent empathy is the real moral lesson I have taken away from this book. His insights into the minds and personalities of different people is staggering, and I can only hope to emulate this, in my own small way, as I fight the lifelong battle with my own ego."

        "text":"Anna Karenina is a remarkable story about society, faith and love. Included is a large range of emotions with some character flaws such as infidelity, unethicalness and selfishness. All the characters are intertwined with Anna in some form. Anna and the Count, Stephen and Dolly, Kitty and Levin the last being the most honest and likeable. Anna's first sighting of Count Vronsky is a string pulling of the heart with the railway station as the backdrop of their meeting. The Count finds Anna's beauty captivating. The love affair between the Count and Anna leads her to act in a way that is not befitting her rank in society. She forgets herself and tells Karenin she loves the Count. A strict moral code leaves Anna socially ostracized by society rules, she is shamed and shunned. Her love is very sad, for her the outcome is truly tragic. Her desires and changes in her life did not really give her physical or mental happiness, mostly suffering. Anna's story is paralleled by that of strong-minded Levin and charming Kitty, frivolous Stiva and loyal Dolly. Dolly finds Steven (charming yet non conforming in his life as a parent and not being responsible to fulfill his role as a husband and father) cheating on her. In yet she has the most ordinary of values in family. She finds great joy in the moments with her children her primary motivation in life giving her great meaning. Princess Kitty and Levin are quite charming and by far my favorite. He is older, their beliefs are different and yet they complement each other quite well. Levin is rejected at first as Kitty is smitten by another and Levin retreats to his farm and has many peasant families working with him. His bouts makes him search for the meaning of life which makes him skeptical in his beliefs. He eventually finds peace with God. He has loved Kitty always. Kitty is sensitive and compassionate. They marry. Life for them is good and their love is true. The story is beautifully written, rich and complex in morals. The novel is a cautionary tale of what not to do. This is not Anna's story it is Levin's and Tolstoy who are one in their moral and spiritual beliefs. “There are as many different kinds of love as there are different hearts” Leo Tolstoy in his timeless novel.

        "text":"It amuses me to no end how there has been no perceivable ebb in the flow of Holocaust-World War II novels and yet every time a Toni Morrison and an Alice Walker and a Richard Wright and a Ralph Ellison have tried to address the elephant in the room or America's endemic race problem which like a many-headed monster continues to rampage on unvanquished, they have been accused of betraying an overt political mindedness and a violation of that much harped upon maxim of 'art for art's sake.' \"Oh Toni Morrison won the Nobel because she wrote about slavery you know!\" Before you scoff at the above declamation let me mention that I have quoted that statement verbatim. 6 million Jews, 7 years. Unaccounted for anonymous millions, 4 centuries. But alas like every other literary theme on the planet, brutalization of human beings, too, has its color-coded hierarchical positions within the canon. The sweeper is worse off than a slave, for the slave may change his master and his duties and may even become free, but the sweeper is bound forever, born into a state from which he cannot escape and where he is excluded from social intercourse and the consolations of his religion. So slavery. A word which no longer evokes the kind of knee-jerk instinctual horror or pathos that it should and has descended into the realms of banality through repeated use over the years. And yet the word refuses to become just another obsolete dictionary entry with its persistent reappearances before us in myriad new grotesque avatars. Forced prostitution, human trafficking, slavery of illegal immigrant workers, bonded labor and so on and so forth. Our own home-made brand of slavery-segregation went by the label of 'untouchability', another convenient, religion-sanctioned writ flagrantly upheld by authorities. Quote obscure mumbo jumbo from scriptures, invent excuses to justify your irrational bias and manipulate the system into giving 'religion' free reign and tada your status quo has been manufactured. He realised he couldn't rush even though the Mahatma had abolished all caste distinctions for the day. He might touch someone and then there would be a scene. The Mahatma would be too far away to come and help him. One can call this work a thinly disguised attempt at political pamphleteering because there is very little literary merit to be found here. No linguistic shenanigans to express apoplectic joy over. No dazzling imagery to wax eloquent about. A book named 'Untouchable' on an untouchable latrine-cleaner can boast of no thematic subtlety either. To add to these causes of botheration, Anand devotes a portion to the exaltation of Gandhi who had initially felt the necessity of vindicating the caste system (probably to forestall criticism of Hinduism) despite championing the cause of the harijan ('untouchable'). If you have read enough Arundhati Roy or are aware of her political views, you probably know what I am talking about. So yes this novel is a product of a time and the awakening collective consciousness of an emerging nation-state. It is unable to reconcile an essentially hostile social milieu to the aspirations of an enlightened new generation and merely musters up a robust optimism for the foreseeable future. But it added to a much needed discourse at a time when it was in short supply. So there. Of course, caste-based violence is still a regularly resurfacing news item and stigmatization of crematorium\/graveyard workers, garbage-collectors and assorted dregs of society has not been completely obliterated. But the normalization of the relentless verbal and physical abuse that Bakha, our 'untouchable' protagonist, is subjected to in the book has long been discontinued. Unable to love it whole-heartedly as I was, I am still painfully aware of this book's relevance. May we be forgiven for passive participation in the ritual dehumanization of a section of society but may we never forget."

        "text":"Soul crushing. We in the West know nothing about degradation. The strife and misery of this narrative! And yet the writing is captivating, the modulation of emotion through action and image masterful. A novel of people whose very essence, they’ve been told for thousands of years, is defilement. I must read more on caste and how it came to be. It’s incomprehensible to the Western mind. Bakha, a strong young man, a sweeper of latrines, has spent time at the British barracks, where he was treated as if he possessed no taint. This has broadened his thinking, shown him the imbecility of the millennia-old system he lived under, and made him feel things could be different than they are. Bakha and his kind are, among other indecencies, deprived of education, fed like swine, denied participation in community, and consigned to wretched quarters. As the story progresses, and Bakha is assailed from all quarters with declarations of “pollution, pollution!” That this handsome and industrious young man should on this day, perhaps for the first time, truly feel the proportions of the terrible trap that is his life, makes for a terrible moment. He was part of a consciousness which he could share and yet not understand. He had been lifted from the gutter, through the barriers of space, to partake of life which was his, and yet not his. He was in the midst of a humanity which included him in its folds and yet debarred him from entering into a sentient, living, quivering contact with it. (p. 137) The Mahatma shows up with a message tailor made for Bakha. It’s a subtle bit of didacticism in which one is reminded of certain harangues of Dostoyevsky . Fortunately it’s brief. Untouchability was prohibited by law some 65 years ago. But it is said that Indian elections still reflect a caste consciousness. How could they not, after millennia under such a system? The book, scatological in the extreme, is deeply moving, mainly due to the rage it evokes in the reader. It is also utterly without parallel in my reading experience. That is, I’ve never read anything else that even touches on the subject in the headlong manner this does. PS Guess who helped Anand with his novel? His initials are M.G. PPS If you’re going to read this you must also read B.R. Ambedkar’s Annihilation of Caste , fascinating."

He wanted to warm his flesh; he wanted the warmth to get behind the scales of the dry, powdery surface that had formed on his fingers; he wanted the blood in the blue veins that stood out on the back of his hand to melt.\" You know, in a memoir of his first story “Lost child”, Mulkraj Anand mentioned that he dared to show his story to Virginia Woolf. She asked him to read it out in her next home party. Desmond Macarthy, Victoria Sackill West, Edward Garnet, clapped after he read his story. During that time, in one of her pamphlets, Virginia Woolf attacked many novelists like Arnold Bennet, H G Wells, John Galsworthy, for writing about the characters of sub- world. This shocked Mulkraj because he was planning to write this novel about the untouchable people. He was further demotivated when one of the young poets, after knowing that Mulkraj was going to write about his growing up years among tough boys, sons of bandsmen, washer men and sweepers, said, leave your Cockneys in their sordid world….As we ignore the Russian writer Gorky’s ‘Lower depths’; write like Laurence Hope about flowers in garden Shalimar! Then coming back to India, Mulkraj wrote this novel under the guidance of Gandhi. Gandhi advised him not to use big english words and to use the local language. This is story of a sweeper named Bakha, a young and intelligent character. Through the ordeals and activities of life of Bakha, his family, his friends and other characters writer has given a wonderful but tyrannical imagery of those days when the untouchability was a great challenge in Indian society. He has depicted very artfully the conflicts between the high caste and lower caste people in the society and has finally reached to the argument that the untouchability was inhumane. Bakha is a representative of down trodden in the pre-independent era of India. He suffers because of his caste and all the lower castes people are suffering because they are by birth outcaste. Writer has depicted the hypocrisy of the upper caste people that men like Pt. Kali Nath enjoy the touch of the lower caste girls, but do not treat lower caste people equally in other matters. He has exposed all this hypocrisy and double standards. Bakha has been portrayed as a universal figure to show the oppression, injustice, humiliation to the whole community of the outcastes in India in this book. An attractively written story by Anand, proving a fact that social exclusion and exploitation of the subaltern is well rooted in the caste system of India ! An outcast was not allowed to enter into the house of higher caste, even when food was required in utmost urgency… \"For being an outcaste he could not insult the sanctity of the house by climbing on the house on the top floors where the kitchens were, but had to shout and announce his arrival from below. ‘Bread for the sweeper mother bread for the sweeper,’ He called standing in the door of the first house. His voice died down to the echo of ‘thak, thak, thak’, which stole into the alley. ‘The sweeper has come for the bread, mother!” he shouted a little louder. But it was of no avail. He penetrated further into the alley and standing near a point where the doors of four houses were near each other, He shouted his call: ‘Bread for the sweeper, mother; bread for the sweeper.’ Yet no one seemed to hear him on the tops of the house.\""

        "text":"This is only a short book and the first two-thirds are quite interesting - a day in the life of a downtrodden Untouchable latrine cleaner and his rat-eating family. The preaching of the last third rather spoiled it though. It is true that flush lavatories would solve the problem for the toilet-cleaning caste, but it is hardly a solution for the Untouchables, no matter what name Gandhi gave them. Part of the problem of the Untouchable caste is that it isn't actually a problem at all for anyone who isn't Untouchable, in fact it's desirable to have them. Since they, the pariahs of society, do all the work that no one else wants to do, and at minimum wage, and all this exploitation can be justified as being in the name of religion, in the name of not interfering with the Infinite plan there is no impetus from society to improve these people's lives. It's not so far from the way the US treats illegal Mexican immigrants. It allows them to stay to do the work that no one else wants to do for those wages in those conditions. They live in fear of everything and everyone. If they are beaten, robbed or raped they have no redress. They daren't complain. So just as with the Untouchables not being a problem if you aren't one, neither are the illegal immigrants. In the UK, it is different. An illegal immigrant can either 'disappear' as in the US or claim asylum and is immediately housed and given an allowance for years while his case is 'considered'. If he loses but by then has a child here or would face discrimination in his own country, he can claim that deportation would breach his human rights. The gvt. will then pay for a lawyer to fight for him. If he wins, he can then bring in his family. There are two ways, from a religious point of view, of looking at them. Either they must have done something pretty dreadful in their previous lives to get born an Untouchable and this is Divine punishment, or alternatively, these people must have been really good dogs, cockroaches or whathaveyou to have become human in this life and who are mere humans to interfere with this great Cycle? When looked at in this way, it's a pretty clever organising of society, of religion, to get the work done. Another way of putting it, one more familiar to us, is the richer get richer and the poor live in ghettos and clean the houses, shops, subways and streets for them. One of the solutions proposed is Christianity, which has the great advantage of not having a rebirth system so a lowly caste becomes a class problem for which education can provide a ladder up and out. Another solution, one partly in effect now, was Gandhi's renaming the caste Harijan, or Children of God, and his movement to include rather exclude them from society. The third solution isn't sadly as widespread as it ought to be, the flush toilet. The poor who live and sleep on the pavements still shit in the gutter, those living in slums and tenements crap into plastic bags which they launch far into the air earning them the nickname of parachutes and those slightly less poor than that have flush toilets but no running water. So whether its cleaning latrines or cleaning (un)flushed toilets, or sweeping the streets clean of 'parachute' bags, this caste of Untouchables, these Children of God, are still plying their traditional trade. Sometimes I wonder if everything evil under the sun couldn't find its justification in one religion or another? I don't like being lectured to, and I don't care what literary device is used to pretend that it's just the story not a didactic excursion by the author, I just don't like it. I would probably never have finished the book but my computer broke down and it took an hour to fix with all the endless waits while it checked files and rebooted. Lucky aren't I, to have a bookshop and only a slightly iffy computer to annoy me rather than having to live with broken flush toilets and crap to clean from the streets?

Why is it so poignant? Because we know, without it being explicitly told to us, that this is it, this is his life - it is going to be a life of repetitions, of insults piled on insults, of gradual deadening of the senses, of childhood worn away into an early old age, of bitterness and submission, of daily degradation. Until nothing remains other than another faceless untouchable, to be ignored and despised. Bakha tries hard to rise above his social standing, Mulk Raj Anand exhibiting his trademark humanism, by showcasing the essential dignity of even such a depraved condition. How? By showing us the mind - the human mind in almost any depravity retains its nobility, but only to an extent, it is perhaps hinted... In naive child-like enthusiasm, Bakha dares to dream, but we see how he is going to be worn down every day. We experience a very small bit of his life, and even though he doesn't know it, we can see that the many indignities and outrages he suffer are things he will soon grow immune to and learn to take as his lot. We know that is the problem. The ironical highpoint of the book is when Mahatma comes to Bakha's village. Mahatma comes to inspire, to uplift. Bakha was even able to catch a glimpse and hear his words. But nothing happens because of this climactic moment. Life continues, and this has been the case - despite much upliftment, the lot of the lower caste has not seen much change over the centuries. They still struggle on, noble in mind or not. This is a novella with the punch of a compact short story. It hits hard without even taking a swing. A note on the translation: When\"oye, saale!\" is translated as \"oye, brother-in-law!\" no sane Indian reader can avoid a barf. It grows very tiring to keep hearing everyone addressed as \"brother-in-law\" every few lines. I hope a new edition of the book will just substitute this jarring usage with \"saala\" and maybe add a footnote to explain the meaning and significance of the word."

I like this book for it made me feel the actual anger of the young main character and the different range of emotions which went high and low as he wanted me to experience while he was going through all the abuse, assualt and insults. This is the story of Bakha, who is an eighteen year old, belonging to a lower caste whose family of sweepers and latrine cleaners. Brought up by his neglectful and violent father alongwith his two other siblings, Bakha works hard from dawn facing all kinds of harrassment and abusive people belonging to other caste. He had to go through hunger, shame and pain most days. What was most striking about the story is the way how rational and realistic the young character is inspite of the events that happened to him and the situation he was in, both outside and inside his home. The story is what you would expect: how the 'untouchables' belonging to lower caste suffered and struggled during those days, facing humiliation all their lives for no fault of theirs. However, it is not an easy read for me. The writing is easy to follow but it has layers of emotions and expressions that would be subjected to different kinds of reaction from different readers. The second half became intense as compared to the first half as it turned into political speeches, talks about Gandhi's thoughts on several issues of inequality and destroying caste. It was eye-opening for me and I enjoyed it. But I wanted a better ending. Worth the read. I would say it would be a bit difficult for beginners otherwise give it a try. Warnings for SA, domestic violence and abuse."

Enlarge the picture in the book's cover so you can get a good look at him, the photo courtesy of the India Office Library and Records. A flesh and blood Untouchable with god-given superhuman powers. Here are some amazing things he is capable of: 1. He can part a throng of people with just the words: \"Posh, posh, sweeper coming!\" as he comes carrying his broom (cf. Moses with his stick, parting the Red Sea); 2. Just by his touch, whether done intentionally or accidentally, another person would become very angry and will call him a dog, a swine, a cock-eyed son of a bow-legged scorpion, an offspring of a pig, and so on; 3. With the same touch, even with his smallest finger, he can defile another person so that even if the latter is on his way to an important appointment and is running late, for example, he'll have to go back home to wash and purify himself; 4. His powers are carried over also by the inanimate objects he touches. If he's buying something from a store, for example, the vendor will first ask him to put his money on a bowl, which shall then be purified by washing it with water, before the vendor shall handle it; 5. He passes on his magical powers to his children; and 6. He can live without hope, be dead inside yet do his predestined chores. Look at him: his bare feet, his shapeless pants, the rags he wears, his cheap turban, his basket where he puts in the dung and dirt he sweeps from the street and collects from latrines. He is not bad-looking, physically, with his athletic built, his height, his finely-shaped nose, full lips--but look at his eyes. A lifeless pair, turned into stone by the misery of his fate. He is the lowest of the low-caste Untouchables of India; street-sweeper, latrine-cleaner, collector of human and animal waste. This is a novel about this superhero named Bakha (quite appropriate: \"Baka\" in Tagalog is cow, and cows are the holiest of animals in India). But this is more than just a story of a day in his life. This is a novel about a superhero written by another superhero:, Mulk Raj Anand--he who has this other super power called Compassion. He could not have seen Bakha for what he really was, and write about him with controlled fury, if he did not have this divine gift. The most extraordinary feats in human history are achieved not by the strong but by those with Compassion."

I read some other reviews saying this novel is about an interesting topic but it is not written in the right way. Well, there is nothing sexy about Indian poverty. It is the most desperate poverty in the world, full of squalor. It is insufferable. It is everywhere. No Bruce Springsteen songs to romanticize it. No Charles Bukowski novels filled with crazy individualists. Danny Boyle did his bit for the urban Indian poor. But Indian poverty goes on and on. Even the richest of Indians have felt like Bakha, every once in a while. You could be the most privileged Indian. But you might find yourself in situations Bakha finds himself in. That scene in the novel in which Bakha is sexually attracted to his own sister, while feeling offended that the upper caste men in the village are also eyeing her ..... I don't know what to say. Not many writers can be that honest and devastating. Decades later, the situations in this novel still exist all around me."

This story follows just one day in the life of Bakha, a young man in the sweeper caste. He lives with his father, his younger brother and younger sister, and cleans the latrines, while his father sweeps streets and the temple courtyard. The day we follow, begins positively enough for Bakha when, after having cleaned the latrines fo the fourth time, he is promised a second hand hockey stick from Havildar Charat Singh. From there it is all downhill. His father feigns an injury and sends Bakha to perform his own sweeping duties, and events unfold from there. I enjoyed this book while it was following Bakha's day, but I thought it lost form at the end where Gandhi makes an appearance to give a public lecture. Here it becomes a lecture to the reader, one that the main character himself only understands a small amount of. For me the end of the book didn't give closure - I won't go into detail, as there would be spoilers, but the story just sort of ran out of steam. 3 stars."

Sweeper coming through!’ This is the cry of the latrine cleaner\/road sweeper as he navigates his way through the crowded streets warning of his approach so people can avoid being touched and thereby polluted, requiring immediate and extensive cleansing and purification. For Bakha the latrine cleaner cannot touch or be touched. He is an untouchable. He lives with his widowed father Lakha, sister Sohini and younger brother Rakha. They clean the latrines and sweep the road for the local regiment. Importantly they are treated by the soldiers not as pariahs, but people employed to do unpleasant menial work. Bakha’s family is well established in the community, so they know the sahibs, sepoys and the other untouchables. Although I had something of an idea of what untouchable meant this story opened my eyes to the all-embracing nature of this Hindu brand of slavery cum segregation, full of abuse and insults and impossible to escape, at least in 1935, when the book was published. Bakha’s younger sister Sohini goes to the village well to collect water for the family, but must wait in the heat for others to draw their supply, and indeed cannot draw the water herself, but must rely on a person from a higher caste to draw the water on her behalf. It’s a long wait. Sohini is picked on by an older jealous woman, food is thrown and Sohini is rescued by a priest at the temple only to be molested. It should be noted that Bakha and his sister are beautiful people: young, strong, healthy and attractive, but this does not help them, in fact it probably makes the way they are treated worse. One of the Indians at the barracks, Havildar Charat Singh, of a higher caste, is a famous street hockey player who gives Bakha an old hockey stick, which would otherwise be out of his reach. While filled with gratitude, Bakha soon realises that people will think he stole it. A terrible tale of organised repression: the saddest aspect being the inevitability of Bakha becoming inured to his lot as he ages and his youthful buoyancy deflates."

If I weren't an Indian, I don't think I would've understood them completely. Also, the dialogues had a larger impact on me when I mentally translated them in Hindi, that is an area the writer cannot alter and I understand that.

Realizing the truth about the Harijans in that era of British Raj seems to be as the worse among whole period. The Brahmans were actually the root cause of such conditions in Indian Society. Discrimination among the humans in regard of the castes started with them only. No shudra can enter the temple, can't touch anybody. From the perspective of Dalits at that time, it seems to be very irritating and frustrating. These things were exist in some other cultures also, say, Burakumin in Japan; but still the condition here in India was worst. Caste is the biggest back-bone breaking step taken by British by instilling this system in Hindus of India. Dividing Hindus in micro-level statuses basis on their work and then further bifurcate it into more drastic societal status-quo manner. And what Gandhi did? Nothing .. just expanding more gaps in-between the existing castes. In the name of Equality he did nothing but just igniting the fire between upper and lower castes, as defined in the Indian society by British. And why not?, After-all Gandhi was customarily planned back in India from Africa after he made sure there, for British Empire, that Whites could rule over African blacks. Same way here in India he expand the gaps between people by highlighting their castes and made them believe that the people who are living along with them in society hate them only because they did some usual generations back work which eventually titled by British as lower level job of society. However, in their Christian country of Britain they even allow Janitors to attend churches but here they broke our harmonious society. Can't imagine the humility one can feel when he\/she get the leftover of some other person and how does it feel when someone give you any edible item by throwing it on the streets. Mr. Anand had really done a great job with his pen. Exposing the conditions of untouchables of that time was in itself a very brave and bold act. He reminds me of 'Raja Ravi Varma', who had gifted with his art, to the people of lower caste, the way of worshiping the GOD (idolaters). However the story drafted was an act of fiction but still its reflecting the realistic thoughts and realism in society at that time. Very well written, this work of fiction gives immense peace while reading it, even when, I myself, comes from the Upper (Unreserved General Category) caste in the present society system which started\/titled with this discriminating system far back. For me its: 4.5\/5.0"

With an afterword by E.M. Forster , this powerful work grapples with outsized issues of prejudice, religion, destiny, and offers some insight into tactics to overcome the system. The 2014 introduction provides important context for developments since the time of the novel. Gandhi is discussed in the forward, and appears in the novel. Apparently he was an influence on Anand. Most of the novel closely follows the sweeper Bakha, who cleans latrines and sweeps refuse from the streets. Bakha is uneducated — because he is not permitted to attend school (where he would pollute the other students). Bakha is confused by religion — because he is forbidden to enter a temple (because of pollution, etc.) Late in the book, in a moment of turmoil, Bakha encounters a Christian missionary who has adopted elements of native dress and attempted to learn the language: \"But the edge of his tongue was like a pair of scissors which cut the pattern of Hindustani into smithereens as a parrot snips his food into bits.\" The missionary provides an excuse to explore the power of Christianity to improve the lives of the underclass, but Bakha is left confused. Next up, Gandhi. The text in the late stages diverges from a clean focus on Baker's life into a muddy exploration of philosophy, and that somewhat detracts from the literary merit of the novel. What else to do, though? How else to impose this important discussion on the reader?"

        "text":"It is comfortably easy to argue against the practice of untouchability when one isn't at the receiving end. Mulk Raj Anand erases that gulf and puts the reader right into the uncomfortable and worn down ammunition shoes of Bakha, an eighteen year old manual scavenger. The book is relatively short, accounting for only a day in Bakha's life. And Anand ensures that a single day is enough. The arguments against the practice normally revolve around the socio-economic (and sometimes, political) aspect of the oppression. But 'Untouchable' takes a step closer to the individual from the collective and highlights the psychological scars that are inherited by every new generation of the outcastes's community. Bakha isn't your typical fierce, fearless and determined protagonist in spite of the fact that he has the potential to be one. There are multiple instances where his instinctual repulsion to the social setup around him, that includes him in its fold only to trample upon him and others like him, becomes obvious and painfully thwarted by a faulty reasoning that convinces him of his 'destined' place in the society. With everyone around him refusing to let him have a shred of dignity and self-respect (except of course, his sister and friends), he has little to go on and till the point he hears Gandhi's words, he appears to be spiraling downwards from a high point of apathetic acceptance in the beginning to an anguished defeat at the hands of his 'fate' of being a latrine cleaner all his life, surviving on food picked up from the streets and the sahibs' leftovers, forcefully excluded from any chances to play hockey (something he is exceptionally good at), to be educated (at the hands of two little upper caste boys) or any stray chance to raise his head high without an inexplicable shame and hesitation weighing him down. The misery of Bakha hits all the more strongly when the reader follows his thought process in which he constantly questions his so-called 'fate' and end up with unjustifiable yet, valid realizations of his social standing. He is a perfect example of a wasted potential which never fails to mark its presence and yet, never evolves. I don't know if any other book reveals the hypocrisy of an orthodox Hindu society better than Anand's 'Untouchable' but nonetheless, the book is a great read. Anand's writing style is easy and poetic with beautiful vivid description of both pictures as well as emotions."

It still exists to a certain extent in parts of India, or at least spoken about, as I have heard mention of it conversation with others in my family. Gandhiji is attributed to saying in this book - ‘the fault does not lie in the Hindu religion, but in those who profess it’. I couldn’t agree any more.

I went into this extremely uneducated, largely due to the British education system’s whitewashed and selective history topics but also my ignorance, so if like me, you are not aware of what the caste system is, it is a system as debilitating as an apartheid. This led to untouchability. This novel is short but impactful. I am not sure of the intentions beyond raising an issue that very few, if any, individuals were largely discussing at a distressing and controversial time but it does the job indeed. However, perhaps due to ignorance again, it is quite difficult to follow if you do not have an understanding of or even experience of India and its culture. I think for any reader who is perhaps not as educated as they could be, this will be a very middling read. It is incredibly interesting and emotive but the lack of description and narration that offers deeper insight meant that I could not love it as much as I would have liked due to this - which was a huge shame."

From the point of view of a sweeper, contact with Brahmins and other higher cast Hindus is fraught with peril, as accidentally touching a Brahmin can cause a riot, and in this book almost does at two points, once involving the hero, Bakha, and once involving his sister. Untouchable was written in English and published in 1935, while India was still a British Crown Colony. Bakha is drawn to the English and likes to imitate them, admiring their openness in dealing with a mere sweeper. This book is an eye-opener to one who, like me, has never been to India. The whole concept of people in lower castes contact with whom can pollute you and require prayers and ablutions leading to purification ... such a concept is so alien to me. If the condition of these Dalits, as they are also called, is still the same more than 80 years after this book, then India has a difficult task ahead adjusting to more egalitarian cultures. This is a superb book and deserves to be read, both as a work of literature and an impassioned plea for lightening the load of millions of Hindus in the lower castes."

Not only you can't touch the person, but you also can't touch things they have touched And this is a source of humiliation for those that can't be touched. In the second, half the population of the world is raised with the idea that the mere sight of their body is an offense to decency. I could go on - and talk about other such worlds - one where guns are left out in open and books are kept in shelves under locks but these whole social issues talk presented as dystopia talk has started boring me already. My point is untouchability is one of those things that should seem too fantastic if it was something imagined and not real - a bit like slavery that way. Mulk Raj Anand's novella was powerful even for me though, being an Indian, I knew its evils. It shocks me that it is not read more by western readers to whom some scenes would seem really dystopian. The first 70 percent of the novella is quite powerful - even trying to capture its protagonist's stream of consciousness at times. Later, it does turn contemplative though (I have no problem with that but it can be a turn-off for many readers); it seems to conclude that the solutions like conversion to Christianity, Gandhi, or having western toilets can solve the problem. Unfortunately, that's far from the case. A few weeks back, some upper-caste children at government schools refused to eat food prepared by lower-caste workers. Untouchability had nothing to do with the kind of work people did; it is born of the privileged too willing to think lowly of others in order to think better of themselves."

It has a message that gets presented through a sensitive and nuanced portrayal of Bakha as a complex human being with limits and aspirations. He clearly strives to attain a life beyond his station, adopting Western dress from the second-hand and discarded motley of British military clothing that he wears and even his style of sleeping. Still, the attitudes and behaviors of his position are woven into his everyday thoughts and actions. The humiliation and physical abuse that come when forgetting his place or seeking to take liberties beyond it are always imminent, there to remind him. Several such episodes of this are dramatized in the plot of the book, set in a single day: Bakha absent-mindedly brushes against a man who makes a spectacle of berating him and later causes a commotion when he approaches too close to a Hindu temple to observe the liturgy taking place. Mulk Raj Anand depicts him experiencing a wide range of emotions - exalted upon receiving a used field hockey stick, resentful at the favoritism his father shows his younger brother, curious but confused in an encounter with a Salvation Army colonel - in an unsentimental way that reinforces how much Bakha is like anyone else, if not for the plight that keeps him from being as full a person as he might be. The end of the novel features an interesting succession of figures - including an appearance by Gandhi himself - who offer reflections about the problem of untouchability and the future of India, slipping politics in explicitly but not obtrusively. I hadn't known anything about this author before but now am inclined to check out his novel \"Private Life of an Indian Prince\" and the autobiographical novels mentioned in the author bio."

The \"Lalla\" proceeds to vilify Bakha: \"Do you know you have touched me and defiled me, you cock-eyed son of a bow-legged scorpion! Now I will have to go and take a bath to purify myself. And it was a new dhoti and shirt I put on this morning!\" And Bakha's day does not improve. He is thrown off the steps of the temple where wandered to listen to the prayers and try to see into the temple although he knew his presence would \"pollute\" the temple and it would then have to undergo a purification ceremony. He must then go to a row of houses to beg for bread for his family. When finally some is thrown to him, it falls to the ground where he picks it up to bring it home to his father, sister and brother. Bakha actually displays a love of life that is momentarily depressed by these events, but which rises to the fore over and over. At the end of the day, Bakha is mystified by a Christian missionary who tries to \"save\" him from his untouchability through Jesus, an unexpected opportunity to hear (but not understand) the great Mahatma Gandhi expound his ideas for changing Indian society, and a local dandy explaining the ultimate solution to the problem of the untouchables--flush toilets. Bakha ruminates on the meaning of it all. Hopeful again, he turns for home to tell his father about Gandhi and the new machine--the flush toilets. \"Untouchable\" was a contemporary story. It is still a stirring account of the basic humanity of those members of the lowest castes of Indian society, and the wretchedness of their lives."

        "text":"Excellent book! The book is an account of a boy named Bakha, son of lakha, being a sweeper he was not allowed to be entered into the temples and other Hindu religious places as well as the homes of upper caste Hindus. Bakha liked to play hokey and dress like Sahibs and white people of the England, in suit and pants, but he wasn’t allowed to do such things. His father abused him a lot and the family of four people used to fed over the left-overs of the weddings or the breads lying near the filthy sewers. Their life was utterly miserable!! The book is based upon the idea of untouchability and emphasises on the abolition of it. There are many such instances in the novel where you’ll get disillusioned about the Indian society during the English era."

And I mean Mulk Raj Anand isn't a terrible writer, he's just very much of a time and a place, and very much in debt to 19th Century English and Russian fiction, what with the journey of the individual as he learns the world within a day, complete with a long dialogue at the end between various intellectuals that kinda smacks you over the head with its message. If you have a strong interest in India, it's probably worth your time, but I'm a bit hesitant to recommend it across the board."

        "text":"Many years ago I came across the author's name on a Thai paperback entitled จัณฑาล [presumably transliterated from Chandal (p. 92)] on some occasions in those Bangkok Book Fairs but I hadn't read and rarely heard of him. Later I have eventually known him as an eminent Indian fiction writer in English, a contemporary of R. K. Narayan, Ahmad Ali (Pakistani) and Raja Rao ( https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Mulk_Ra... ) whose pioneering English novels based on Indian rural life and plight started to gain international readership around 1930s-1960s. As for me, I have long known and read only R. K. Narayan due to probably his literary popularity and availability of his new reprints or second-hand books in Thailand. Coming to think of giving the others more credit and attention, I think I would read him more as well as Ahmad Ali and Raja Rao whenever I can find their interesting works. I found reading this fiction illuminatingly entertaining and objectively narrated since it has explored the life of an 18-year-old Indian outcaste named Bakha, an Untouchable in the Indian caste system, who works as a sweeper and latrine-cleaner. We can see that such menial toil is bitterly despised due to its filthiness, disgrace and dishonor, in other words, people tend to look down upon them as those in the low society or the lower class; they thinking they are in the high society or in the upper class. However, the author has amazingly revealed his literary expertise by means of his narratives tinged with his sense of humor in which we can enjoy reading with some tongue-in-cheek words in the extracts that follow: He shivered as he turned on his side. But he didn't mind the cold very much, suffering it willingly because he could sacrifice a good many comforts for the sake of what he called 'fashun', by which he understood the art of wearing trousers, breeches, coat, puttees, boots, etc. as worn by the British and Indian soldiers in India. (p. 12) Almost a model 'gentreman', Bakha thought him, the kind of person he admired and wanted to imitate. (p. 39) And he had felt a burning desire, while he was in the British barracks, to speak the tish-mish, tish-mish which the Tommies spoke. (p. 44) Moreover, his text also include an unexpected usage of word like 'attack' denoting Bakha's action in the context, rather than an attempt to cause damage to enemy ( https:\/\/en.wiktionary.org\/wiki\/attack... such a usage surprisingly being rarely found in other novels, especially the third excerpt in which I couldn't help wondering at first reading how he 'attacked' the package in question or if it's Dr. Anand's satire-like sense of humor, for instance: He hardly realized that he had lapsed into activity, so vigorously did he attack his job. (p. 23) He was a bit scared by the sudden unwinding of the wheel. Then he pulled himself together and renewed his attack. (p. 32) His mouth was watering. He unfolded the paper in which the jalebis were wrapped and put a piece hastily in his mouth. The taste of the warm and sweet syrup was satisfying and delightful. He attacked the package again. (p. 52) In conclusion, this novel is arguably worth reading due to its exceptional writing style, seemingly realistic plot as well as amazingly appropriate word choices in which you can enjoy and enrich your lexicons while reading on and on. Decidedly, I would find his other books and look forward to reading them more."

        "text":"Untouchable by Mulk Raj Anand, story about Indian caste system and Untouchability. Story about plight of the lower caste, how people drowned themselves in ignorance on the basis of castes and how Untouchability has been onus on Hinduism. An account of one day in Bakha's life who belongs to the lowest caste, was a street sweeper and latrine cleaner. Story about him and his gloomy circumstances which were engulfing his aspirations of being a 'Sahib' slowly. The story ends which a inspiring note where Bakha listened to Mahatma Gandhi about emancipation of the untouchables. Story is set up in pre independence era where India was infected by caste system, though it still prevails in some parts. Authors writing is very strong and has captured perfectly the plight of lower caste people. I somehow felt that it was more like an awareness story about the caste system which we all have learnt during our school time. It's sad, depressing and few scenes are quite sickening but I assume that they must be real somewhere. Its a masterpiece in terms of showing the real picture about how the lower castes which treated. Language is easy and understandable. I felt pity and sympathetic towards Bakha many times while reading. I bow down to Dr. B.R. Ambedkar who uplifted the lower caste. I will completely recommend this book because though the Bakha character is fictitious but still he is present somewhere in India."

Unaccounted for anonymous millions, 4 centuries. But alas like every other literary theme on the planet, brutalization of human beings, too, has its color-coded hierarchical positions within the canon. The sweeper is worse off than a slave, for the slave may change his master and his duties and may even become free, but the sweeper is bound forever, born into a state from which he cannot escape and where he is excluded from social intercourse and the consolations of his religion. So slavery. A word which no longer evokes the kind of knee-jerk instinctual horror or pathos that it should and has descended into the realms of banality through repeated use over the years. And yet the word refuses to become just another obsolete dictionary entry with its persistent reappearances before us in myriad new grotesque avatars. Forced prostitution, human trafficking, slavery of illegal immigrant workers, bonded labor and so on and so forth. Our own home-made brand of slavery-segregation went by the label of 'untouchability', another convenient, religion-sanctioned writ flagrantly upheld by authorities. Quote obscure mumbo jumbo from scriptures, invent excuses to justify your irrational bias and manipulate the system into giving 'religion' free reign and tada your status quo has been manufactured. He realised he couldn't rush even though the Mahatma had abolished all caste distinctions for the day. He might touch someone and then there would be a scene. The Mahatma would be too far away to come and help him. One can call this work a thinly disguised attempt at political pamphleteering because there is very little literary merit to be found here. No linguistic shenanigans to express apoplectic joy over. No dazzling imagery to wax eloquent about. A book named 'Untouchable' on an untouchable latrine-cleaner can boast of no thematic subtlety either. To add to these causes of botheration, Anand devotes a portion to the exaltation of Gandhi who had initially felt the necessity of vindicating the caste system (probably to forestall criticism of Hinduism) despite championing the cause of the harijan ('untouchable'). If you have read enough Arundhati Roy or are aware of her political views, you probably know what I am talking about. So yes this novel is a product of a time and the awakening collective consciousness of an emerging nation-state. It is unable to reconcile an essentially hostile social milieu to the aspirations of an enlightened new generation and merely musters up a robust optimism for the foreseeable future. But it added to a much needed discourse at a time when it was in short supply. So there. Of course, caste-based violence is still a regularly resurfacing news item and stigmatization of crematorium\/graveyard workers, garbage-collectors and assorted dregs of society has not been completely obliterated. But the normalization of the relentless verbal and physical abuse that Bakha, our 'untouchable' protagonist, is subjected to in the book has long been discontinued. Unable to love it whole-heartedly as I was, I am still painfully aware of this book's relevance. May we be forgiven for passive participation in the ritual dehumanization of a section of society but may we never forget."

        "text":"Soul crushing. We in the West know nothing about degradation. The strife and misery of this narrative! And yet the writing is captivating, the modulation of emotion through action and image masterful. A novel of people whose very essence, they’ve been told for thousands of years, is defilement. I must read more on caste and how it came to be. It’s incomprehensible to the Western mind. Bakha, a strong young man, a sweeper of latrines, has spent time at the British barracks, where he was treated as if he possessed no taint. This has broadened his thinking, shown him the imbecility of the millennia-old system he lived under, and made him feel things could be different than they are. Bakha and his kind are, among other indecencies, deprived of education, fed like swine, denied participation in community, and consigned to wretched quarters. As the story progresses, and Bakha is assailed from all quarters with declarations of “pollution, pollution!” That this handsome and industrious young man should on this day, perhaps for the first time, truly feel the proportions of the terrible trap that is his life, makes for a terrible moment. He was part of a consciousness which he could share and yet not understand. He had been lifted from the gutter, through the barriers of space, to partake of life which was his, and yet not his. He was in the midst of a humanity which included him in its folds and yet debarred him from entering into a sentient, living, quivering contact with it. (p. 137) The Mahatma shows up with a message tailor made for Bakha. It’s a subtle bit of didacticism in which one is reminded of certain harangues of Dostoyevsky . Fortunately it’s brief. Untouchability was prohibited by law some 65 years ago. But it is said that Indian elections still reflect a caste consciousness. How could they not, after millennia under such a system? The book, scatological in the extreme, is deeply moving, mainly due to the rage it evokes in the reader. It is also utterly without parallel in my reading experience. That is, I’ve never read anything else that even touches on the subject in the headlong manner this does. PS Guess who helped Anand with his novel? His initials are M.G. PPS If you’re going to read this you must also read B.R. Ambedkar’s Annihilation of Caste , fascinating."

He wanted to warm his flesh; he wanted the warmth to get behind the scales of the dry, powdery surface that had formed on his fingers; he wanted the blood in the blue veins that stood out on the back of his hand to melt.\" You know, in a memoir of his first story “Lost child”, Mulkraj Anand mentioned that he dared to show his story to Virginia Woolf. She asked him to read it out in her next home party. Desmond Macarthy, Victoria Sackill West, Edward Garnet, clapped after he read his story. During that time, in one of her pamphlets, Virginia Woolf attacked many novelists like Arnold Bennet, H G Wells, John Galsworthy, for writing about the characters of sub- world. This shocked Mulkraj because he was planning to write this novel about the untouchable people. He was further demotivated when one of the young poets, after knowing that Mulkraj was going to write about his growing up years among tough boys, sons of bandsmen, washer men and sweepers, said, leave your Cockneys in their sordid world….As we ignore the Russian writer Gorky’s ‘Lower depths’; write like Laurence Hope about flowers in garden Shalimar! Then coming back to India, Mulkraj wrote this novel under the guidance of Gandhi. Gandhi advised him not to use big english words and to use the local language. This is story of a sweeper named Bakha, a young and intelligent character. Through the ordeals and activities of life of Bakha, his family, his friends and other characters writer has given a wonderful but tyrannical imagery of those days when the untouchability was a great challenge in Indian society. He has depicted very artfully the conflicts between the high caste and lower caste people in the society and has finally reached to the argument that the untouchability was inhumane. Bakha is a representative of down trodden in the pre-independent era of India. He suffers because of his caste and all the lower castes people are suffering because they are by birth outcaste. Writer has depicted the hypocrisy of the upper caste people that men like Pt. Kali Nath enjoy the touch of the lower caste girls, but do not treat lower caste people equally in other matters. He has exposed all this hypocrisy and double standards. Bakha has been portrayed as a universal figure to show the oppression, injustice, humiliation to the whole community of the outcastes in India in this book. An attractively written story by Anand, proving a fact that social exclusion and exploitation of the subaltern is well rooted in the caste system of India ! An outcast was not allowed to enter into the house of higher caste, even when food was required in utmost urgency… \"For being an outcaste he could not insult the sanctity of the house by climbing on the house on the top floors where the kitchens were, but had to shout and announce his arrival from below. ‘Bread for the sweeper mother bread for the sweeper,’ He called standing in the door of the first house. His voice died down to the echo of ‘thak, thak, thak’, which stole into the alley. ‘The sweeper has come for the bread, mother!” he shouted a little louder. But it was of no avail. He penetrated further into the alley and standing near a point where the doors of four houses were near each other, He shouted his call: ‘Bread for the sweeper, mother; bread for the sweeper.’ Yet no one seemed to hear him on the tops of the house.\""

        "text":"This is only a short book and the first two-thirds are quite interesting - a day in the life of a downtrodden Untouchable latrine cleaner and his rat-eating family. The preaching of the last third rather spoiled it though. It is true that flush lavatories would solve the problem for the toilet-cleaning caste, but it is hardly a solution for the Untouchables, no matter what name Gandhi gave them. Part of the problem of the Untouchable caste is that it isn't actually a problem at all for anyone who isn't Untouchable, in fact it's desirable to have them. Since they, the pariahs of society, do all the work that no one else wants to do, and at minimum wage, and all this exploitation can be justified as being in the name of religion, in the name of not interfering with the Infinite plan there is no impetus from society to improve these people's lives. It's not so far from the way the US treats illegal Mexican immigrants. It allows them to stay to do the work that no one else wants to do for those wages in those conditions. They live in fear of everything and everyone. If they are beaten, robbed or raped they have no redress. They daren't complain. So just as with the Untouchables not being a problem if you aren't one, neither are the illegal immigrants. In the UK, it is different. An illegal immigrant can either 'disappear' as in the US or claim asylum and is immediately housed and given an allowance for years while his case is 'considered'. If he loses but by then has a child here or would face discrimination in his own country, he can claim that deportation would breach his human rights. The gvt. will then pay for a lawyer to fight for him. If he wins, he can then bring in his family. There are two ways, from a religious point of view, of looking at them. Either they must have done something pretty dreadful in their previous lives to get born an Untouchable and this is Divine punishment, or alternatively, these people must have been really good dogs, cockroaches or whathaveyou to have become human in this life and who are mere humans to interfere with this great Cycle? When looked at in this way, it's a pretty clever organising of society, of religion, to get the work done. Another way of putting it, one more familiar to us, is the richer get richer and the poor live in ghettos and clean the houses, shops, subways and streets for them. One of the solutions proposed is Christianity, which has the great advantage of not having a rebirth system so a lowly caste becomes a class problem for which education can provide a ladder up and out. Another solution, one partly in effect now, was Gandhi's renaming the caste Harijan, or Children of God, and his movement to include rather exclude them from society. The third solution isn't sadly as widespread as it ought to be, the flush toilet. The poor who live and sleep on the pavements still shit in the gutter, those living in slums and tenements crap into plastic bags which they launch far into the air earning them the nickname of parachutes and those slightly less poor than that have flush toilets but no running water. So whether its cleaning latrines or cleaning (un)flushed toilets, or sweeping the streets clean of 'parachute' bags, this caste of Untouchables, these Children of God, are still plying their traditional trade. Sometimes I wonder if everything evil under the sun couldn't find its justification in one religion or another? I don't like being lectured to, and I don't care what literary device is used to pretend that it's just the story not a didactic excursion by the author, I just don't like it. I would probably never have finished the book but my computer broke down and it took an hour to fix with all the endless waits while it checked files and rebooted. Lucky aren't I, to have a bookshop and only a slightly iffy computer to annoy me rather than having to live with broken flush toilets and crap to clean from the streets?

        "text":"A single event in the life of an untouchable toilet-cleaner, pressed into child labour due to illness in the family. It is stretched into a book, with every detail etched out. Why is it so poignant? Because we know, without it being explicitly told to us, that this is it, this is his life - it is going to be a life of repetitions, of insults piled on insults, of gradual deadening of the senses, of childhood worn away into an early old age, of bitterness and submission, of daily degradation. Until nothing remains other than another faceless untouchable, to be ignored and despised. Bakha tries hard to rise above his social standing, Mulk Raj Anand exhibiting his trademark humanism, by showcasing the essential dignity of even such a depraved condition. How? By showing us the mind - the human mind in almost any depravity retains its nobility, but only to an extent, it is perhaps hinted... In naive child-like enthusiasm, Bakha dares to dream, but we see how he is going to be worn down every day. We experience a very small bit of his life, and even though he doesn't know it, we can see that the many indignities and outrages he suffer are things he will soon grow immune to and learn to take as his lot. We know that is the problem. The ironical highpoint of the book is when Mahatma comes to Bakha's village. Mahatma comes to inspire, to uplift. Bakha was even able to catch a glimpse and hear his words. But nothing happens because of this climactic moment. Life continues, and this has been the case - despite much upliftment, the lot of the lower caste has not seen much change over the centuries. They still struggle on, noble in mind or not. This is a novella with the punch of a compact short story. It hits hard without even taking a swing. A note on the translation: When\"oye, saale!\" is translated as \"oye, brother-in-law!\" no sane Indian reader can avoid a barf. It grows very tiring to keep hearing everyone addressed as \"brother-in-law\" every few lines. I hope a new edition of the book will just substitute this jarring usage with \"saala\" and maybe add a footnote to explain the meaning and significance of the word."

This is the story of Bakha, who is an eighteen year old, belonging to a lower caste whose family of sweepers and latrine cleaners. Brought up by his neglectful and violent father alongwith his two other siblings, Bakha works hard from dawn facing all kinds of harrassment and abusive people belonging to other caste. He had to go through hunger, shame and pain most days. What was most striking about the story is the way how rational and realistic the young character is inspite of the events that happened to him and the situation he was in, both outside and inside his home. The story is what you would expect: how the 'untouchables' belonging to lower caste suffered and struggled during those days, facing humiliation all their lives for no fault of theirs. However, it is not an easy read for me. The writing is easy to follow but it has layers of emotions and expressions that would be subjected to different kinds of reaction from different readers. The second half became intense as compared to the first half as it turned into political speeches, talks about Gandhi's thoughts on several issues of inequality and destroying caste. It was eye-opening for me and I enjoyed it. But I wanted a better ending. Worth the read. I would say it would be a bit difficult for beginners otherwise give it a try.

Enlarge the picture in the book's cover so you can get a good look at him, the photo courtesy of the India Office Library and Records. A flesh and blood Untouchable with god-given superhuman powers. Here are some amazing things he is capable of: 1. He can part a throng of people with just the words: \"Posh, posh, sweeper coming!\" as he comes carrying his broom (cf. Moses with his stick, parting the Red Sea); 2. Just by his touch, whether done intentionally or accidentally, another person would become very angry and will call him a dog, a swine, a cock-eyed son of a bow-legged scorpion, an offspring of a pig, and so on; 3. With the same touch, even with his smallest finger, he can defile another person so that even if the latter is on his way to an important appointment and is running late, for example, he'll have to go back home to wash and purify himself; 4. His powers are carried over also by the inanimate objects he touches. If he's buying something from a store, for example, the vendor will first ask him to put his money on a bowl, which shall then be purified by washing it with water, before the vendor shall handle it; 5. He passes on his magical powers to his children; and 6. He can live without hope, be dead inside yet do his predestined chores. Look at him: his bare feet, his shapeless pants, the rags he wears, his cheap turban, his basket where he puts in the dung and dirt he sweeps from the street and collects from latrines. He is not bad-looking, physically, with his athletic built, his height, his finely-shaped nose, full lips--but look at his eyes. A lifeless pair, turned into stone by the misery of his fate. He is the lowest of the low-caste Untouchables of India; street-sweeper, latrine-cleaner, collector of human and animal waste. This is a novel about this superhero named Bakha (quite appropriate: \"Baka\" in Tagalog is cow, and cows are the holiest of animals in India). But this is more than just a story of a day in his life. This is a novel about a superhero written by another superhero:, Mulk Raj Anand--he who has this other super power called Compassion. He could not have seen Bakha for what he really was, and write about him with controlled fury, if he did not have this divine gift. The most extraordinary feats in human history are achieved not by the strong but by those with Compassion."

It is the most desperate poverty in the world, full of squalor. It is insufferable. It is everywhere. No Bruce Springsteen songs to romanticize it. No Charles Bukowski novels filled with crazy individualists. Danny Boyle did his bit for the urban Indian poor. But Indian poverty goes on and on. Even the richest of Indians have felt like Bakha, every once in a while. You could be the most privileged Indian. But you might find yourself in situations Bakha finds himself in. That scene in the novel in which Bakha is sexually attracted to his own sister, while feeling offended that the upper caste men in the village are also eyeing her ..... I don't know what to say.

This story follows just one day in the life of Bakha, a young man in the sweeper caste. He lives with his father, his younger brother and younger sister, and cleans the latrines, while his father sweeps streets and the temple courtyard. The day we follow, begins positively enough for Bakha when, after having cleaned the latrines fo the fourth time, he is promised a second hand hockey stick from Havildar Charat Singh.

For me the end of the book didn't give closure - I won't go into detail, as there would be spoilers, but the story just sort of ran out of steam. 3 stars."

        "text":"‘Posh! Posh! Sweeper coming through!’ ‘Posh! Posh! Sweeper coming through!’ This is the cry of the latrine cleaner\/road sweeper as he navigates his way through the crowded streets warning of his approach so people can avoid being touched and thereby polluted, requiring immediate and extensive cleansing and purification. For Bakha the latrine cleaner cannot touch or be touched. He is an untouchable. He lives with his widowed father Lakha, sister Sohini and younger brother Rakha. They clean the latrines and sweep the road for the local regiment. Importantly they are treated by the soldiers not as pariahs, but people employed to do unpleasant menial work. Bakha’s family is well established in the community, so they know the sahibs, sepoys and the other untouchables. Although I had something of an idea of what untouchable meant this story opened my eyes to the all-embracing nature of this Hindu brand of slavery cum segregation, full of abuse and insults and impossible to escape, at least in 1935, when the book was published. Bakha’s younger sister Sohini goes to the village well to collect water for the family, but must wait in the heat for others to draw their supply, and indeed cannot draw the water herself, but must rely on a person from a higher caste to draw the water on her behalf. It’s a long wait. Sohini is picked on by an older jealous woman, food is thrown and Sohini is rescued by a priest at the temple only to be molested. It should be noted that Bakha and his sister are beautiful people: young, strong, healthy and attractive, but this does not help them, in fact it probably makes the way they are treated worse. One of the Indians at the barracks, Havildar Charat Singh, of a higher caste, is a famous street hockey player who gives Bakha an old hockey stick, which would otherwise be out of his reach. While filled with gratitude, Bakha soon realises that people will think he stole it. A terrible tale of organised repression: the saddest aspect being the inevitability of Bakha becoming inured to his lot as he ages and his youthful buoyancy deflates."

It's about my country and one of the gravest problems it has faced (and continues to), the atrocious caste system and from which arose the worst possible outcome - untouchability. I did feel pitiful and sympathetic towards the character but I did not like the book which is mostly because I didn't like the narration so much. The writing, at best, is average and the story just tumbles down somewhere in the last 20 pages. This book does its job of rousing emotions and making the reader aware of the problems but that's about it. The Indian setting and culture is described but not well enough. If I weren't an Indian, I don't think I would've understood them completely. Also, the dialogues had a larger impact on me when I mentally translated them in Hindi, that is an area the writer cannot alter and I understand that. I was highly recommended this book and I'm a little let down, this book I think has a such a huge influence because it was written at a controversial and important time. Rather than concentrating on the aspects I didn't like I would instead like to give kudos to the author for raising an issue nobody was during that era."

Realizing the truth about the Harijans in that era of British Raj seems to be as the worse among whole period. The Brahmans were actually the root cause of such conditions in Indian Society. Discrimination among the humans in regard of the castes started with them only. No shudra can enter the temple, can't touch anybody. From the perspective of Dalits at that time, it seems to be very irritating and frustrating. These things were exist in some other cultures also, say, Burakumin in Japan; but still the condition here in India was worst. Caste is the biggest back-bone breaking step taken by British by instilling this system in Hindus of India. Dividing Hindus in micro-level statuses basis on their work and then further bifurcate it into more drastic societal status-quo manner. And what Gandhi did? Nothing .. just expanding more gaps in-between the existing castes. In the name of Equality he did nothing but just igniting the fire between upper and lower castes, as defined in the Indian society by British. And why not?, After-all Gandhi was customarily planned back in India from Africa after he made sure there, for British Empire, that Whites could rule over African blacks. Same way here in India he expand the gaps between people by highlighting their castes and made them believe that the people who are living along with them in society hate them only because they did some usual generations back work which eventually titled by British as lower level job of society. However, in their Christian country of Britain they even allow Janitors to attend churches but here they broke our harmonious society. Can't imagine the humility one can feel when he\/she get the leftover of some other person and how does it feel when someone give you any edible item by throwing it on the streets. Mr. Anand had really done a great job with his pen. Exposing the conditions of untouchables of that time was in itself a very brave and bold act. He reminds me of 'Raja Ravi Varma', who had gifted with his art, to the people of lower caste, the way of worshiping the GOD (idolaters). However the story drafted was an act of fiction but still its reflecting the realistic thoughts and realism in society at that time. Very well written, this work of fiction gives immense peace while reading it, even when, I myself, comes from the Upper (Unreserved General Category) caste in the present society system which started\/titled with this discriminating system far back. For me its: 4.5\/5.0"

        "text":"Written in the 1930s, this short novel follows one day in the life of a teenage \"sweeper\" who, by accident of birth, inherits the family occupation and the designation as an \"untouchable\". With an afterword by E.M. Forster , this powerful work grapples with outsized issues of prejudice, religion, destiny, and offers some insight into tactics to overcome the system. The 2014 introduction provides important context for developments since the time of the novel. Gandhi is discussed in the forward, and appears in the novel. Apparently he was an influence on Anand. Most of the novel closely follows the sweeper Bakha, who cleans latrines and sweeps refuse from the streets. Bakha is uneducated — because he is not permitted to attend school (where he would pollute the other students). Bakha is confused by religion — because he is forbidden to enter a temple (because of pollution, etc.) Late in the book, in a moment of turmoil, Bakha encounters a Christian missionary who has adopted elements of native dress and attempted to learn the language: \"But the edge of his tongue was like a pair of scissors which cut the pattern of Hindustani into smithereens as a parrot snips his food into bits.\" The missionary provides an excuse to explore the power of Christianity to improve the lives of the underclass, but Bakha is left confused. Next up, Gandhi. The text in the late stages diverges from a clean focus on Baker's life into a muddy exploration of philosophy, and that somewhat detracts from the literary merit of the novel. What else to do, though? How else to impose this important discussion on the reader?"

        "text":"It is comfortably easy to argue against the practice of untouchability when one isn't at the receiving end. Mulk Raj Anand erases that gulf and puts the reader right into the uncomfortable and worn down ammunition shoes of Bakha, an eighteen year old manual scavenger. The book is relatively short, accounting for only a day in Bakha's life. And Anand ensures that a single day is enough. The arguments against the practice normally revolve around the socio-economic (and sometimes, political) aspect of the oppression. But 'Untouchable' takes a step closer to the individual from the collective and highlights the psychological scars that are inherited by every new generation of the outcastes's community. Bakha isn't your typical fierce, fearless and determined protagonist in spite of the fact that he has the potential to be one. There are multiple instances where his instinctual repulsion to the social setup around him, that includes him in its fold only to trample upon him and others like him, becomes obvious and painfully thwarted by a faulty reasoning that convinces him of his 'destined' place in the society. With everyone around him refusing to let him have a shred of dignity and self-respect (except of course, his sister and friends), he has little to go on and till the point he hears Gandhi's words, he appears to be spiraling downwards from a high point of apathetic acceptance in the beginning to an anguished defeat at the hands of his 'fate' of being a latrine cleaner all his life, surviving on food picked up from the streets and the sahibs' leftovers, forcefully excluded from any chances to play hockey (something he is exceptionally good at), to be educated (at the hands of two little upper caste boys) or any stray chance to raise his head high without an inexplicable shame and hesitation weighing him down. The misery of Bakha hits all the more strongly when the reader follows his thought process in which he constantly questions his so-called 'fate' and end up with unjustifiable yet, valid realizations of his social standing. He is a perfect example of a wasted potential which never fails to mark its presence and yet, never evolves. I don't know if any other book reveals the hypocrisy of an orthodox Hindu society better than Anand's 'Untouchable' but nonetheless, the book is a great read. Anand's writing style is easy and poetic with beautiful vivid description of both pictures as well as emotions."

I only remember hearing and reading about the phenomenon of untouchability in Hindu society, when growing up in India during the 70s and early 80s. It still exists to a certain extent in parts of India, or at least spoken about, as I have heard mention of it conversation with others in my family. Gandhiji is attributed to saying in this book - ‘the fault does not lie in the Hindu religion, but in those who profess it’. I couldn’t agree any more. A short story, and a brief glimpse in the life of an untouchable. A difficult issue simply, sometimes touchingly, described in this story by Mulk Raj Anand, one of the first English writing Indian authors."

I went into this extremely uneducated, largely due to the British education system’s whitewashed and selective history topics but also my ignorance, so if like me, you are not aware of what the caste system is, it is a system as debilitating as an apartheid. This led to untouchability. This novel is short but impactful. I am not sure of the intentions beyond raising an issue that very few, if any, individuals were largely discussing at a distressing and controversial time but it does the job indeed. However, perhaps due to ignorance again, it is quite difficult to follow if you do not have an understanding of or even experience of India and its culture. I think for any reader who is perhaps not as educated as they could be, this will be a very middling read. It is incredibly interesting and emotive but the lack of description and narration that offers deeper insight meant that I could not love it as much as I would have liked due to this - which was a huge shame."

From the point of view of a sweeper, contact with Brahmins and other higher cast Hindus is fraught with peril, as accidentally touching a Brahmin can cause a riot, and in this book almost does at two points, once involving the hero, Bakha, and once involving his sister. Untouchable was written in English and published in 1935, while India was still a British Crown Colony. Bakha is drawn to the English and likes to imitate them, admiring their openness in dealing with a mere sweeper. This book is an eye-opener to one who, like me, has never been to India. The whole concept of people in lower castes contact with whom can pollute you and require prayers and ablutions leading to purification ... such a concept is so alien to me. If the condition of these Dalits, as they are also called, is still the same more than 80 years after this book, then India has a difficult task ahead adjusting to more egalitarian cultures. This is a superb book and deserves to be read, both as a work of literature and an impassioned plea for lightening the load of millions of Hindus in the lower castes."

In the first, there is a world most of humanity is scared of touching even by accident some people - there is no visible reason for it, but the fear is real. Not only you can't touch the person, but you also can't touch things they have touched And this is a source of humiliation for those that can't be touched. In the second, half the population of the world is raised with the idea that the mere sight of their body is an offense to decency. I could go on - and talk about other such worlds - one where guns are left out in open and books are kept in shelves under locks but these whole social issues talk presented as dystopia talk has started boring me already. My point is untouchability is one of those things that should seem too fantastic if it was something imagined and not real - a bit like slavery that way. Mulk Raj Anand's novella was powerful even for me though, being an Indian, I knew its evils. It shocks me that it is not read more by western readers to whom some scenes would seem really dystopian. The first 70 percent of the novella is quite powerful - even trying to capture its protagonist's stream of consciousness at times. Later, it does turn contemplative though (I have no problem with that but it can be a turn-off for many readers); it seems to conclude that the solutions like conversion to Christianity, Gandhi, or having western toilets can solve the problem. Unfortunately, that's far from the case. A few weeks back, some upper-caste children at government schools refused to eat food prepared by lower-caste workers. Untouchability had nothing to do with the kind of work people did; it is born of the privileged too willing to think lowly of others in order to think better of themselves."

It has a message that gets presented through a sensitive and nuanced portrayal of Bakha as a complex human being with limits and aspirations. He clearly strives to attain a life beyond his station, adopting Western dress from the second-hand and discarded motley of British military clothing that he wears and even his style of sleeping. Still, the attitudes and behaviors of his position are woven into his everyday thoughts and actions. The humiliation and physical abuse that come when forgetting his place or seeking to take liberties beyond it are always imminent, there to remind him. Several such episodes of this are dramatized in the plot of the book, set in a single day: Bakha absent-mindedly brushes against a man who makes a spectacle of berating him and later causes a commotion when he approaches too close to a Hindu temple to observe the liturgy taking place. Mulk Raj Anand depicts him experiencing a wide range of emotions - exalted upon receiving a used field hockey stick, resentful at the favoritism his father shows his younger brother, curious but confused in an encounter with a Salvation Army colonel - in an unsentimental way that reinforces how much Bakha is like anyone else, if not for the plight that keeps him from being as full a person as he might be. The end of the novel features an interesting succession of figures - including an appearance by Gandhi himself - who offer reflections about the problem of untouchability and the future of India, slipping politics in explicitly but not obtrusively. I hadn't known anything about this author before but now am inclined to check out his novel \"Private Life of an Indian Prince\" and the autobiographical novels mentioned in the author bio."

Bakha starts his day working \"earnestly, quickly, without loss of effort\". He dreams of the day he will be able to do the work of his father, the head of all the local sweepers and who is responsible for cleaning the streets of the town and the temple courtyard. His wish is fulfilled that very day when his father becomes ill, and he sends Bakha to do his job. The actual horror of the position of an Untouchable emerges as we see Bakha's sister wait in line with others of her caste for a kind hearted upper caste person who will take the time to fill her water jug; as we watch Bakha, overwhelmed by the sights on the street, forget to call to warn of his approach and accidentally touch a high-caste man. The \"Lalla\" proceeds to vilify Bakha: \"Do you know you have touched me and defiled me, you cock-eyed son of a bow-legged scorpion! Now I will have to go and take a bath to purify myself. And it was a new dhoti and shirt I put on this morning!\" And Bakha's day does not improve. He is thrown off the steps of the temple where wandered to listen to the prayers and try to see into the temple although he knew his presence would \"pollute\" the temple and it would then have to undergo a purification ceremony. He must then go to a row of houses to beg for bread for his family. When finally some is thrown to him, it falls to the ground where he picks it up to bring it home to his father, sister and brother. Bakha actually displays a love of life that is momentarily depressed by these events, but which rises to the fore over and over. At the end of the day, Bakha is mystified by a Christian missionary who tries to \"save\" him from his untouchability through Jesus, an unexpected opportunity to hear (but not understand) the great Mahatma Gandhi expound his ideas for changing Indian society, and a local dandy explaining the ultimate solution to the problem of the untouchables--flush toilets. Bakha ruminates on the meaning of it all. Hopeful again, he turns for home to tell his father about Gandhi and the new machine--the flush toilets. \"Untouchable\" was a contemporary story. It is still a stirring account of the basic humanity of those members of the lowest castes of Indian society, and the wretchedness of their lives."

Later I have eventually known him as an eminent Indian fiction writer in English, a contemporary of R. K. Narayan, Ahmad Ali (Pakistani) and Raja Rao ( https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Mulk_Ra... ) whose pioneering English novels based on Indian rural life and plight started to gain international readership around 1930s-1960s. As for me, I have long known and read only R. K. Narayan due to probably his literary popularity and availability of his new reprints or second-hand books in Thailand. Coming to think of giving the others more credit and attention, I think I would read him more as well as Ahmad Ali and Raja Rao whenever I can find their interesting works. I found reading this fiction illuminatingly entertaining and objectively narrated since it has explored the life of an 18-year-old Indian outcaste named Bakha, an Untouchable in the Indian caste system, who works as a sweeper and latrine-cleaner. We can see that such menial toil is bitterly despised due to its filthiness, disgrace and dishonor, in other words, people tend to look down upon them as those in the low society or the lower class; they thinking they are in the high society or in the upper class. However, the author has amazingly revealed his literary expertise by means of his narratives tinged with his sense of humor in which we can enjoy reading with some tongue-in-cheek words in the extracts that follow: He shivered as he turned on his side. But he didn't mind the cold very much, suffering it willingly because he could sacrifice a good many comforts for the sake of what he called 'fashun', by which he understood the art of wearing trousers, breeches, coat, puttees, boots, etc. as worn by the British and Indian soldiers in India. (p. 12) Almost a model 'gentreman', Bakha thought him, the kind of person he admired and wanted to imitate. (p. 39) And he had felt a burning desire, while he was in the British barracks, to speak the tish-mish, tish-mish which the Tommies spoke. (p. 44) Moreover, his text also include an unexpected usage of word like 'attack' denoting Bakha's action in the context, rather than an attempt to cause damage to enemy ( https:\/\/en.wiktionary.org\/wiki\/attack... such a usage surprisingly being rarely found in other novels, especially the third excerpt in which I couldn't help wondering at first reading how he 'attacked' the package in question or if it's Dr. Anand's satire-like sense of humor, for instance: He hardly realized that he had lapsed into activity, so vigorously did he attack his job. (p. 23) He was a bit scared by the sudden unwinding of the wheel. Then he pulled himself together and renewed his attack. (p. 32) His mouth was watering. He unfolded the paper in which the jalebis were wrapped and put a piece hastily in his mouth. The taste of the warm and sweet syrup was satisfying and delightful. He attacked the package again. (p. 52) In conclusion, this novel is arguably worth reading due to its exceptional writing style, seemingly realistic plot as well as amazingly appropriate word choices in which you can enjoy and enrich your lexicons while reading on and on. Decidedly, I would find his other books and look forward to reading them more."

Unaccounted for anonymous millions, 4 centuries. But alas like every other literary theme on the planet, brutalization of human beings, too, has its color-coded hierarchical positions within the canon. The sweeper is worse off than a slave, for the slave may change his master and his duties and may even become free, but the sweeper is bound forever, born into a state from which he cannot escape and where he is excluded from social intercourse and the consolations of his religion. So slavery. A word which no longer evokes the kind of knee-jerk instinctual horror or pathos that it should and has descended into the realms of banality through repeated use over the years. And yet the word refuses to become just another obsolete dictionary entry with its persistent reappearances before us in myriad new grotesque avatars. Forced prostitution, human trafficking, slavery of illegal immigrant workers, bonded labor and so on and so forth. Our own home-made brand of slavery-segregation went by the label of 'untouchability', another convenient, religion-sanctioned writ flagrantly upheld by authorities. Quote obscure mumbo jumbo from scriptures, invent excuses to justify your irrational bias and manipulate the system into giving 'religion' free reign and tada your status quo has been manufactured. He realised he couldn't rush even though the Mahatma had abolished all caste distinctions for the day. He might touch someone and then there would be a scene. The Mahatma would be too far away to come and help him. One can call this work a thinly disguised attempt at political pamphleteering because there is very little literary merit to be found here. No linguistic shenanigans to express apoplectic joy over. No dazzling imagery to wax eloquent about. A book named 'Untouchable' on an untouchable latrine-cleaner can boast of no thematic subtlety either. To add to these causes of botheration, Anand devotes a portion to the exaltation of Gandhi who had initially felt the necessity of vindicating the caste system (probably to forestall criticism of Hinduism) despite championing the cause of the harijan ('untouchable'). If you have read enough Arundhati Roy or are aware of her political views, you probably know what I am talking about. So yes this novel is a product of a time and the awakening collective consciousness of an emerging nation-state. It is unable to reconcile an essentially hostile social milieu to the aspirations of an enlightened new generation and merely musters up a robust optimism for the foreseeable future. But it added to a much needed discourse at a time when it was in short supply. So there. Of course, caste-based violence is still a regularly resurfacing news item and stigmatization of crematorium\/graveyard workers, garbage-collectors and assorted dregs of society has not been completely obliterated. But the normalization of the relentless verbal and physical abuse that Bakha, our 'untouchable' protagonist, is subjected to in the book has long been discontinued. Unable to love it whole-heartedly as I was, I am still painfully aware of this book's relevance. May we be forgiven for passive participation in the ritual dehumanization of a section of society but may we never forget."

        "text":"Soul crushing. We in the West know nothing about degradation. The strife and misery of this narrative! And yet the writing is captivating, the modulation of emotion through action and image masterful. A novel of people whose very essence, they’ve been told for thousands of years, is defilement. I must read more on caste and how it came to be. It’s incomprehensible to the Western mind. Bakha, a strong young man, a sweeper of latrines, has spent time at the British barracks, where he was treated as if he possessed no taint. This has broadened his thinking, shown him the imbecility of the millennia-old system he lived under, and made him feel things could be different than they are. Bakha and his kind are, among other indecencies, deprived of education, fed like swine, denied participation in community, and consigned to wretched quarters. As the story progresses, and Bakha is assailed from all quarters with declarations of “pollution, pollution!” That this handsome and industrious young man should on this day, perhaps for the first time, truly feel the proportions of the terrible trap that is his life, makes for a terrible moment. He was part of a consciousness which he could share and yet not understand. He had been lifted from the gutter, through the barriers of space, to partake of life which was his, and yet not his. He was in the midst of a humanity which included him in its folds and yet debarred him from entering into a sentient, living, quivering contact with it. (p. 137) The Mahatma shows up with a message tailor made for Bakha. It’s a subtle bit of didacticism in which one is reminded of certain harangues of Dostoyevsky . Fortunately it’s brief. Untouchability was prohibited by law some 65 years ago. But it is said that Indian elections still reflect a caste consciousness. How could they not, after millennia under such a system? The book, scatological in the extreme, is deeply moving, mainly due to the rage it evokes in the reader. It is also utterly without parallel in my reading experience. That is, I’ve never read anything else that even touches on the subject in the headlong manner this does. PS Guess who helped Anand with his novel? His initials are M.G. PPS If you’re going to read this you must also read B.R. Ambedkar’s Annihilation of Caste , fascinating."

He wanted to warm his flesh; he wanted the warmth to get behind the scales of the dry, powdery surface that had formed on his fingers; he wanted the blood in the blue veins that stood out on the back of his hand to melt.\" You know, in a memoir of his first story “Lost child”, Mulkraj Anand mentioned that he dared to show his story to Virginia Woolf. She asked him to read it out in her next home party. Desmond Macarthy, Victoria Sackill West, Edward Garnet, clapped after he read his story. During that time, in one of her pamphlets, Virginia Woolf attacked many novelists like Arnold Bennet, H G Wells, John Galsworthy, for writing about the characters of sub- world. This shocked Mulkraj because he was planning to write this novel about the untouchable people. He was further demotivated when one of the young poets, after knowing that Mulkraj was going to write about his growing up years among tough boys, sons of bandsmen, washer men and sweepers, said, leave your Cockneys in their sordid world….As we ignore the Russian writer Gorky’s ‘Lower depths’; write like Laurence Hope about flowers in garden Shalimar! Then coming back to India, Mulkraj wrote this novel under the guidance of Gandhi. Gandhi advised him not to use big english words and to use the local language. This is story of a sweeper named Bakha, a young and intelligent character. Through the ordeals and activities of life of Bakha, his family, his friends and other characters writer has given a wonderful but tyrannical imagery of those days when the untouchability was a great challenge in Indian society. He has depicted very artfully the conflicts between the high caste and lower caste people in the society and has finally reached to the argument that the untouchability was inhumane. Bakha is a representative of down trodden in the pre-independent era of India. He suffers because of his caste and all the lower castes people are suffering because they are by birth outcaste. Writer has depicted the hypocrisy of the upper caste people that men like Pt. Kali Nath enjoy the touch of the lower caste girls, but do not treat lower caste people equally in other matters. He has exposed all this hypocrisy and double standards. Bakha has been portrayed as a universal figure to show the oppression, injustice, humiliation to the whole community of the outcastes in India in this book. An attractively written story by Anand, proving a fact that social exclusion and exploitation of the subaltern is well rooted in the caste system of India ! An outcast was not allowed to enter into the house of higher caste, even when food was required in utmost urgency… \"For being an outcaste he could not insult the sanctity of the house by climbing on the house on the top floors where the kitchens were, but had to shout and announce his arrival from below. ‘Bread for the sweeper mother bread for the sweeper,’ He called standing in the door of the first house. His voice died down to the echo of ‘thak, thak, thak’, which stole into the alley. ‘The sweeper has come for the bread, mother!” he shouted a little louder. But it was of no avail. He penetrated further into the alley and standing near a point where the doors of four houses were near each other, He shouted his call: ‘Bread for the sweeper, mother; bread for the sweeper.’ Yet no one seemed to hear him on the tops of the house.\""

        "text":"This is only a short book and the first two-thirds are quite interesting - a day in the life of a downtrodden Untouchable latrine cleaner and his rat-eating family. The preaching of the last third rather spoiled it though. It is true that flush lavatories would solve the problem for the toilet-cleaning caste, but it is hardly a solution for the Untouchables, no matter what name Gandhi gave them. Part of the problem of the Untouchable caste is that it isn't actually a problem at all for anyone who isn't Untouchable, in fact it's desirable to have them. Since they, the pariahs of society, do all the work that no one else wants to do, and at minimum wage, and all this exploitation can be justified as being in the name of religion, in the name of not interfering with the Infinite plan there is no impetus from society to improve these people's lives. It's not so far from the way the US treats illegal Mexican immigrants. It allows them to stay to do the work that no one else wants to do for those wages in those conditions. They live in fear of everything and everyone. If they are beaten, robbed or raped they have no redress. They daren't complain. So just as with the Untouchables not being a problem if you aren't one, neither are the illegal immigrants. In the UK, it is different. An illegal immigrant can either 'disappear' as in the US or claim asylum and is immediately housed and given an allowance for years while his case is 'considered'. If he loses but by then has a child here or would face discrimination in his own country, he can claim that deportation would breach his human rights. The gvt. will then pay for a lawyer to fight for him. If he wins, he can then bring in his family. There are two ways, from a religious point of view, of looking at them. Either they must have done something pretty dreadful in their previous lives to get born an Untouchable and this is Divine punishment, or alternatively, these people must have been really good dogs, cockroaches or whathaveyou to have become human in this life and who are mere humans to interfere with this great Cycle? When looked at in this way, it's a pretty clever organising of society, of religion, to get the work done. Another way of putting it, one more familiar to us, is the richer get richer and the poor live in ghettos and clean the houses, shops, subways and streets for them. One of the solutions proposed is Christianity, which has the great advantage of not having a rebirth system so a lowly caste becomes a class problem for which education can provide a ladder up and out. Another solution, one partly in effect now, was Gandhi's renaming the caste Harijan, or Children of God, and his movement to include rather exclude them from society. The third solution isn't sadly as widespread as it ought to be, the flush toilet. The poor who live and sleep on the pavements still shit in the gutter, those living in slums and tenements crap into plastic bags which they launch far into the air earning them the nickname of parachutes and those slightly less poor than that have flush toilets but no running water. So whether its cleaning latrines or cleaning (un)flushed toilets, or sweeping the streets clean of 'parachute' bags, this caste of Untouchables, these Children of God, are still plying their traditional trade. Sometimes I wonder if everything evil under the sun couldn't find its justification in one religion or another? I don't like being lectured to, and I don't care what literary device is used to pretend that it's just the story not a didactic excursion by the author, I just don't like it. I would probably never have finished the book but my computer broke down and it took an hour to fix with all the endless waits while it checked files and rebooted. Lucky aren't I, to have a bookshop and only a slightly iffy computer to annoy me rather than having to live with broken flush toilets and crap to clean from the streets?

        "text":"A single event in the life of an untouchable toilet-cleaner, pressed into child labour due to illness in the family. It is stretched into a book, with every detail etched out. Why is it so poignant? Because we know, without it being explicitly told to us, that this is it, this is his life - it is going to be a life of repetitions, of insults piled on insults, of gradual deadening of the senses, of childhood worn away into an early old age, of bitterness and submission, of daily degradation. Until nothing remains other than another faceless untouchable, to be ignored and despised. Bakha tries hard to rise above his social standing, Mulk Raj Anand exhibiting his trademark humanism, by showcasing the essential dignity of even such a depraved condition. How? By showing us the mind - the human mind in almost any depravity retains its nobility, but only to an extent, it is perhaps hinted... In naive child-like enthusiasm, Bakha dares to dream, but we see how he is going to be worn down every day. We experience a very small bit of his life, and even though he doesn't know it, we can see that the many indignities and outrages he suffer are things he will soon grow immune to and learn to take as his lot. We know that is the problem. The ironical highpoint of the book is when Mahatma comes to Bakha's village. Mahatma comes to inspire, to uplift. Bakha was even able to catch a glimpse and hear his words. But nothing happens because of this climactic moment. Life continues, and this has been the case - despite much upliftment, the lot of the lower caste has not seen much change over the centuries. They still struggle on, noble in mind or not. This is a novella with the punch of a compact short story. It hits hard without even taking a swing. A note on the translation: When\"oye, saale!\" is translated as \"oye, brother-in-law!\" no sane Indian reader can avoid a barf. It grows very tiring to keep hearing everyone addressed as \"brother-in-law\" every few lines. I hope a new edition of the book will just substitute this jarring usage with \"saala\" and maybe add a footnote to explain the meaning and significance of the word."

I like this book for it made me feel the actual anger of the young main character and the different range of emotions which went high and low as he wanted me to experience while he was going through all the abuse, assualt and insults. This is the story of Bakha, who is an eighteen year old, belonging to a lower caste whose family of sweepers and latrine cleaners. Brought up by his neglectful and violent father alongwith his two other siblings, Bakha works hard from dawn facing all kinds of harrassment and abusive people belonging to other caste. He had to go through hunger, shame and pain most days. What was most striking about the story is the way how rational and realistic the young character is inspite of the events that happened to him and the situation he was in, both outside and inside his home. The story is what you would expect: how the 'untouchables' belonging to lower caste suffered and struggled during those days, facing humiliation all their lives for no fault of theirs. However, it is not an easy read for me. The writing is easy to follow but it has layers of emotions and expressions that would be subjected to different kinds of reaction from different readers. The second half became intense as compared to the first half as it turned into political speeches, talks about Gandhi's thoughts on several issues of inequality and destroying caste. It was eye-opening for me and I enjoyed it. But I wanted a better ending. Worth the read. I would say it would be a bit difficult for beginners otherwise give it a try. Warnings for SA, domestic violence and abuse."

Enlarge the picture in the book's cover so you can get a good look at him, the photo courtesy of the India Office Library and Records. A flesh and blood Untouchable with god-given superhuman powers. Here are some amazing things he is capable of: 1. He can part a throng of people with just the words: \"Posh, posh, sweeper coming!\" as he comes carrying his broom (cf. Moses with his stick, parting the Red Sea); 2. Just by his touch, whether done intentionally or accidentally, another person would become very angry and will call him a dog, a swine, a cock-eyed son of a bow-legged scorpion, an offspring of a pig, and so on; 3. With the same touch, even with his smallest finger, he can defile another person so that even if the latter is on his way to an important appointment and is running late, for example, he'll have to go back home to wash and purify himself; 4. His powers are carried over also by the inanimate objects he touches. If he's buying something from a store, for example, the vendor will first ask him to put his money on a bowl, which shall then be purified by washing it with water, before the vendor shall handle it; 5. He passes on his magical powers to his children; and 6. He can live without hope, be dead inside yet do his predestined chores. Look at him: his bare feet, his shapeless pants, the rags he wears, his cheap turban, his basket where he puts in the dung and dirt he sweeps from the street and collects from latrines. He is not bad-looking, physically, with his athletic built, his height, his finely-shaped nose, full lips--but look at his eyes. A lifeless pair, turned into stone by the misery of his fate. He is the lowest of the low-caste Untouchables of India; street-sweeper, latrine-cleaner, collector of human and animal waste. This is a novel about this superhero named Bakha (quite appropriate: \"Baka\" in Tagalog is cow, and cows are the holiest of animals in India). But this is more than just a story of a day in his life. This is a novel about a superhero written by another superhero:, Mulk Raj Anand--he who has this other super power called Compassion. He could not have seen Bakha for what he really was, and write about him with controlled fury, if he did not have this divine gift. The most extraordinary feats in human history are achieved not by the strong but by those with Compassion."

I read some other reviews saying this novel is about an interesting topic but it is not written in the right way. Well, there is nothing sexy about Indian poverty. It is the most desperate poverty in the world, full of squalor. It is insufferable. It is everywhere. No Bruce Springsteen songs to romanticize it. No Charles Bukowski novels filled with crazy individualists. Danny Boyle did his bit for the urban Indian poor. But Indian poverty goes on and on. Even the richest of Indians have felt like Bakha, every once in a while. You could be the most privileged Indian. But you might find yourself in situations Bakha finds himself in. That scene in the novel in which Bakha is sexually attracted to his own sister, while feeling offended that the upper caste men in the village are also eyeing her ..... I don't know what to say. Not many writers can be that honest and devastating. Decades later, the situations in this novel still exist all around me."

From there it is all downhill. His father feigns an injury and sends Bakha to perform his own sweeping duties, and events unfold from there. I enjoyed this book while it was following Bakha's day, but I thought it lost form at the end where Gandhi makes an appearance to give a public lecture. Here it becomes a lecture to the reader, one that the main character himself only understands a small amount of. For me the end of the book didn't give closure - I won't go into detail, as there would be spoilers, but the story just sort of ran out of steam. 3 stars."

Sweeper coming through!’ This is the cry of the latrine cleaner\/road sweeper as he navigates his way through the crowded streets warning of his approach so people can avoid being touched and thereby polluted, requiring immediate and extensive cleansing and purification. For Bakha the latrine cleaner cannot touch or be touched. He is an untouchable. He lives with his widowed father Lakha, sister Sohini and younger brother Rakha. They clean the latrines and sweep the road for the local regiment. Importantly they are treated by the soldiers not as pariahs, but people employed to do unpleasant menial work. Bakha’s family is well established in the community, so they know the sahibs, sepoys and the other untouchables. Although I had something of an idea of what untouchable meant this story opened my eyes to the all-embracing nature of this Hindu brand of slavery cum segregation, full of abuse and insults and impossible to escape, at least in 1935, when the book was published. Bakha’s younger sister Sohini goes to the village well to collect water for the family, but must wait in the heat for others to draw their supply, and indeed cannot draw the water herself, but must rely on a person from a higher caste to draw the water on her behalf. It’s a long wait. Sohini is picked on by an older jealous woman, food is thrown and Sohini is rescued by a priest at the temple only to be molested. It should be noted that Bakha and his sister are beautiful people: young, strong, healthy and attractive, but this does not help them, in fact it probably makes the way they are treated worse. One of the Indians at the barracks, Havildar Charat Singh, of a higher caste, is a famous street hockey player who gives Bakha an old hockey stick, which would otherwise be out of his reach. While filled with gratitude, Bakha soon realises that people will think he stole it. A terrible tale of organised repression: the saddest aspect being the inevitability of Bakha becoming inured to his lot as he ages and his youthful buoyancy deflates."

Also, the dialogues had a larger impact on me when I mentally translated them in Hindi, that is an area the writer cannot alter and I understand that.

Realizing the truth about the Harijans in that era of British Raj seems to be as the worse among whole period. The Brahmans were actually the root cause of such conditions in Indian Society. Discrimination among the humans in regard of the castes started with them only. No shudra can enter the temple, can't touch anybody. From the perspective of Dalits at that time, it seems to be very irritating and frustrating. These things were exist in some other cultures also, say, Burakumin in Japan; but still the condition here in India was worst. Caste is the biggest back-bone breaking step taken by British by instilling this system in Hindus of India. Dividing Hindus in micro-level statuses basis on their work and then further bifurcate it into more drastic societal status-quo manner. And what Gandhi did? Nothing .. just expanding more gaps in-between the existing castes. In the name of Equality he did nothing but just igniting the fire between upper and lower castes, as defined in the Indian society by British. And why not?, After-all Gandhi was customarily planned back in India from Africa after he made sure there, for British Empire, that Whites could rule over African blacks. Same way here in India he expand the gaps between people by highlighting their castes and made them believe that the people who are living along with them in society hate them only because they did some usual generations back work which eventually titled by British as lower level job of society. However, in their Christian country of Britain they even allow Janitors to attend churches but here they broke our harmonious society. Can't imagine the humility one can feel when he\/she get the leftover of some other person and how does it feel when someone give you any edible item by throwing it on the streets. Mr. Anand had really done a great job with his pen. Exposing the conditions of untouchables of that time was in itself a very brave and bold act. He reminds me of 'Raja Ravi Varma', who had gifted with his art, to the people of lower caste, the way of worshiping the GOD (idolaters). However the story drafted was an act of fiction but still its reflecting the realistic thoughts and realism in society at that time. Very well written, this work of fiction gives immense peace while reading it, even when, I myself, comes from the Upper (Unreserved General Category) caste in the present society system which started\/titled with this discriminating system far back.

With an afterword by E.M. Forster , this powerful work grapples with outsized issues of prejudice, religion, destiny, and offers some insight into tactics to overcome the system. The 2014 introduction provides important context for developments since the time of the novel. Gandhi is discussed in the forward, and appears in the novel. Apparently he was an influence on Anand. Most of the novel closely follows the sweeper Bakha, who cleans latrines and sweeps refuse from the streets. Bakha is uneducated — because he is not permitted to attend school (where he would pollute the other students). Bakha is confused by religion — because he is forbidden to enter a temple (because of pollution, etc.) Late in the book, in a moment of turmoil, Bakha encounters a Christian missionary who has adopted elements of native dress and attempted to learn the language: \"But the edge of his tongue was like a pair of scissors which cut the pattern of Hindustani into smithereens as a parrot snips his food into bits.\" The missionary provides an excuse to explore the power of Christianity to improve the lives of the underclass, but Bakha is left confused. Next up, Gandhi. The text in the late stages diverges from a clean focus on Baker's life into a muddy exploration of philosophy, and that somewhat detracts from the literary merit of the novel. What else to do, though? How else to impose this important discussion on the reader?"

        "text":"It is comfortably easy to argue against the practice of untouchability when one isn't at the receiving end. Mulk Raj Anand erases that gulf and puts the reader right into the uncomfortable and worn down ammunition shoes of Bakha, an eighteen year old manual scavenger. The book is relatively short, accounting for only a day in Bakha's life. And Anand ensures that a single day is enough. The arguments against the practice normally revolve around the socio-economic (and sometimes, political) aspect of the oppression. But 'Untouchable' takes a step closer to the individual from the collective and highlights the psychological scars that are inherited by every new generation of the outcastes's community. Bakha isn't your typical fierce, fearless and determined protagonist in spite of the fact that he has the potential to be one. There are multiple instances where his instinctual repulsion to the social setup around him, that includes him in its fold only to trample upon him and others like him, becomes obvious and painfully thwarted by a faulty reasoning that convinces him of his 'destined' place in the society. With everyone around him refusing to let him have a shred of dignity and self-respect (except of course, his sister and friends), he has little to go on and till the point he hears Gandhi's words, he appears to be spiraling downwards from a high point of apathetic acceptance in the beginning to an anguished defeat at the hands of his 'fate' of being a latrine cleaner all his life, surviving on food picked up from the streets and the sahibs' leftovers, forcefully excluded from any chances to play hockey (something he is exceptionally good at), to be educated (at the hands of two little upper caste boys) or any stray chance to raise his head high without an inexplicable shame and hesitation weighing him down. The misery of Bakha hits all the more strongly when the reader follows his thought process in which he constantly questions his so-called 'fate' and end up with unjustifiable yet, valid realizations of his social standing. He is a perfect example of a wasted potential which never fails to mark its presence and yet, never evolves. I don't know if any other book reveals the hypocrisy of an orthodox Hindu society better than Anand's 'Untouchable' but nonetheless, the book is a great read. Anand's writing style is easy and poetic with beautiful vivid description of both pictures as well as emotions."

        "text":"A day in the life of Bakha the Jemadar (sweeper), and an untouchable. The heart of the book is about the social stigma of untouchability affecting India during the 1930s - the period when this book was written and also the time setting for the story as well. I only remember hearing and reading about the phenomenon of untouchability in Hindu society, when growing up in India during the 70s and early 80s. It still exists to a certain extent in parts of India, or at least spoken about, as I have heard mention of it conversation with others in my family. Gandhiji is attributed to saying in this book - ‘the fault does not lie in the Hindu religion, but in those who profess it’. I couldn’t agree any more. A short story, and a brief glimpse in the life of an untouchable. A difficult issue simply, sometimes touchingly, described in this story by Mulk Raj Anand, one of the first English writing Indian authors."

        "text":"Untouchable tells the story of Bakha, a young untouchable, who is an outcast in India’s caste system. I went into this extremely uneducated, largely due to the British education system’s whitewashed and selective history topics but also my ignorance, so if like me, you are not aware of what the caste system is, it is a system as debilitating as an apartheid. This led to untouchability. This novel is short but impactful. I am not sure of the intentions beyond raising an issue that very few, if any, individuals were largely discussing at a distressing and controversial time but it does the job indeed. However, perhaps due to ignorance again, it is quite difficult to follow if you do not have an understanding of or even experience of India and its culture. I think for any reader who is perhaps not as educated as they could be, this will be a very middling read. It is incredibly interesting and emotive but the lack of description and narration that offers deeper insight meant that I could not love it as much as I would have liked due to this - which was a huge shame."

        "text":"Mulk Raj Anand's Untouchable is a novel about a day in the life of one of India's lowest untouchables, sweepers who clean up the excreta left by the poor who do not have access to toilets or even outhouses. From the point of view of a sweeper, contact with Brahmins and other higher cast Hindus is fraught with peril, as accidentally touching a Brahmin can cause a riot, and in this book almost does at two points, once involving the hero, Bakha, and once involving his sister. Untouchable was written in English and published in 1935, while India was still a British Crown Colony. Bakha is drawn to the English and likes to imitate them, admiring their openness in dealing with a mere sweeper. This book is an eye-opener to one who, like me, has never been to India. The whole concept of people in lower castes contact with whom can pollute you and require prayers and ablutions leading to purification ... such a concept is so alien to me. If the condition of these Dalits, as they are also called, is still the same more than 80 years after this book, then India has a difficult task ahead adjusting to more egalitarian cultures. This is a superb book and deserves to be read, both as a work of literature and an impassioned plea for lightening the load of millions of Hindus in the lower castes."

        "text":"It's a great book. It is about a day in the life of an untouchable - Bakha. Halfway through the book the story seems ordinary, but the unthinkable ending takes it to another level. Although, for the ones who are reading Mulkh Raj Anand’s book for the first time will be sort of disappointed. The author is known to use Hindustani words in his novels. But in this novel he has translated literal meanings of some words. So while reading, you will come across characters calling 'brother-in-law' to others. It’s a turn off for those who don’t know Hindi. It would have made a good difference if the author had chosen to use the hindi word 'Saale' instead. All in all, it’s good enough to get you to explore more of Mulk Raj Anand's world."

        "text":"I give you two ideas of dystopias. In the first, there is a world most of humanity is scared of touching even by accident some people - there is no visible reason for it, but the fear is real. Not only you can't touch the person, but you also can't touch things they have touched And this is a source of humiliation for those that can't be touched. In the second, half the population of the world is raised with the idea that the mere sight of their body is an offense to decency. I could go on - and talk about other such worlds - one where guns are left out in open and books are kept in shelves under locks but these whole social issues talk presented as dystopia talk has started boring me already. My point is untouchability is one of those things that should seem too fantastic if it was something imagined and not real - a bit like slavery that way. Mulk Raj Anand's novella was powerful even for me though, being an Indian, I knew its evils. It shocks me that it is not read more by western readers to whom some scenes would seem really dystopian. The first 70 percent of the novella is quite powerful - even trying to capture its protagonist's stream of consciousness at times. Later, it does turn contemplative though (I have no problem with that but it can be a turn-off for many readers); it seems to conclude that the solutions like conversion to Christianity, Gandhi, or having western toilets can solve the problem. Unfortunately, that's far from the case. A few weeks back, some upper-caste children at government schools refused to eat food prepared by lower-caste workers. Untouchability had nothing to do with the kind of work people did; it is born of the privileged too willing to think lowly of others in order to think better of themselves."

        "text":"Written in 1935, this novel is told from the perspective of Bakha, a sweeper, of the lowest level of the outcaste Untouchables. It has a message that gets presented through a sensitive and nuanced portrayal of Bakha as a complex human being with limits and aspirations. He clearly strives to attain a life beyond his station, adopting Western dress from the second-hand and discarded motley of British military clothing that he wears and even his style of sleeping. Still, the attitudes and behaviors of his position are woven into his everyday thoughts and actions. The humiliation and physical abuse that come when forgetting his place or seeking to take liberties beyond it are always imminent, there to remind him. Several such episodes of this are dramatized in the plot of the book, set in a single day: Bakha absent-mindedly brushes against a man who makes a spectacle of berating him and later causes a commotion when he approaches too close to a Hindu temple to observe the liturgy taking place. Mulk Raj Anand depicts him experiencing a wide range of emotions - exalted upon receiving a used field hockey stick, resentful at the favoritism his father shows his younger brother, curious but confused in an encounter with a Salvation Army colonel - in an unsentimental way that reinforces how much Bakha is like anyone else, if not for the plight that keeps him from being as full a person as he might be. The end of the novel features an interesting succession of figures - including an appearance by Gandhi himself - who offer reflections about the problem of untouchability and the future of India, slipping politics in explicitly but not obtrusively. I hadn't known anything about this author before but now am inclined to check out his novel \"Private Life of an Indian Prince\" and the autobiographical novels mentioned in the author bio."

Reading in between the time when I finished other books and was getting a new one, I had to recall whatever happened till the pages I had read. so we can conclude that this book didn't leave much of an impression on my mind or memory. anyways I read it because I wanted to read a book by Mulk raj Anand and moreover the topic seemed quite a different one than the usual ones. It talks about a day in the life of an untouchable and how he actually sees the world treating himself and finds his answers afetr all the problems he goes through. We all have bad days and we all look for answers to the big problems we face and how world treats us whether as being a women, being poor, being uneducated, being out of place, being unclued to the topic being discussed or being lonely or like being untouchable. and we all get over it - find some logic or reason to how this happened and learn to cope with it just like Bhakha in this book. So read on because we all are liek Bhakha but in our different social sections or zones."

The writing is wonderful and the way the author has occasionally peppered it with humour is brilliant. Otherwise, it would have been thoroughly painful to read a book with such a depressing theme. The protagonist Bakha was also a likeable creation. Whether an indian or not, I think everyone should read this book atleast once. It shall let you know how ignorance can turn humans into heartless fanatics and show you a picture of Indian society which hasn't really undergone much improvement."

Bakha starts his day working \"earnestly, quickly, without loss of effort\". He dreams of the day he will be able to do the work of his father, the head of all the local sweepers and who is responsible for cleaning the streets of the town and the temple courtyard. His wish is fulfilled that very day when his father becomes ill, and he sends Bakha to do his job. The actual horror of the position of an Untouchable emerges as we see Bakha's sister wait in line with others of her caste for a kind hearted upper caste person who will take the time to fill her water jug; as we watch Bakha, overwhelmed by the sights on the street, forget to call to warn of his approach and accidentally touch a high-caste man. The \"Lalla\" proceeds to vilify Bakha: \"Do you know you have touched me and defiled me, you cock-eyed son of a bow-legged scorpion! Now I will have to go and take a bath to purify myself. And it was a new dhoti and shirt I put on this morning!\" And Bakha's day does not improve. He is thrown off the steps of the temple where wandered to listen to the prayers and try to see into the temple although he knew his presence would \"pollute\" the temple and it would then have to undergo a purification ceremony. He must then go to a row of houses to beg for bread for his family. When finally some is thrown to him, it falls to the ground where he picks it up to bring it home to his father, sister and brother. Bakha actually displays a love of life that is momentarily depressed by these events, but which rises to the fore over and over. At the end of the day, Bakha is mystified by a Christian missionary who tries to \"save\" him from his untouchability through Jesus, an unexpected opportunity to hear (but not understand) the great Mahatma Gandhi expound his ideas for changing Indian society, and a local dandy explaining the ultimate solution to the problem of the untouchables--flush toilets. Bakha ruminates on the meaning of it all. Hopeful again, he turns for home to tell his father about Gandhi and the new machine--the flush toilets. \"Untouchable\" was a contemporary story. It is still a stirring account of the basic humanity of those members of the lowest castes of Indian society, and the wretchedness of their lives."

The book is an account of a boy named Bakha, son of lakha, being a sweeper he was not allowed to be entered into the temples and other Hindu religious places as well as the homes of upper caste Hindus. Bakha liked to play hokey and dress like Sahibs and white people of the England, in suit and pants, but he wasn’t allowed to do such things. His father abused him a lot and the family of four people used to fed over the left-overs of the weddings or the breads lying near the filthy sewers. Their life was utterly miserable!! The book is based upon the idea of untouchability and emphasises on the abolition of it. There are many such instances in the novel where you’ll get disillusioned about the Indian society during the English era."

And I mean Mulk Raj Anand isn't a terrible writer, he's just very much of a time and a place, and very much in debt to 19th Century English and Russian fiction, what with the journey of the individual as he learns the world within a day, complete with a long dialogue at the end between various intellectuals that kinda smacks you over the head with its message. If you have a strong interest in India, it's probably worth your time, but I'm a bit hesitant to recommend it across the board."

        "text":"Many years ago I came across the author's name on a Thai paperback entitled จัณฑาล [presumably transliterated from Chandal (p. 92)] on some occasions in those Bangkok Book Fairs but I hadn't read and rarely heard of him. Later I have eventually known him as an eminent Indian fiction writer in English, a contemporary of R. K. Narayan, Ahmad Ali (Pakistani) and Raja Rao ( https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Mulk_Ra... ) whose pioneering English novels based on Indian rural life and plight started to gain international readership around 1930s-1960s. As for me, I have long known and read only R. K. Narayan due to probably his literary popularity and availability of his new reprints or second-hand books in Thailand. Coming to think of giving the others more credit and attention, I think I would read him more as well as Ahmad Ali and Raja Rao whenever I can find their interesting works. I found reading this fiction illuminatingly entertaining and objectively narrated since it has explored the life of an 18-year-old Indian outcaste named Bakha, an Untouchable in the Indian caste system, who works as a sweeper and latrine-cleaner. We can see that such menial toil is bitterly despised due to its filthiness, disgrace and dishonor, in other words, people tend to look down upon them as those in the low society or the lower class; they thinking they are in the high society or in the upper class. However, the author has amazingly revealed his literary expertise by means of his narratives tinged with his sense of humor in which we can enjoy reading with some tongue-in-cheek words in the extracts that follow: He shivered as he turned on his side. But he didn't mind the cold very much, suffering it willingly because he could sacrifice a good many comforts for the sake of what he called 'fashun', by which he understood the art of wearing trousers, breeches, coat, puttees, boots, etc. as worn by the British and Indian soldiers in India. (p. 12) Almost a model 'gentreman', Bakha thought him, the kind of person he admired and wanted to imitate. (p. 39) And he had felt a burning desire, while he was in the British barracks, to speak the tish-mish, tish-mish which the Tommies spoke. (p. 44) Moreover, his text also include an unexpected usage of word like 'attack' denoting Bakha's action in the context, rather than an attempt to cause damage to enemy ( https:\/\/en.wiktionary.org\/wiki\/attack... such a usage surprisingly being rarely found in other novels, especially the third excerpt in which I couldn't help wondering at first reading how he 'attacked' the package in question or if it's Dr. Anand's satire-like sense of humor, for instance: He hardly realized that he had lapsed into activity, so vigorously did he attack his job. (p. 23) He was a bit scared by the sudden unwinding of the wheel. Then he pulled himself together and renewed his attack. (p. 32) His mouth was watering. He unfolded the paper in which the jalebis were wrapped and put a piece hastily in his mouth. The taste of the warm and sweet syrup was satisfying and delightful. He attacked the package again. (p. 52) In conclusion, this novel is arguably worth reading due to its exceptional writing style, seemingly realistic plot as well as amazingly appropriate word choices in which you can enjoy and enrich your lexicons while reading on and on. Decidedly, I would find his other books and look forward to reading them more."

An account of one day in Bakha's life who belongs to the lowest caste, was a street sweeper and latrine cleaner. Story about him and his gloomy circumstances which were engulfing his aspirations of being a 'Sahib' slowly. The story ends which a inspiring note where Bakha listened to Mahatma Gandhi about emancipation of the untouchables. Story is set up in pre independence era where India was infected by caste system, though it still prevails in some parts. Authors writing is very strong and has captured perfectly the plight of lower caste people. I somehow felt that it was more like an awareness story about the caste system which we all have learnt during our school time. It's sad, depressing and few scenes are quite sickening but I assume that they must be real somewhere. Its a masterpiece in terms of showing the real picture about how the lower castes which treated. Language is easy and understandable. I felt pity and sympathetic towards Bakha many times while reading. I bow down to Dr. B.R. Ambedkar who uplifted the lower caste. I will completely recommend this book because though the Bakha character is fictitious but still he is present somewhere in India."
